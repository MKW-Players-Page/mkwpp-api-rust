278	1546	weekly	2013-01-15	In a particularly quiet week, Tim's solid ~2.2 point / ~2.7% AF cut stood out. He moved up 2 places to 50th with only 3 PR's.

281	1539	weekly	2012-12-22	With one last strong push, Thomas finally passed Shaun Tanney to become the new site champion. 6 PR's and an impressive ~.8 AF cut helped prove that his lack of SR's didn't mean that he hadn't earned his crown.
282	924	weekly	2012-12-15	Leo had a solid 4 PRs and a 1.4 AF cut in the Top 10, moving from 8th to 7th. His continued activity has been a spark of light in the otherwise mostly dark top group.

289	1539	weekly	2012-10-22	After persistent effort to continue his progress at the top, Thomas was finally rewarded with the #3 spot this week. He cut exactly 1 point of AF--no mean feat at this level--which was just enough to pass Marc Bas.

295	354	weekly	2012-09-01	Mr. Crutcher's activity crushed all competition this week. An outstanding 13 PR's cut ~9 points and ~9% from his AF, propelling him from #68 to #61.

286	354	weekly	2012-11-15	Daniel clearly took this award, with 4 PRs and an AF cut just over one point. He also moved up a spot from 50th to 49th.
297	320	weekly	2012-08-15	Cole's set of 5 PR's was one of the best earned this week. It netted him a ~1.73 AF cut and bumped him up a spot to 20th.

302	354	weekly	2012-06-22	While other players went off on summer vacations, Daniel kept up his activity with 9 PR's. Cutting ~5 points of AF, his encore performance was enough to earn the award for the second week in a row.
303	354	weekly	2012-06-15	Daniel broke into the Top 100 in style, with an impressive 26 PR's. His ~14.4 AF cut was more than twice as large as his nearest competitors' by both points and percentage, propelling him forward 8 places to 100th on the dot.
304	1381	weekly	2012-05-22	There was fierce competition among various top players this week, but Salvatore just barely edges out the others by virtue of more consistent updating. His massive 12 PR load took off ~1.95 points/~4.79% from his AF and bumped him up one spot to #16.
305	924	weekly	2012-05-15	Despite neither earning the most PR's nor improving his rank, Leo had the best non-hoarded AF cut in the Top 100 by a comfortable margin, knocking off ~1.92 points/~4.11% with 5 PR's.

307	1539	weekly	2012-05-01	With not a soul outside the Top 100 stirring, Thomas cruised to an easy victory this week. His 5 PR's allowed him to overtake Aruba for the #9 spot and earned him a hefty 1.5 AF cut.
308	746	weekly	2012-04-15	With little activity and only a few hoarders as his competition, John stepped up this week. 4 PRs bringing a 1.7 AF cut and a two place improvement, he ran away with the award this week.
309	91	weekly	2012-04-08	Though there was a good bit of activity among the top players, Andre outshined them all. 10 PR's netted him an 8 place improvement and an ~8.67 point/~9.46% AF cut, the best in the Top 100.
310	1381	weekly	2012-04-01	Salvatore made a return to MKWii this week, quickly earning 6 PR's and cutting ~1.16 points of AF, enough to bump him up a spot to #20.

312	746	weekly	2012-03-15	Brunn had the best non-hoarded week of all at the top. With 3 PRs, a .34 AF cut, and a one place improvement, he kept playing when others went silent.

316	1315	weekly	2012-02-15	In a week of overwhelming inactivity, Rein stood head and shoulders above the rest. With 4 PR's, he shaved off 4.375 AF, roughly ~9.18% of his total, and leaped from #23 to #18.
317	924	weekly	2012-02-08	A strong 8 PR week allowed Leo to take this one despite solid competition from the other players. He moved from #44 to #37 and cut ~4.7 points/~6.8% from his AF.
318	1315	weekly	2012-02-01	Reinier ran away with the award this week. With just 5 deft PR's, he jumped 9 places to 23rd and cut ~11.1 AF, nearly twice as much as the next biggest cut.
319	1315	weekly	2012-01-22	Despite respectable activity from the rest of the field, 3 solid PR's were all it took for Rein to win this award. He moved up 4 spots to 32nd by cutting ~4.17 points of AF, ~6.55% of his total.
320	1539	weekly	2012-01-15	Thomas took advantage of a quiet week to break into the Top 10 with 6 PR's. ~2.81 points, or ~8.67% of his total AF, were enough to propel him forward 4 places to #8.
321	924	weekly	2012-01-08	In all the Top 100, no one could keep up with Leo in any category this week. He made the most PR's (15), cut the most AF (9 points, or 10%), and gained the most positions (6 places, to 55th).

324	1539	weekly	2011-12-15	With a solid 5 PR's, Thomas finally made it past an AF gap and gained another place. He cut ~1.56 AF, just over 4% of his total.
325	746	weekly	2011-12-01	For non-hoarded players, John Brunn stood above the rest. His two PRs netted him a 1.34% AF cut, which was better than the other regularly-active players could do.
326	947	weekly	2011-11-08	Although not the highest-ranked player active, Marvin wins the award for being one of only two Top 50 players to gain places and for having the largest non-hoarded percentage cut at ~4.7%. Two Top 10 times among 9 PR's sealed the deal.
327	383	weekly	2011-10-22	With 24 PRs, Dave tore it up this week with a great 12 point AF cut. They may be hoarded, but some Top 10 times combined with minimal activity elsewhere seals the award.
328	91	weekly	2011-10-15	Very low activity at the top let Hoelscher take this. Moving from #90->#82 with 10 PRs, he dropped 10 AF points or 7.9% off of his score.

332	215	weekly	2011-09-15	Bob Holden's solid week beats everyone else's off week. 5 PRs and a 1.17 AF cut was the best anyone had to offer. Holden takes the POW and moves from #39 -> #38.
333	1187	weekly	2011-09-08	Spots #2-4 were all active, but the highest gets the POW. Meade comes back with 7 PRs and a 2.1 point AF cut (15%), to fight off Batten and Tanney. If he hadn't played, both would have passed him.
334	652	weekly	2011-08-22	Jak Russo proves his slot in the Top 10. With 16 PRs an a 24% AF cut (Moving from #10 -> #6), he shut out any competition for the POW.

592	729	monthly	2010-01-01	Jimmy wins due to his 9 place move while already being in the Top 20. He went from #20 -->#11, and hit a massive 45 PRs along the way.
593	674	monthly	2009-11-01	27 of the top 30 played, but only one made a huge cut for that high of a position. Without one single strong week Jamie quietly made his way up 4 spots from #20 --> #16
594	689	monthly	2009-10-01	Jason was the one shining force in this quiet month. While others made two place moves, Jason jumped up from #32 --> #24, after breaking a quarter of his records.

601	394	monthly	2009-03-01	The most conclusive month for any player since these awards were started. David won every single POW, and richly deserves the POM, gaining 5 Site Records, making a 60% cut to AF, and becoming Site Champion!

603	394	monthly	2009-01-01	David missed out on the POW awards this month, but is easily the best overall. Joining the site at #24 and cutting 44% in his first month to finish #14

608	229	monthly	2008-08-01	Brendan takes this month by storm having narrowly missed out last month. His 50% cut in AF, and 5 Site Records to end up 3rd was enough to seal it this time around.
609	1438	monthly	2008-07-01	Really close this month between Brendan and Shaun who put in a similar amazing effort this month. Shaun edges it by making a huge 75% cut and passing 28 players to finish in 5th.
610	1093	monthly	2008-06-01	An easy decision this month. Michael has been far and away the best player, taking a massing 60% off his AF, and adding 5 SRs to his collection  to finish the month in the #2 spot.

616	665	quarterly	2022-04-01	Over this Quarter, I believe it's safe to say that James is the Karter who has improved the most. He started outside top 300, thinking he could only go as far as Top 250, ye now he's Top 150 and has some Oceanic Tops under his belt. Limits can be pushed.
