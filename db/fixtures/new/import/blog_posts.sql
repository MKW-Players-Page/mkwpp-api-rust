240	News update???	<p><b>Hey all TTers and TTesses. I am Arvo, your new news updater. You will learn to love me. Since Thomas and J-Cop are pretty busy guys, we came to the agreement that we needed someone new, preferably someone with way too much free time. I think I fit this description perfectly, so I'll hopefully be writing these more than the community has been used to over the past year or so. Without too much more rambling, let's recap the nearly four months of progress we've made. This is my first time doing this, and all the data is quite overwhelming and I'm bound to make a few mistakes sooooo... Go easy on me?<br><br>This news update covers from March 12th to July 3rd 2019<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime>Shatterdpixel , Jacob Loerzel , Steven Quincy , Mick Lorenger , Indy Kambeitz , Enzo Leussink , Tristan , BuzzyWuzzy , Alex Wolf , Alexander W , NateSM , Peyton Gunn</font> <br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br>First of all let's clap it up for the main man <font color=yellow>#1 Justin Hitchcock</font>. Very soon after the last news update he manage to pass Fox as our newest site champion. Fox held the #1 spot for a HUGE 1426 days until someone finally beat him. Great job Justin, I'm guessing he's gonna be site champ for at least 1000 days aswell. Oh yeah, he also got 28 PR's since the last update and now holds 48/48 American tops. Insane. Next up is <font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font>, that's me! Over the past few months I set 17 PR's and cut 2.5 AF. I played a lot of flaps and managed to snag 3rd worldwide during the Sherbet Land revolution. Those tops lasted about 3 days.<br><font color=yellow>#6 David Morton</font>, the Geordie machine has been playing aswell. The 2nd worldwide curse continued for him when he finished a Sherbet Land glitch time only around 2 frames behind the WR at the time. Ouch. I know you can do it mate! The next player to have improved is <font color=yellow>#7 Zed R</font>, who managed to get 14 PR's and cut around 1 AF. Since he is German, I will also mention that he got the Maple Treeway Country Record! Glückwunsch!<br>Next up, the veteran himself <font color=yellow>#8 Nick Meade</font>. Even though his Race to 9999vr has been keeping him occupied, he's still managed to find some time to get a couple of new PR's over these months, mainly glitch tracks like MT and rDH for some of that fat AF. He managed to cut 1.6 AF with only 5 PR's so it's definitely working. I also would like to give him a special shoutout for all the work he's been doing on his YouTube channel to keep the TT scene fresh with his high-quality Time Trial-related videos. Major respect to you brother. And then over to <font color=yellow>#9 Vincent Braixen</font> who's been religiously grinding for the rYF record, which he finally achieved in late May. He was also the second person to sub 1:56 on Coconut Mall no-glitch and the second person to sub 2:00 on DKM glitch. Great stuff, Brak! (Oh yeah he also managed to climb 2 placements with these, mostly due to a big oopsie that we'll get to at the end).<br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br>First up, <font color=yellow>#18 AJ Rangthale</font>. Sosis managed to improve his Sherbet Land no-glitch WR twice recently and even managed to get a glitch time! He also managed to come out of nowhere with a 5th Worldwide time on Mario Raceway, until he was pushed back to 6th by a certain robotic mastermind. He managed 5 PR's (and at this point I'm realizing the stats only count PR's on the combined rankings). Anyways, congratulations Sosis, good luck for more on Sherbet Land!<br>Next is <font color=yellow>#22 JoshuaMK</font> who recently improved his LC time by just 25 milliseconds, but he managed to hit a 22 second lap 3 in his run. Boy's got potential! <font color=yellow>#23 Ruby Aruba</font> also improved twice since the last update, the main thing to look at here is his 2nd worldwide and the 2:12 sub on rDKJP no-glitch. Congrats Aruba, I'm sure that has been way overdue. Next up is the angry scot RC - <font color=yellow>#24 Ross Coleman</font>. He's managed a gnarly 25 PR's since the last update, the main things being his 3 different WR's on the rSL glitch and worldwide tops on rSL no-glitch. Icy tracks for the Iceman. Cutting off a massive 8.7 AF and climbing 6 positions since the last update, he's actively trying to become the #1 spearscrub in all of MKW, achieving the Spear BKT on Mushroom Gorge and always trying to find ways to PR with the spear on any track possible, including Maple Treeway no-glitch. I'm sure he'll try to make 3/3 DKM glitch with spear at some point in the future. <font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> has been playing a lot aswell, he's been keeping up busy over at MKLeaderboards, having to update almost every single one of his improvements on the European tops. He's achieved 16 different PR's and cutting almost 4 AF. Still, due to Ross' improvements, Steve managed to drop a spot in the rankings.<br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Danny Gallenberger</font> attended SGDQ! Other than that, he also managed to get 2 PR's over these months. Due to the rSL glitch revolution, he managed to find the motivation to get himself a nice improvement, the other improvement being the flap in the same run. Good going Danny! <font color=yellow>#29 Aziz Abdullah</font> has also found some time to play, managing to get a very impressive 3rd worldwide on Moonview Highway. Congrats!<br><font color=yellow>#31 Alex Shoal</font> managed to do what he does best, he's been slowly climbing up the tops on Peach Gardens with automatic, currently sitting in 6th place. He also beat the Mick's ancient Spear BKT on MMM and improved his time on rYF. Keep it up dude! Then the other Canadian. <font color=yellow>#33 Jascha Richter</font> improved his already insane rMR time by another .1 and then disappeared again. I wonder when and where he's going to strike again. <br>Next is my man <font color=yellow>#34 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> who cut over 6 AF with his 15 PR's. He's been mostly improving his timesheet on the search for overall improvement but did go out of his way to make sure the rSL revolution didn't happen without him. He's still hanging on to 10th worldwide there, but I'm sure with how the things are going there, he's going to have to fight to hold on to those tops! <font color=yellow>#36 Dane Allen</font> has cut off nearly 9 AF and climbed up 5 spots on the rankings to be next to the other Dane. Aww! But <font color=yellow>#38 Jake Harrison</font> might be splitting them up soon, because he's managed to gain a monstrous 17 AF and climb 13 positions with his 22 PR's. Insane! Next, everyone's favourite instant miniturbo-using <font color=yellow>#41 Timothy Santoro</font> has also gained a huge 11.5 AF points and climbed 9 positions with 10 improvements, one of them being the WR with my personal favourite Mii name out of any WR! Congrats on the gains bro.<br>Up next is <font color=yellow>#45 Caleb House</font> who managed to barely miss the 50 second sub on MC glitch but regardless, his time has come a long way from 592. He improved on LC aswell, and hopped on for the rSL revolution. He may or may not also be aiming for the 2/3 glitch there. Only time will tell if king Taylor will reign for eternity. Just being able to write <font color=yellow>#48 WiiLord95</font> on this news update sparks joy. He may only have gotten 1 improvement, a Mario Circuit glitch flap just over a week after the last news update, but he'll be back. Be ready. July 9, 2019. (Please don't improve MC no-glitch the tie needs to stay :()<br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#51 Hunter Wells</font> played Sherbet Land. Next! <br><font color=yellow>#56 Paul Machala</font> hit too many insane times to list, but let's mention his rDH no glitch WR and the 3rd worldwide on WGM no glitch. I hope to see his name on here next news update, too! <font color=yellow>#60 Carter Clem</font> hates BC3. He got a couple of other PR's but the main one was definitely getting worldwide tops back on MT glitch. Congrats! <font color=yellow>#67 Lachlan Young</font> managed just one PR on rWS, but it's enough to get his name here! Now here's the big one. <font color=yellow>#68 Wilf Lovatt</font> has managed to cut off an insane 68.4 AF with 31 PR's climbing 66 positions! Absolute unit. I'm sure the big one for him was improving his rDH glitch time for the 100th time to get 6th worldwide. Congratulations, this was the biggest AF gain out of everyone during this timeframe.<br><font color=yellow>#73 Mo No</font> has been consistently setting PR's here and there. This time he's managed to get 6 of them. Straight quote from him: "The less I play, the more often I pr". Keep doing what makes you happy, mein freund! Next up is another man who's improved a ton over the past few months. <font color=yellow>#94 Vincent Nguyen</font> managed to cut over 48 AF and climb 42 spots since the last update, really getting some strong times aswell, such as his 7th American on GV2 glitch as well as 2/3 on DKJP glitch which somehow doesn't make regionals. Madness, I tell you.<br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#108 Yoshi Christan</font> took a break from telling me to do better in lounge and set 2 PR's, one of them being the big 2:31 on rBC. Congrats Christan, now let me hit walls in peace. <font color=yellow>#117 Logan Tracey</font> does not hit walls. He flexes on opponents, even getting the first ever tied WR on a glitch category with Ross on rSL. Logan cut off 8.6 AF and has been gunning for the 1:28 on Daisy Circuit. You can do it. <br><font color=yellow>#123 Tom Norton</font> dressed up as Funky Kong. He also managed to get closer and closer to reclaiming his rDS WR from Luke, but fell just a bit short. Let's hope you get it one day or AI will take over. <font color=yellow>#153 Shawn Berry</font> improved just 4 times, but managed to sub 1:51 on WGM no-glitch! Well done Shawn! Next, <font color=yellow>#158 Edvard Tsymbala</font> played Sherbet Land. He's keeping up his annual PR schedule, hope to see something from you in 2020! <font color=yellow>#161 Idriz</font> on the other hand went crazy over these months cutting 23.7 AF and climbing 17 positions. He also got one of the craziest WR's this year in my opinion with his 21.0 on MG glitch. Great stuff!<br><font color=yellow>#186 Daniel B</font> Loves Daisy a bit too much. He's improved on DKJP, getting worldwide tops and a great improvement on Daisy Circuit aswell. He also got a very fast 20.1 flap on rYF, thankfully with Funky this time. <font color=yellow>#197 Kenneth Bernales</font> finished his timesheet and has been updating his times very consistently. Welcome to the top 200!  :P<br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#241 Connor GB</font> managed to cut 48.6 AF and climb 38 positions with 24 PR's. Now that's sumtin to be proud of! <font color=yellow>#265 Jeroen Schepers</font> Finished his timesheet. Congrats and welcome! <font color=yellow>#284 Bradon</font> (Other Info: Twin brother of Zachary) got 1 PR, a 01:20.181 on rMC3. Good luck on sub!<br>And finally, a guy simply named <font color=yellow>#535 Tristan</font> also finished his timesheet. Let's go!<br><br>Site Records:<br><br><font color=yellow>Idriz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'22"406 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'21"015</font><br><font color=yellow>Idriz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'04"940 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04"466</font><br><font color=yellow>Bryce </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 0'49"721 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'49"092</font><br><font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'31"615 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31"554</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> time of 2'18"396 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'18"260</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape lap</font> time of 0'43"967 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'43"957</font><br><font color=yellow>Timothy Santoro </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 0'18"474 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'17"840</font><br><font color=yellow>Enzo Leussink </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano lap</font> time of 0'04"306 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'03"561</font><br><font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Yoshi Falls crs</font> time of 0'58"775 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'58"747</font><br><font color=yellow>Jascha Richter </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway crs</font> time of 1'41"464 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'41"358</font><br><font color=yellow>Blaze </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land crs</font> time of 1'43"133 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'36"697</font><br><font color=yellow>Blaze </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land lap</font> time of 0'16"529 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'11"220</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square crs</font> time of 2'04"451 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'04"296</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 crs</font> time of 1'57"981 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'57"627</font><br><br><br>As a bonus I'll add the no-glitch times aswell.<br></b><i>cough cough ego boost</i><b><br><br><font color=yellow>Arvo Koskikallio </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge no-glitch flap crs</font> time of 0'31"396 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31"376</font><br><font color=yellow>Joe Beaton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall no-glitch crs</font> time of 1'55"793 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'55"731</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine no-glitch crs</font> time of 1'50"705 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'50"663</font><br><font color=yellow>Blaze </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano no-glitch crs</font> time of 1'52"060 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'51"726</font><br><font color=yellow>AJ Rangthale </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land no-glitch crs</font> time of 2'03"921 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'03"825</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul Machala </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills no-glitch crs</font> time of 1'34"700 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'34"520</font><br><br><br>One more thing, just in case someone is unaware, Dennis Colvin turned out to have cheated a lot of his runs and admitted to being an alt of Zomothy (Who I to be honest, don't have a clue who he is).

241	3 Minutes 1 Attempt	<p><b>As the title says, this month the absolute legend cf found probably the funniest glitch in MKW so far. The Shy Guy Beach flap-only glitch where you have to wait 3 minutes for the Shy Guys to commit a terrorist attack at just the right place of THEIR OWN TRACK to somehow generate airtime from a powerful explosive. Great job Nintendo! Thanks to this, I'm predicting that there will be a lot of people who have had exactly one improvement over these three weeks. Let's get into the update gamers!<br><br>This news update covers from July 4th to July 28th 2019<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime>Tubiek , Victor Alicea , Shane Hogan, Omar Martinez Ramirez</font> <br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Justin Hitchcock</font> got a 17 second flap on rSGB in like 2 days and made everyone else look like a bunch of fools. He also got the first sub 11 flap on rSL glitch and a snazzy PR on rMR. He also managed to sub 7 AF and sub 14 minutes on the overall flap times. It's been a pretty flap-oriented month as you can tell. <font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font> is busy filling the huge void between 15-30 AF, it's pretty chill here. I've been playing everything BC3 and some rSGB on the side. Unfortunately the progress has been a bit slow so I only managed 2 PR's and the big 2:17 on no-sc after sucking for 4 days.<br>Next up is <font color=yellow>#6 Big Dave</font> who also participated in the popular pastime for waiting 3 minutes and shouting at the hitbox of an explosive device. He did manage to get a flap there eventually though, congratulations mate! Next, <font color=yellow>#9 Vincent Braixen</font> improved his CM glitch WR once again. He started playing a bit of Wii Sports after that but also managed to get a rSGB flap on day 1. 4/4 people so far have had a SGB flap, this is going to be a fun news update.<br><br><font color=red>Ross Coleman</font><br><br>So yes, the only player to improve from 11-25 this month is  <font color=yellow>#23 Ross Coleman</font>. He managed to transform into the Flying Scotsman and get an 18 second flap on rSGB. He also played 3lap on rSGB and recounted most of the swear words in the English language (and some other Scottish nonsense) while missing lows on lap 3. Good luck for regionals laddie. Ross also crushed Aruba, climbing one spot.<br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#31 Alex Shoal</font> is loving automatic and slowly climbing the rPG leaderboards, passing his fellow Canadian Jascha. He's currently sitting in 5th place. Congratulations! Another man from the Great White North, <font color=yellow>#32 Jake Harrison</font> might be the loudest man I've ever heard in my life but has also somehow screamed his way up 6 positions on the rankings, good job! There's too many improvements to highlight just one, but his potential on BC3 no sc shouldn't be overlooked. Top 25 this this year for sure, eh?<br><font color=yellow>#35 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> may have lost a spot to Jake, but he's been doing great work, on and off the track. He's been using the 3 minute waiting times on rSGB flap to benefit the community by going on adventures on ninrankings and chadsoft, keep up the work you legend! Jacob's mostly been playing flaps as he does, achieving the big 18 over on the waiting game category, but has also recently gotten into rGV2, getting flap tops and improving his 3lap time on the glitch category while also getting an impressive 53.3 on the no-glitch side. Next, <font color=yellow>#36 Dane Allen</font> slammed into the tree on rPB and disappeared. At least he's still next to the other Dane on the rankings. <font color=yellow>#39 Tony Ros</font> and <font color=yellow>#42 Mark Schmidt</font> have not returned to the game, but Jacob did some investigative work and found some missing times just so I could write their names on the news update. Thank you Jacob!<br><font color=yellow>#44 Caleb House</font> has been improving some of his older times but also got a 1:32 on rDH glitch and managed to join in the rSGB waiting squad with a very low 19 second flap. Good job Mr. House! <font color=yellow>#46 David McPartland</font> has gotten his name mentioned thanks to Jacob again, I'm pretty sure. I dread that this is not the last time I will get to write <font color=yellow>#48 WiiLord95</font> on here, he made a <u>controversial</u> exit video over on his youtube channel, but I hope to see him play here and there again, good luck with whatever you do regardless :) To end this group of players we have <font color=yellow>#48 Hunter Wells</font> who climbed his way onto the top 50 during this timeframe thanks to his ALL UMBRELLAS OPEN BKT on the supreme category. Great job fella.<br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#51 Clement Rouchon</font>, <font color=yellow>#58 Jamie Disley</font>. Thanks Jacob! Let's get to people who actually played. <font color=yellow>#61 Wilf Lovatt</font> the Sheffield Superstar continued his AF gains by another 3.5 points. He also managed to finally get the 3/3 on rDH glitch and get 1:32 just like Caleb. He also climbed another 7 spots. See you in the top 50 next news update! <font color=yellow>#63 McCoy Brown</font> finished his timesheet so I had to edit this news update. Good job pal! :) <font color=yellow>#75 Max Anosova</font>, <font color=yellow>#83 Robert van Zanten</font> and <font color=yellow>#84 Mickael Smolen</font> have not played either. Jacob giving so many shoutouts to old players, thank you again! <font color=yellow>#90 Vincent Nguyen</font> on the other hand, has played. He climbed 4 positions on the rankings, but more importantly got himself WW tops on rGV2 glitch and regionals on GV glitch. Yes mate.<br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#107 Dylan Imhoff</font>. Starting to question if Jacob's the only one adding these times. Shoutout to Zack this time. <font color=yellow>#110 Darragh J</font> has surprisingly actually played. He got a new PR on MMM as well as a rDKJP improvement. Still, the archive page says he's got 6 new PR's this month so I'm still suspecting some Jacob effect. Talking about Jacob, <font color=yellow>#111 Yann Deptia</font> has apparently got 8 PR's even thought his last PR was in 2011. Nice. And with <font color=yellow>#123 Tim Shelbourne</font> getting 20 ghost PR's I'm going to only mention people that have played. Sorry for being a bit lost lads.<br><font color=yellow>#137 Michael Penninck</font> snatched himself a nice PR on rBC. <font color=yellow>#147 Alex Bjorkman</font> made his comeback earlier this month with some nice PR's, most notably a very nice time on rMC3. <font color=yellow>#160 Idriz</font> was on holiday but got right back to work when he got back. He played a few flaps but also tried his luck on GV glitch, getting pretty close to sub 20 there. Good luck Idriz! <font color=yellow>#192 Kenneth Bernales</font> managed to cut 1.1 AF with 7 PR's and climbed 6 positions on the rankings. Good job!<br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br>My fellow map enthusiast <font color=yellow>#219 Leon Bisschops</font> finished his timesheet with 8 PR's this timeframe. Congrats maatje! <font color=yellow>#234 Neige LDN</font> was mental this month. He got 29 PR's and cut a massive 37 AF climbing 27 positions. Great job! <font color=yellow>#262 Jeroen Schepers</font> cut 11 AF and climbed 5 positions with 13 PR's. Very impressive! Next up is <font color=yellow>#269 Aaron Burr</font> who finished his timesheet this month. Good job and thank your for appreciating quality music. The twin brother of Zachary is back again, <font color=yellow>#281 Bradon</font> climbed up 5 spots with 12 PR's. Nice! Next up is the MKDS madman <font color=yellow>#302 Max Itzkowitz</font> who came back to get a couple of PR's. He is also not European. Good job, even though you're a yankee.<br>Then we get to the man who deserves a star sticker. <font color=yellow>#318 Darien L</font> managed to cut off a massive 55.6 AF climbing 41 positions with 22 PR's. Good job on doing a mass update Bawp, this was the biggest AF and spot gain this timeframe. And finally to end up the players, <font color=yellow>#330 MKWilliam</font> improved BCWii flap and 3lap. Go on lad.<br><br>Site Records: <br><br><font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'31"554 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31"481</font><br><font color=yellow>Skitty-san </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land crs</font> time of 1'36"697 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'24"746</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land lap</font> time of 0'11"220 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'10"880</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach lap</font> time of 0'25"190 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'17"986</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'30"797 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'30"778</font><br><br>No-Glitch: <br><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano no-glitch lap</font> time of 0'35"857 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35"688</font><br><font color=yellow>AJ Rangthale</font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land no-glitch crs</font> time of 2'03"825 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'03"750</font><br><br><br>These 3 weeks have been pretty mad, the TAS community went ahead and found 3 ultras in 24 hours, we managed to get double digits on the WR counter for the 8th month in a row and most importantly, we have a new #1 meme category.

Cheers and a friendly reminder to everyone to stay hydrated in this weather.<br><br>- Arvo </b></p>	t	2019-07-28 11:09:21+00	4
242	Jacob Fitzgibbon appreciation post	<p><b>Hey yall, Arvo here with another news update for all you intellectual meme lovers. This one is dedicated to Jacob Fitzgibbon or Arrow for doing an inhumane amount of snooping to find people's times. Good job and respect to him. Unfortunately due to this I might mess up some minor things with the dates, bare with me. I'm also going to reformat the update a bit, hopefully making it easier to read. Feel free to criticise, but it looks nicer to me.<br><br>We had some good stuff this month, 2/3 on rSL was finally done with magikruiser, which led to a WR cut of almost 7 seconds and the GV glitch WR saga continued - truly one of the greatest WR battles of the modern era of MKW. We might be running out of time for the monthly double digit WRs though, we only have 4 more days to get 2 more WRs. Let's make it happen.<br><br>Let's get into the things that a news update is supposed to talk about though. Those improvements and the statistics. And remember, stats don't care about your feelings.<br><br>This news update covers from July 29th to August 27th 2019<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime>Mickle , Nathan Socholotiuk , Gabe R , Josh Nebeker , Ju Ki , Parker Johnson , Joeey , Thomas Capel (why is he allowed on the site) , Jason Naill </font> <br><br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Justin Hitchcock</font> kept up the grind once again. He asserted dominance over Braixen on Maple Treeway glitch, cutting over 3 seconds over Braixen's former WR with 2 improvements. He also momentarily lost rDS regionals, knocking him back to //only// 47/48. He got them back within a couple of weeks. And if that wasn't enough he got flap WRs on BC3 shortcut and DKM no glitch. Get in there lad.<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font> got in trouble with the Finnish government for not being home to receive a letter and cannot pay rent on time next month. So naturally, he has been playing unhealthy amounts of MKW. I started with choking sub 2 on BC3 shortcut on the last straight, rapidly moved on to choking run after run on CM ng, and went on the best form I've ever had in this game by getting 2 miracle runs on Maple Treeway in 2 days. I also had time to pray for correct inputs for hours on WGM and GV glitches. It's been a fun month.<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Nick Meade</font> has made his mark this month by getting a nice time on GV2 no glitch. Some of his recent missing times was also added by the namesake of this news update.<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Vincent Braixen</font> achieved a solid time on TF as well as subbing 2:13 on DKJP no glitch. Well done, Vincent #1.<br><br><br><font color=red>Ross Coleman (and others)</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Olivier Luyckxckqkqckckcckks</font> also subbed 2:13 on DKJP. Good feat mate, keep it up and please get a better last name in your next life.<br><br><font color=yellow>#16 AJ Rangthale</font> was mostly occupied by his Annoying Orange bingewatching but regardless, he did get a few glitch PRs because of McRaren trying his hardest to bring him down. <br><br><font color=yellow>#21 Ross Coleman</font> is being worked to death by the evil capitalist swines at his local Iceland. Because of the clear oppression and multiple human rights violations, Ross fell into a dark place and started to play the most despicable, disgusting categories this game has to offer as a punishment to himself. Ross decimated the rSL glitch WR after weeks of grinding for 2/3, got GV flap WR after not so long, improved on CM glitch flap and is now playing GV glitch with the TAS entry. Ross, if you read this, please get help.<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Jake Harrison</font> climbed another 4 spots this month with his consistent improvements. He was angry at a certain highway and decided to take out his anger towards rDH. He also got a solid TF time earlier this month. He has also still not stopped the screaming. Please for the love of God stop the screaming. 2.5 AF cut.<br><br><font color=yellow>#30 Aziz Abdullah</font> the legend found some time to play and set a time on Toad's Factory. Glad to see him still going!<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> has been so busy with MKW investigation that he hasn't had time to get as many improvements as he usually does. He has got a few though, cutting a lot of no SC AF but ended up dropping 0.3 on the combined ones. More next month, ye?<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 Dane Allen</font> has unfortunately broke away from the other Dane this month. SAD! He got a new GV2 PR. Fantastic.<br><br><font color=yellow>#41 Timothy Santoro</font> improved his WR but got fried like a shrimp on the barbie just over a week later. Still waiting for a comeback.<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Wilf Lovatt</font> is in the top 50. I repeat. <font color=yellow>#46 Wilf Lovatt</font> is in the top 50. Congratulations you madman. He got 32 improvements and cut over 25 AF. Keep up the grind, top 25 next.<br><br><font color=yellow>#48 Howdy Partner</font> managed to slide his way into this news update by improving 2 days after the last update. I like your style. You can play again now, Hunter.<br><br><br><font color=red>dancingswimmer</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#70 Vincent Nguyen</font> continued his grind for becoming Vincent #1 with 12 PRs, cutting a whopping 20 positions and over 14 AF. Solid.<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#112 Bryce</font> finally joined the cult of AF by finishing his timesheet. Congratulations but you are still a tyrannical dictator of the discord server and we need to spread awareness of your wrongdoings.<br><br><font color=yellow>#118 Logan Tracey</font> improved his DKM ng WR as well as his TF time. nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#128 Idriz</font> got like a thousand PR's, cut 36 AF, climbed 32 positions, changed his discord name 16 times and played rYF on the super blooper. Grats!<br><br><font color=yellow>#135 Indy Kambeitz</font> completed his timesheet. Welcome to the cult. We cherish you.<br><br><font color=yellow>#188 Kenneth Bernales</font> climbed only 4 spots with a AF cut of 8. Surprising. Regardless, great job on the improvements!<br><br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#219 Leon Bisschops</font> 11 PRs, 4 spots, 3.5 AF. Would say he likes maps but I now know that map stands for minor attracted person. Although, the MKW community doesn't have a shortage of those either soooo... (stay safe guys)<br><br><font color=yellow>#223 Neige LDN</font> got 11 PR's, cut 11 AF and climbed 11 spots. What are the odds.<br><br><font color=yellow>#240 Dante Dhillion</font> did actually get a few PRs this month but because Jacob is on steroids, I don't actually know how many. Good job anyway.<br><br><font color=yellow>#242 Aaron Burr</font> is sorry for the ping at 4:30 am but he's looking into buying a cheap capture card and he would like to know which one I use. He also climbed 41 AF and 27 spots with 23 PRs.<br><br><font color=yellow>#256 Jeroen Schepers</font> got some prs or something<br><br><font color=yellow>#272 Parker Johnson</font> got a timesheet or something<br><br><font color=yellow>#273 Darien L</font> got the biggest AF cut of the month once again, cutting over 64 AF and climbing 45 positions or something<br><br><font color=yellow>#300 Max Itzkowitz</font> PR'd on Koopa Cape.<br><br><font color=yellow>#322 Joeey</font> finished his timesheet.

243	Mario Kart Tour will die in time for the next update so I don't have to talk about it.	<p><b> What's cracking gamers, it's time for another session of trying to decipher the stat program from Jacob's mass updates. This month we had some decent developments, the big ones being: <br><br>Niyake claiming back his throne on GV glitch. The universe has once again returned back to it's natural state.<br>Cole not wanting a WR of his to last a long time and making his return to LC once again with a micro-improvement.<br>Blaze not hoarding something.  ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;)<br>Jonathan Corwin's 01:17.547 on Luigi Circuit.<br><br><br>We also <u>finally</u> made the Joining Info page accurate. Only 6 years late, not bad! <br><br>But yeah let's get in to the good stuff. <br><br><br>This news update covers from August 28th to September 27th 2019<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime>Ethan H, LeddaZ</font><br><br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Justin Hitchcock</font> did some working on his timesheet once again. He tackled some of his "weaker" times and managed to get WW tops on both BCWii and DDR. He kicked Bynt's ass on rPB and managed to get DDR flap WR along the way. Excellent job, Hitchcock.<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font> has been busy default dancing and hiding in bushes this month, but I did get a few PR's aswell. I improved on DKJP glitch, bopping Bryce on the Total Time stat, get destroyed fam. I also got 2 pretty nice subs on GV and MH. Could have been a lot worse.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 David Morton</font> is a filthy hoarder so I'm only going to mention his rMC and MH improvements. (But for real, thanks for letting me finally add that 19.399 l3 BKS, that's pretty epic).<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Olivier Luyckxccqqkckkqkqckckcckksckxcckqkqcckqkqkckcccqkkckqksckxckqkqckckcqkckksqqkkz</font> got a rYF time. <br><br><font color=yellow>#16 AJ Rangthale/Sosis/AJ Sosis/anngornge</font> improved his MMM WR by a whole 1 millisecond and then disappeared.<br><br><font color=yellow>#19 Ross Coleman</font> is a disgusting capitalist pig and a disgrace to the motherland. But he did get a couple of PR's on a few glitch tracks (and Koopa Cape). He's gonna get 2 glitches on rPB soon but he will probably hit the cataquack as a tribute to his favourite 12 year old.<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Marc Bas</font> is basically a celebrity for MKW standards so his name should give me more views. He apparently got a rPB improvement? He wasn't on Jacobs list found times soooooo, maybe?<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Ruby Aruba</font> got a rMC time. Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> got a time on rWS and DKS. Nice.<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Jake Harrison</font> wow you suck not even top 25 LOOOOOOOOOL get good scrub. Nice 2/3 on DKJP though, I am extremely jealous. Also kicked Bynt's ass. A lot less screaming this month, you are going the right direction in life. Except you're really not, stop drinking you alcoholic bob ross hair degenerate<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Daddy Gallenberger</font> whipped out the spear and did some glitching on BCWii. Not bad m8<br><br><font color=yellow>#32 Linguini888</font> added times religiously but also drove a few of his own aswell. He improved his rPB glitch flap to 2nd WW, .6 would be sick there. He subbed 1:19 on MC3 and 1:54 on rWS, and improved his old meme rDH glitch time. Keep up the good work Jacob!<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Alex Shoal</font> got ANOTHER improvement on rPG. I heard its for OG's so makes sense. :cool:<br><br><font color=yellow>#35 Wilf Lovatt</font> is some sort of superhuman so he climbed another 11 spots this month and cut 12 AF with 20 PRs. He played non-stop throughout the whole month except for when he attended the Sheffield MorgzFest.<br><br><font color=yellow>#37 Dane Allen</font> got the big 1:50 sub on DDR. <br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Cole Gilbert</font> improved his LC WR by 5 milliseconds, as I mentioned at the start of the update. He's never truly gone.<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#55 Carter Clem</font> climbed 6 positions, making his way closer to the top 50. Way too many improvements to list, but the rYF sub minute must be nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#62 Vincent Nguyen</font> is very unoriginal, he shares his last name with 1/3 of the Vietnamese population. He got a nice rSL glitch time though.<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#109 Bryce</font> spends too much time on his phone, the youth today is truly rotten! But before all that he was busy screaming at walls, trees and poles. He also got improvements on a ton of no-glitch tracks.<br><br><font color=yellow>#112 Indy Kambeitz</font> got 27 PRs and cut 23 positions! Also likes Moldova and San Marino in Eurovision so gets my respect instantly.<br><br><font color=yellow>#129 Idriz</font> played rYF (but not on Super Blooper this time!)<br><br><font color=yellow>#139 Michael Penninck</font> played DKM and MG glitch. Probably went wide around every goomba on the last turn on MG.<br><br><font color=yellow>#151 Alex Bjorkman</font> improved on rDS to make the update. Not bad.<br><br><font color=yellow>#190 Kenneth Bernales</font> still got a few PR's in. Maybe about 30 more next month?<br><br><br><font color=red>200-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#211 Leon Bisschops</font> got a ton of PR's but no huge AF cut like last time. Still, keep up the good work Kerkrade boy!<br><br><font color=yellow>#217 Aaron Burr</font>. About a million improvements. Again. Keep it up!<br><br><font color=yellow>#223 Neige LDN</font>. Not as many improvements as last month but still quite a few. Good job!<br><br><font color=yellow>#246 Connor GB</font> has returned to the grind and achieved many PRs. That's sumtin to be proud of, my friend!<br><br><font color=yellow>#251 Jeroen Schepers</font> got like a trillion prs or something<br><br><font color=yellow>#259 Darien L</font> got the biggest AF cut for the third month in a row. It was pretty close this time but he kept the streak going. Great job mate!<br><br><font color=yellow>#290 Cody Vanorder</font> ordered a van as a gift to nS David, I heard he also got a few PR's.<br><br><font color=yellow>#309 Alex Wolf</font> is the second best player on the AF rankings with the last name Wolf. He finished his timesheet, good!<br><br><font color=yellow>#330 Gaetan Charpentier</font> also finished his timesheet. Bien joué !<br><br><font color=yellow>#363 Quindarious Gooch</font> is definitely Ando's real name. Congrats on the PR's!<br><br><br>Site Records:<br><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Luigi Circuit crs</font> time of 1'08"887 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'08"882</font><br><font color=yellow>AJ Sosis </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows crs</font> time of 1'15"621 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'15"620</font><br><font color=yellow>Ross Coleman </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 0'17"664 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'17"197</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> time of 1'47"642 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'47"397</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins lap</font> time of 0'32"931 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'32"887</font><br><font color=yellow>Blaze </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'09"346 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'09"113</font><br><br>No no-glitch records this month if I'm not mistaken. Anyways, this was pain because the stat program told me that about 5000 people had set PRs because Jacob's work. Another big thanks to Jacob for keeping the site accurate!

So much shit happened this month and I'll try to mention the main things here:<br><br>RusoX and Nagisa got caught cheating. Because of this, rBC WR history is now almost as screwed up as my life, NMeade WR in 2017, Zane 1000+ day WR and Ruso setting a CTGP run back in 2015 to piss off Thomas who never had the WR because of it. Shame on you Ed.<br><br>Nagisa getting removed from the rDS leaderboards also got Sword a pity WR from 2010 which caused him to pass Fox on the overall WR count which is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen.<br><br>On a more positive note, Cole pushed through and achieved the a 1:08.774 on LC, which is in my opinion the strongest WR to date. <br>Luke pulled through on MC3 with a 1:17.889, which is objectively the most optimized WR in the game (closest to the BKS total). Crazy stuff from both of you.<br>Luke also finally pulled through with an exceptional run on rMC, reaching a 1:30.612. Still far from what's possible but insane for how difficult it is to be fast here.<br>Sosis also got the .4 on MMM, mad ting<br><br>Also huge shoutout to Kasey for finally getting the first non-Cole sub 1:09 on LC. Insane.<br>Also Bynt for getting 1:12 on rPB, from rags to riches, from 4DR to... well still 4DR, get that fixed asap rocky<br><br>Statistics time<br><br><br>This news update covers from October 27th 2019 to November 28th 2019<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime>Sam Hula , Alexander Malmros , Adam Evans , Bynt C. , Manon Tina , Thomas Voss , Dan Lewis , Chris Leon</font><br><br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Justin Hitchcock</font> will sub 6 AF once he posts his new MC glitch flap time, how is it even possible to be ranked this high on like everything I don't get it.

EXCELLENT JOB you afro bastard<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#32 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> improved his rDH glitch flap.

Please someone help this man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#89 Indy Kambeitz</font> cut a solid amount of AF with the help of many flaps, I can respect that.

Good one Gaetan.<br><br><font color=yellow>#372 Kaiser Virtuoso</font> went crazy this month with too many improvements to count (jk it was 25 on combined charts) and nearly 50 AF points cut. Mad, surely that has to be the biggest AF cut of the month.

246	Happy new year 2019!	<p><b>Happy end of the decade to all you nerds, I wanted to start this one off with a throwback to 10 years ago, so I'll encourage you to check the links here:<br><br><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231042514/http://mariokartplayers.com:80/mkw/afc.php" target="_blank">AF charts exactly 10 years ago</a><br><br><a href="https://www.mkwrs.com/mkwii/wrs.php?date=2009-12-31" target="_blank">WRs exactly 10 years ago</a><br><br><br>It's great to look back to a time where most of the current playerbase didn't even know what Mario Kart was. Special shoutouts to Nick Meade and Shaun Tanney for maintaining their impressively high PP rank to this day, and to Jascha, Niyake and McRaren, the ones from that snapshot who still hold WRs today. <br>A super special shoutout to McRaren, who reclaimed his WGM glitch WR after exactly 3400 days after he lost it last time, making it the longest WR comeback in the game's history.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Ok, enough about the past, it's time to focus on the present and future. Let's make the third decade of MKW a great one.<br><br>Highlights of the month:<br><br>TF glitch becoming RTA-viable, summoning a WR gold rush that's still going on since nobody has made it 2/3 yet.<br>Justin subbing 2:18 on Koopa Cape, stamping his name on one of the most impressive WRs and subs in the history of the game.<br>McRaren's great comeback on WGM, taking back his crown after over 9 years, as mentioned before.<br>David finally pulling through on rDH glitch, getting WR after months of grinding.<br><br><br>new year new stats<br><br><br>This news update covers from November 29th 2019 to December 31st 2019<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime><br>Fox Amex (We got an american express sponsorship)<br>Jordan Albanese (DDR former WR holder) <br>Chaos (not that one)<br>Neemo (trying to find him)<br>Watcha (probably another blackyboi alt)<br>Gustav A (Meme king)<br>Calum Sutherland (Hopefully not this placekicker that came up on google)<br>Klaus (BCWii only)<br>Mason Mustonen (Finnish last name!)<br>Brody Lassner (Rubik's cube enthusiast and youtuber)<br>Paul Allain (Co-founder of microsoft)</font><br><br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Just-fuck-him Hitchcock</font> managed to get a couple of TF WRs just after the glitch being found, most notably the first ever sub 1:48. He also got the KC WR (which inspired his name for this news update) as well as coming just 1 millisecond short of the mystical MC glitch flap WR. Those tops don't see much movement, it was great to see the mad lad revive some interest for the shroomless glitch. He also casually made WW tops on MT no glitch.<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font> has a cold and has been getting very little sleep tonight because of the family dogs, so his news update is going to be a mess once again. Regardless, it was a pretty great month for me, I made regionals on DC, cut off a ton of AF on rBC (finally reaching the sub 20!), managed to meme together a SGB glitch flap improvement and ended the month by jumping on the TF glitch bandwagon. It's more fun that it seems.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 David899</font> got his UK record on rDH glitch back and keeps getting fast clips on TF glitch. I'd say he's all around a pretty glitch reliant player. Also he seemed to have developed some sort of amnesia and can't remember his own last name. Get well soon!<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Vincent Braixen</font> is inching towards the CM ng wr, improving to a 1:55.808 just 10 days ago. He was also the first person to pull off the TF glitch RTA, so we can blame him for opening the floodgates. He did also manage to get a WR there, just before Logan started his domination.<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Nick Meade</font> joined the exclusive club on 1:21.970 on MC ng for a while, after abandoning us for glory, improving to a .8. He also got PRs on rWS and KC, as well as a DKM glitch flap improvement? Keep up the great TT content mate<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Zed R</font> finally got the sub 2 on rPG as well as sub 1:49 on DKS. He's surely grinding TF glitch as I'm writing this, the possibility of a new German Record is something he just cannot turn down.<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Ross Coleman</font> made up for last month's lack of stupid glitch categories by being the first one to get a proper TF glitch flap together. It's only fitting. Since his time on TF before the glitch wasn't too special, he was able to get a gigantic AF cut and move all the way up to 12th place. Top 10 soon. He also spent some time on MC glitch after the constant harassment he got for his time there. also he did some spear shit but he does that every month so not gonna talk about that lol<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 AJ Sosis</font> did manage to get KC WW tops in the end. Good job! hey buddy banana you'll move to havana and live in a cabana<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Jake Harrison</font> is playing TF no glitch flap while everyone else is playing glitch, what a rebel. Also got an improvement on rDH no glitch, I can only assume he want's to improve his most prized Canadian top category.<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Stavros Ferentinos</font> improved his MG no-sc time a ton, which helped him achieve his goal of sub 20 no-sc AF this month, big congrats to him! He also defended his score with a KC flap improvement.<br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> was another one who jumped on the TF glitch bandwagon as soon as possible. He managed to cut off a ton of AF with a flap and 3lap improvement, and makes his way into the top 30 for the very first time. Congrats Jacob!  :) A dangerous journey is ahead, however. He is approaching the nearly 8 AF point void between 26th and 27th place. May God be on your side during these difficult times that lay ahead.<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Alex Shoal</font> i think at this point its pretty obvious what he did. WR soon.<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 MKRFirestone</font> has been attempting TF glitch, but so far without a completed time. He did, however get a WGM flap improvement, which earns him a news mention for the first time in a while.<br><br><font color=yellow>#42 Caleb House</font> is becoming a normally functioning human, and playing less and less Mario Kart. The TF glitch discovery was just too much to turn down, though, and he just had to get a time. Because his no-glitch flap was not very well ranked, he somehow climbed 3 positions with that improvement. Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#43 Timothy Santoro</font> is now an army man, which is why he has not been heard from for a while. He did get Christmas off, so he continued where he left off on Rainbow Road, finally getting regionals there. Congrats Phyz, and good luck in your training :cool:<br><br><font color=yellow>#44 Carter Clem</font> didn't get as many improvements this month as he usually does, but he did still manage to grind out some Koopa Cape and climb another 2 positions, securing his top 50 spot even further.<br><br>To see what <font color=yellow>#48 Hunter Wells</font> did, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTqsMTaURrI" target="_blank">this video</a><br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#60 Vincent Nguyen</font> got an insane time on LC, just barely missing out from WW tops. Good luck if you decide to go for that! Towards the end of the month he, like many others joined the TF glitch grind. He has got a few really good glitches, wouldn't be surprised if goes big on this one.<br><br><font color=yellow>#64 Indy Kambeitz</font> what the hell how did you cut 25 positions in 1 month inside the top 100 what drugs are you on. Jokes aside, good job on the improvements, the one that sticks out is his new GV no sc Benelux record. Congrats, keep up the grind maatje<br><br><font color=yellow>#82 Bryce</font> seems to be directing his focus on cheesing his way up the BKS individual rankings, managing to TIE THE BKS TOTAL FOR 2 DIFFERENT MG GLITCH METHODS SO HE GETS MORE POINTS ON THE MOST OBSCURE RANKINGS IN THE GAME. He did get a TF glitch flap but since he is terrible at the game (worst WR holder) he didn't even PR on 3lap lol what a clown take the L noob<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#113 Logan BbirbPog</font> got his last name legally changed, but because of him grinding TF glitch for 2 days straight with no sleep, he fell asleep on the keyboard when he had to enter his new last name to the goverment system. Unlucky! Also his newest TF glitch WR was a 1:47.001 with a bounce after the last low. Unlucky!<br><br><font color=yellow>#114 The King of Portugal</font> finally got his timesheet completed. I struggle to understand how you had Portuguese record on every category, but not a complete timesheet. Lazy!<br><br><font color=yellow>#138 Michael Penninck</font> these are probably all old times anyways but still epic<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#153 Shawn Berry</font> returned to TTs briefly, getting the sub 1:48 on DDR. Congrats man, crazy to see how many 1:47s there are today, when it was just Infi for the longest time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#158 Matt Danner</font> made a return to the PP after three and a half years, always great to see a returning player. Welcome back! Also I swear this guy allied for a clan I was in back in 2012<br><br><font color=yellow>#178 Leon Bisschops</font> keeps asking me when I'm gonna do the news update. He grinded a ton of tracks as always, and got especially good at MH. He also got a 53.7 on GV2 no-glitch, very nice! Good luck for next month!<br><br><font color=yellow>#182 Kenneth Bernales</font> returned after no improvements last month and kept pushing down his timesheet. He's getting really close to rMR 1:42 and got a pretty good MC ng time (probably because of NMeade's challenge)<br><br><font color=yellow>#196 Aaron M</font> Not as many improvements as last month, but still quite a few. Thanks for the Best Known Pace video again :)<br><br><font color=yellow>#200 Michael Harmon</font> aka Av Orange posted, what I assume are all his TT improvements over the past 4 years or so. It was just enough to make top 200, but I think the thing he values more than that is his new WGM no glitch PR. Good job man.<br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#210 Jacob Loerzel</font> the rDKJP kid completed his timesheet. Welcome to the rankings.<br><br><font color=yellow>#219 Darien Lupton</font> is still steadily climbing towards the top 200. A very impressive 19 AF cut this month, keep up the grind mate.

Keep it up man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#447 Vincent Kwiecien</font> made a comeback after 3 years of no improvements. Great to see that, we now have 4 active Vincent's that TT.

He had a lot of times of his own this month (automatic, of course) but he's made some infamous remarks on discord that I'd like to highlight:<br><br>- "Isn't juice wrld a former DKS WR holder?"<br>- "What I mean is Bynt is now as good as Troy at MKW imo"<br>- "This guy Shaun is possibly one of the greatest TTers rn but has no WW tops.

He also played some DC, BCWii ng and rMR, getting great times on all 3 tracks. 5 AF is getting closer and closer.<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Thomas Van Deerse</font> <br>Steve 22/01/2020<br>thomas beat me back on AF<br>i told him he should play like the 5 tracks where he hasnt put effort in for nosc<br>to not allow bots like us to pass him that easily<br><br>BCWii was his track of choice this time, let's see what follows when Steve passes him on the no sc rankings again.<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font> I've been stuck on Toad's Factory for the entire month, battling for glitch flap wr, gunning for 1:49 ng (some day man) and destroying the pest that is Jake Harrison at ng flap. It's been fun but I'd like to play some other track this year.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 David899</font> is a nonce lol<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Vincent Braixen</font> finally got the CM WR. Very much looking forward to see how far he decides to push that, a 1:55.5 is looking like a very realistic possibility.<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Nick Meade</font> did eventually get the big 35 on rWS flap, seeing him play it, though, I can pretty safely say that he could push that to at least a 35.5 with a nice run. Let's see what he decides to go for next month!<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#11 Shaun Tanney</font> made a surprising comeback to TTs this month with a new TF ng PR. Great to see a PR from the man who's name can't be spelled properly by Copenhagen airport burger king workers.<br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Ross Coleman</font> has been on a religious grind for the TF glitch WR, getting around 16 (yes, 16) 2/3 glitch runs but not the WR. One of these days he won't choke and get the dream ending with a DK low and kill that category for good. Then he will cry because I will have gotten the first 31 glitch flap which is the more important category.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Oliver Luyckx (pronounced [l�"y̯k(s)])</font> has been on a mad Luigi Circuit grind, reaching 7th WW and raising the Belgian flag to international glory with pride and determination.<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 AJ Sosis</font> is pushing rDH to a level beyond my understanding. He could actually get the WR without a single wheeliecut which is just so insane. Good luck man, learn wheeliecut and 1:33 is yours. KNIFE!<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Jake Harrison</font>, you are nothing. The fact that you even entertain the idea of being able to outclass me in this game is laughable. You will never know what it meant to be on top of the flap competition. It's interesting how something so casual and easy proves to be such a challenge for unskilled players such as yourself. <br><br>This run was the result of 15 minutes of attempts on 0 sleep. It is truly unfortunate for you that you aren't as good as me at this video game. I hope you the best, but you know, you will always know, that I am by far the superior player, gamer and human out of us two. <br><br>I intentionally failed the landing at the end to give you a slight hope of some day beating my time. I know it will take you weeks of trying, and by that time I will already be comfortably in the 34's, a time you will never ever reach in your sad life. Goodnight.<br><br>He got PRs on KC and rMR and a bad time on TF ng flap.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Ruby Aruba</font> got a KC PR at the start of the month, back when it was still trendy to play KC. Sadly those times seem to be gone, as MKW overlord Luke has moved to rBC.<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Stavros Ferentinos</font> and I had a very sophisticated conversation about communism yesterday (stay mad ross). Before that lifechanging event he did manage to get PRs on KC (again, back when it was trendy) and avoided the .420 digits on rDH masterfully to show that drugs have no place in a healthy and happy society.<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> has been sending me interesting MKW statistical facts for the entire month, which I am very thankful for. Jacob has been at work on verious flaps, which is very typical of him. He also clutched out a great time on WGM glitch and also got a time on TF glitch. (at least its better than what bryce got LOL)<br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Danny Gallenburger</font> shut up your a burger<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Dane Allen</font> got pretty slick rBC3 ng and WGM glitch times this month, as well as an abundance of flap improvements. Good one big man Thunder1721<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 MKRFirestone</font> got a 1:55 on DDR and a 1:59 on CM. Quick reminder that this man was a long-time WR holder.<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Carter Clem</font> has been trackhopping quite a bit this month, still being able to push rBC to a pretty impressive 2:32.1. He also hit me up asking for advice on the rYF bridge stick, and I'm pretty sure he's beginning to understand that there is no method to that madness.<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#56 Indy Kambeitz</font> just doesn't stop climbing the ranks, cutting over 12 AF this month with another 22 improvements. Getting closer and closer to the top 50 dude, you'll get there soon.<br><br><font color=yellow>#58 Filler</font> made a return to the game in time for 2020, surprising the MKW world with a 2nd WW time on rBC. He followed that up with rSGB and MC improvements. Maybe some day he will start using his name again.<br><br><font color=yellow>#61 Vincent Nguyen</font> has been abandoning the trackhopping strategy and moved on to grinding almost exclusively TF. I know how it feels. Congrats on the glitch WW tops!<br><br><font color=yellow>#74 Bryce</font> has been very angry and is soon getting banned from twitter for excessive spamming. He got the worst time I've ever seen on TF glitch lol and has all around been very terrible at this game as of late lmao get good idiot moron<br><br><font color=yellow>#99 Kasper</font> made a return to TTs, getting times on rYF (59.6 with BB, woah), DKS and BC3. Great to see!<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#101 Benjamin Zenon</font> also came back to TTs and remembered what a terrible track MMM is, I don't know why he kept on playing it. He also struggled with the new CTGP rules outside of the PP and was giving me severe PTSD from trying to arrange clan wars with French people . <br><br><font color=yellow>#109 Logan BbirbPog</font> got the first ever 2/3 on TF glitch and is by his own words "never playing this again". Let's see if he holds on to that promise. He also made a mockery of everyone on rDH and doing the glitch recovery very fast, getting the WR after a short grind.<br><br><font color=yellow>#134 Daseia</font> took a quick break from CTWWs and decided to joined the PP. He also started quite possibly the biggest category drama by beating Blaze's MG ng WR with the wallride, great job idiot! bruh is better than daisy squad and I$<br><br><font color=yellow>#150 Matt Danner</font> unloaded another batch of times onto the PP during one week. Keep doing what you're doing fam<br><br><font color=yellow>#155 Shawn Berry</font> joined the rMR bandwagon, getting the 1:41 there along with so many others. Y'all make it look so damn easy.<br><br><font color=yellow>#157 Blake Germany</font> made quite possibly the most surprising return of the last few years, reclaiming his throne on DKS. Knowing how much he enjoys memes the majority of the community believed it to be a troll but it was actually real, well done man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#172 Leon Bisschops</font> pulled, big W. He also completed MKW advanced training with a 1:09 on LC, I feel like that time is starting to be the defining sub grind at the start of people's TT journey. He also got some other times but LC was the big one.<br><br><font color=yellow>#176 Chaos</font> started his journey to overtaking his namesake <font color=yellow>#118 Andrew Grieve</font> by completing his timesheet. Good luck in becoming the #1 chaos on the PP.<br><br><font color=yellow>#184 Kenneth Bernales</font> grinded out a 2:07 on DKM no glitch. Incredible job man, that track is not a friendly one to get into.<br><br><font color=yellow>#185 Blahpy</font> improved for the first time in almost 8 years, getting an mega epic 2:04.8 on rSL glitch as well as glitch flaps on both rSL and rPB.<br><br><font color=yellow>#192 Aaron M</font> played various flaps and got a nice omega on rSL ng flap.<br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#205 That DKJP kid</font> finally pulled through on his track, getting a 3/3 run and 6th WW.

Keep doing what makes you happy.<br><br><font color=yellow>#216 Darien Lupton</font> worked on his timesheet for a while and then begun the DKM glitch grind, going for 3/3 and possibly WW tops. Good luck bawpers!<br><br><font color=yellow>#239 Jeroen Schepers</font> asked me when the news update is coming out while I was out and I didn't actually make any spelling mistakes while responding, insane! He got GV no sc BNL tops early this month and then kept doing what he does best and trackhopped to improve his timesheet. Good job and good luck for next month!<br><br><font color=yellow>#273 Parker Johnson</font> cut 12 AF, could we see top 250 from him next month?<br><br><font color=yellow>#278 Brody Lassner</font> cut a MONUMENTAL 56.3594 AF, the biggest AF cut of the month. He also Loves the MGC 5x5 and 6x6. Amazing job, theCuber!<br><br><font color=yellow>#324 Kaiser Virtuoso</font> didn't post as many memes as last time and didn't get the same insane AF cut as last month, in fact, he only got one PR after the second day of January.

It's ok, rDH has broken many men before you. The WR is right there, let's hope he can clutch out a sick run, that track has so much left in it.

The man has shown interest in AF grinding so I bet we can expect a lot of fast progress from him soon. He is also getting really close to being the 3rd person to sub 1:09 on LC which is just god damn insane. Also he keeps getting MC3 PR's with bad l1s. Never Restart.<br><br><font color=yellow>#64 Bryce</font> Keeps asking for his monthly AF cut so here we go: It's -4.0000 this month! He also got a 2/3 glitch run on rSL getting him 2nd worldwide, and being the 4th person to get a 2/3 run. This got him a large lead on the total time stat, which he has used to torment me every day for a week.<br><br><font color=yellow>#99 JMM435</font> got a TF glitch flap which skyrocketed him to the top 100, absolutely mad.

Also there's no way I'm listing all of them so I'm just gonna just say 26.7 AF cut which is pretty huge.

249	Change, Confusion and COVID-19	<p><b>I'd like to start this news update by thanking Vega for all the work he's put into making the site as up to date as possible for the past 3 years. Live your life to the fullest, without worrying about numbers on screens. Godspeed, brother.<br><br>Me and Sosis will try our best to pick up the pieces and continue the work from here. Due to us having to learn to use the parser there might be a few mistakes in time updates, despite our attempts to avoid them. Please point out our fuckups. Thank you.<br><br>OK now that that's over with. Last time I did this update I was worrying about waking up in time for exams. Now, 3 weeks later I haven't left my house for more than 10 minutes at a time. My sleep schedule is so fucked that it's actually slowly turning back into a regular sleep schedule, just 24 hours later than normal. The world is fallen into a state of utter degeneracy and this has, naturally, increased MKW activity yay!! <br><br>Stay safe out there and avoid IRL interaction. It's easy for me to say this since I've basically trained for an event like this my whole life but doing this is essential to recover from this. Do your part.<br><br><br>OK, now that I'm done pretending like I know a thing about anything, let's get into the good stuff<br><br><br>This news update covers from March 5th 2020 to March 30th 2020<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime><br>OrangeYoshi (Bootleg YellowYoshi)<br>2ndmatt (There's like 5 Matts in this community what do you mean 2ndmatt)<br>CC Morton (MKW's finest egirl)<br>Alex Friedman (Alexander Alexandrovich Friedmann was a Russian and Soviet physicist and mathematician.)<br>William Wood (William Wood was a hardware manufacturer, ironmaster, and mintmaster, notorious for receiving a contract to strike an issue of Irish coinage from 1722 to 1724.)<br>Cosmo Solèr (Ron Swanson #1 fan)<br>Kingster (Your name is so boring I can't even make a joke out of it)<br></font><br><br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Justin Hitchcock</font>'s timesheet is too strong for him to get fast improvements. He did however get motivated by a man simply named DOGE to improve his DKJP flap. His rDH ng flap also got backrolled due to him using the banned ending strat (Whether or not that should be banned is a potential discussion to be had, but not this news update) so he improved that to a time that's very close to his old time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Thomas van Deerse</font> played some flaps for presumably AF related reasons. He's holding his ground like a champ and not going down without a fight. He should be able to maintain his 3rd place for a while if he plays this right things (hint hint TF glitch MG glitch).<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Arvo Koskikallio</font> only improves flaps. I finally got DDR 1:48 after over a month of playing on and off with an extremely anticlimactic run. I moved on from that to DKM, where I crushed my old flaps and got close to glitch flap WR, but didn't quite beat Logan the DKM goat. Oh yeah and I also slammed into a tree for over 10 hours for an MC glitch flap.<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Vincent Braixen</font> has been playing in the shadows, I haven't heard a single thing from him and now he suddenly has 1:58 on BC3 what. Also he bopped me off rDH glitch flap tops, unacceptable. Jokes aside, good job man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 AJ Rangthale</font> makes it into the top 10 for the first time. He conquered his fear of stupid categories and played some glitches, flaps and inconsistent garbage tracks. He also got the rDH ng WR after already giving up once and then picking it up again. Persistence. Great job, well deserved buddy. <br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Ross Coleman</font> is being worked to death due to him being an essential Iceland worker. All respect to you my dude. He's still got time to play some MKW tho, and he's currently gunning for SGB 1:21. Unfortunately he recently tested positive for no-sub disease and is now in recovery. I know how it feels, get well soon.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Oliver Luyckx</font> did what he usually does and came out of nowhere with an insane time, it was 1:47 on DKS this time. His run, iirc, was 2/3 jimmy with a 36.8 l3 so there is definitely potential for much more. It's crazy how nobody has got 1:46 in ages and the top 3 is just chilling in their own dimension on that track.<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Jake Harrison</font> got a couple of PRs and is slowly but surely ascending the rankings. Top 15 soon, ey?<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Ruby Aruba</font> improved his times on rBC and rMR but still lost over half of an AF point. I guess he didn't improve by much.<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> entered the state of not getting anything after playing disgusting categories (MMM, DDR). We've all been there, hope you find a nice track to play soon :)<br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Vincent Nguyen</font> is this months god gamer supreme. Holy shit.<br><br>AF cut: -38.9219<br>Position cut: -30 (#58-#28)<br>PR count: 30<br><br>Biggest AF cut of the month and he was already on the top 60 at the start of March. Major props you absolute legend.<br><br><font color=yellow>#31 Dane Allen</font> set a few nice PR's this month, including subbing 1:36 on rDH by a hair. He's also probably been doing mogi like a madman but I wouldn't know. Someone get me an unban please I won't break the rules (I will probably break the rules)<br><br><font color=yellow>#39 Carter Clem</font> subbed 1:50 on DDR this month. Congrats man, DDR subs aren't fun.<br><br><font color=yellow>#44 Caleb House</font> kept up the LC grind this month, reaching 8th WW on there. Mad stuff. He now has WW tops on 4 out of the 6 spear tracks (Although Ross would probably say there are over 16 spear tracks in MKW).<br><br><font color=yellow>#48 Indy Kambeitz</font> got 17 PR's this month, bopping WiiLord95, the god of MKW in the process. Good stuff man, duck squad 4life xdD<br><br><font color=yellow>#49 Luke Brown</font> i have waited so long for this.<br><br>4c756b6520636f6d706c65746564206869732074696d65736865657420627920706c6179696e6720612062756e6368206f6620666c6170732e<br><br>486520646964206e6f74207365656d20746f20656e6a6f7920746865204146206772696e64696e67206c6966657374796c652e<br><br>486520616c736f206265617420466f78277320544620666c61702057522c206d656e74616c2e<br><br>48652066696e616c6c7920676f74204b432057522074686973206d6f6e74682061667465722061206c6f6e67206772696e642e<br><br>4576656e20616476616e6365642041492067657420737475636b20636f6d706c6574696e6720646966666963756c74207461736b732e<br><br>476f6f64206a6f62204c756b6520616e6420616e796f6e652077686f2068616420746865206566666f727420746f20636f6e7665727420746869732e<br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#59 Filler</font>'s disc wasn't feeling very good this month so he had to resort to playing on ISO and, after me pointing out MKL's policy, streaming. He did MG WW top attempts and of course, got them in less than 2 hours. How. He also got a nice MC3 time before his disc was violently gunned down.<br><br><font color=yellow>#61 Bryce</font> -5.4531. He also finally got the sub 21 on MG (20.5 :O) after a long and painful grind. Massive congrats, crazy stuff.<br><br><font color=yellow>#95 JMM435</font> returned to his natural ways of improving his Portuguese records. He also got another MT 2/3 glitch run, this time a much better one. Keep up the quality Portuguese gaming.<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#108 Logan BbirbPog</font> finally got TF glitch 1:44 after stalling for weeks! Congrats. He's also been grinding no glitch there and is showing potential for a .3, maybe even WR. Luke might have something to say to this, though.<br><br><font color=yellow>#111 Jordan Artz</font> aka Murabito improved his BCWii glitch time, inching towards the 2:09. Good luck!<br><br><font color=yellow>#116 Darragh J</font> made an insane comeback with a 2nd WW time on rSGB, what a legend. Good luck if you decide to go for WR there!<br><br><font color=yellow>#117 Shane Hogan</font> completed his timesheet and is apparently going to unhoard later today and get close to top 100. Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#123 Stacy Needham</font> played??? He got a SGB flap PR. Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#129 Tom Norton</font> continued to broadcast his mental breakdowns to the tune of Luigi Circuit. He overcame the track and got a solid 6th WW time there. Let's go man, good luck for any further sessions.<br><br><font color=yellow>#140 Chaos</font> got a ton of PR's as always, cutting 17 positions this month. Keep it up!<br><br><font color=yellow>#158 Shawn Berry</font> improved rMR i think<br><br><font color=yellow>#160 Blake Germany</font> has been streaming stuff and he improved his flap WR? on DKS. Also the feds are coming to sieze your savegame.<br><br><font color=yellow>#168 Leon Bisschops</font> got a ton of PR's again and cut 7.5 AF (but only 2 positions :().<br><br><font color=yellow>#175 Aaron M</font> kept up the good work. Keep up the good work!<br><br><font color=yellow>#177 That DKJP kid</font> has been grinding loads of tracks and cut climbs down the rankings faster than almost anyone. Go go.<br><br><font color=yellow>#178 Atisha Ribeiro</font> completed his timesheet. Will we ever know what loaf is? Nobody can tell.<br><br><font color=yellow>#190 Kenneth Bernales</font> improved his times on GV and rPG. I just realised he is the epitome of anti-glitching, he doesn't have a single glitch time. If you like free AF I have a recommendation for you.<br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#201 Daniel B</font> was not going to take getting knocked off BCWii WW tops well. He gained them back almost instantly, epic. Please go for 2:09 there or you will be tormented with an eternal sub curse again.<br><br><font color=yellow>#209 The Intellectual Pear</font> does not know the proper time submission formatting. Please learn the proper time submission formatting. Good job on the rather large AF cut though.<br><br><font color=yellow>#214 Kjeld van Keulen</font> continued his gaming, it's not the 2010's anymore so he is allowed to play MKW now. Good stuff.<br><br><font color=yellow>#221 Darien Lupton</font> cut AF but lost 4 positions due to new players. GGs.<br><br><font color=yellow>#223 Jeroen Schepers</font> cut over 14 AF but stayed at #223.

250	Alex Penev appreciation post	<p><b>To start this news update off I'm once again gonna shoutout a legend. Penev came back with a bang to make edits to the site, we now have 3lap only no glitch AF charts for all our glitchphobic and flapaphobic comrades and, more interestingly we can now link videos to times! We are truly living in the future. <br><br>However, adding videos is extremely time-consuming for existing times, they need to be resubmitted into the database with the video attached to them. If anyone is interested in helping out, you can submit existing times and add videos. The times don't have to be your own, as long as you enter the right date and use the right format, I can just run the parser and go through them very fast. (Having videos for WRs would be awesome, for example) Help out if you want, it will be much appreciated.<br><br><br>Ok now that I've tried to make the community do the work that I'm supposed to be doing lets actually write the news update<br><br><br><br>So what happened this month? Well, quite a lot I think. <br><br>Firstly, we got 17 WRs so far thanks to quarantine MKW, stay inside and nolife TTs to save the world boys<br><br>Amaya's large wallet started a Rainbow Road glitch bounty which is currently at $465 for the 3lap WR. The longer it takes the higher the chances are that people are going to disappear and not pay up. So hurry gamers.<br><br>The community collectively ganged up on Blaze for not providing sufficient proof and we peer pressured him to share his BKS' (GV2 excluded because the track is too scary for Blaze). Blaze did redeem himself by getting a WR on MG but his Wii U was unfortunately denied access to the CTGP database by the isolationist Idahoan regime. He also got bulldozed by LUKE-GB-2000 shortly after, F's in the chat<br><br>TroyWD gave Eminem the D??? Why is everyone talking about this? Slim Shady is not even real he is just a character played by Marshall Mathers (eminems real name) so what people are saying???<br><br>rDH 1:30, MG 1:40 and GV 15 are all getting closer and closer to becoming reality, we live in a crazy world<br><br>BIG CHEESE MISSED DKM SUB 2 NO<br><br>And the big surprise of the month, the absolute legend SpitFire aka FMSD Cole redeemed himself after over 4 years and came back with a new DKM glitch PR on CTGP. This makes his old pending time valid, making him a former WR holder and adding salt to TWD's wounds.<br><br><br>Quote of the month:<br><br>You have to pull through the shit sessions, that's what makes or breaks the gamer.<br>- //Ross Coleman//<br><br><br>Also Bynt asked me to talk about his inspirational rPB 1:12 grind in the news update but I'm gonna say he sucks at Sunset Forest instead LMAO get owned kid<br><br><br>ok i think i angered quite a few people there so lets stop writing and do some stats<br><br><br>This news update covers from April 1st 2020 to April 30th 2020 although the stats program is 2 days behind so im gonna fail to mention some stuff GGs<br><br><br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime><br>Railz (the letter Z in your username is like wearing eyeliner IRL)<br>Nathan Brammer (Replaces Flamin Funky as the #1 Nathan of the community after Nate was gunned down by Bryce and the youtube-mp4 gang)<br>Mitchell Healy (I hate that Gru profile picture)<br>ZappZ (Two letter Z's in your username is like injecting eyeliner into your bloodstream, Trump is considering this as a cure to COVID-19)<br>Simon Dube (is it pronunced Dube or Dubé)<br>C.J.

Starting off on MC he got 3rd WW on ng and 4th on g. He also joined Caleb in the 24flap gang, very nice. Towards the end of the month he played rWS, knocking off my boy Jawdyn (irrelevant player) from the tops. He played MG ng, getting very close to WR. We'll see what this madman does next month.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Martin Fox</font>. I haven't been able to write that name since I took over, but this month he decided to drop Shifty Shafts and bounce off a few pipes to reclaim his treasured Nordic Record (most relevant record in MKW).

I finished my DKM grind reaching all my goals there and the proceeded to only improve flaps for the rest of the month. MH PR is on the way though.

I called him bad on rDH flap and got decimated. Fuck. He got to hold WR on rDH for a while but everyone's been playing that so it didn't last very long.

He managed to reclaim WR there but ended up getting involved in a global conflict against the Yankee Doodle gang which ended up in Braixen swooping the WR, David struck back hard with a lucky glitch run, sadly he thought that drifting after the glitch would be slower, this misjudgement lost him a lot of time, but he still managed to clutch out a big WR cut. Unfortunately the Yanks followed back with another successful strike from Glitch O, which forced David to move on to GV2, getting a 52.8 there with a clutch lap 3. Luckily for David however, Logan is once again stalling the sub and David has a chance to strike again at a later date. Oh yeah and he got 2 rYF WRs aswell but rDH was more exiting to talk about<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 AJ Rangthale</font> has been chillin and grinding away, he started off the month with a bang, with a 1:09.050 on LC, a third 1:08 is on the way, could it be big Sosis who gets it? Lately he's needed a breather from the monotony of spear and moved over to rWS for some action. He's at a .0 there aswell, very close to the big 1:49. Will he prosper? Will he crumble? Yes.<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Ross Coleman</font> in classic Ross Coleman fashion has not set a PR with any other vehicle than the spear this month. He's set PR's on rSGB, rPG and of course MG, the #1 spear track in MKW. He's also been spending his afternoons trying to acquire money by trying to fly in space and avoid the evil cloud man with a U-turn sign like the greedy capitalist he is. GV glitch has also been a recent addition to his roster of tracks since you get to play with a child on that one.<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Jake Harrison</font> has been a little quiet this month but apparently he set a time on MG no glitch today! Hope you're doing well dude, keep up the essential worker routine and dodge the COVID dudes<br><br><font color=yellow>#19 Wincent Nguyen</font> has been playing a lot of amazing categories such as rSGB glitch flap and CM glitch flap which I'm now going to leak my reaction to:<br><br>Arvo25/04/2020<br>lkjdsaLUJHFSDAOJKFHBFKGL<br>:angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry:<br><br>He cut another 15 AF and keeps climbing the charts like a beast and strikes fear in the heart of every gamer. <br>He will beat you.

After a lot of moving around and achieving many things here and there he finally found his place on an active war zone atoll called Shy Guy Beach. Even though the Shy Guys try their best to slow him down he is determined to overcome his curse and hit that 1:21. Good luck yankee doodle gang member.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 JoshuaMK</font> avoided his mother's rule and sneaked away to play MKW for once, setting new times on LC 3lap and flap. He will forever be remembered as the pioneer who implemented LC ramp into the flaps at a high level. Sadly he had to go on a spontanious road trip again and we haven't heard from him since.

Congratulations on your achievement, the grind has been wild. The former record was 148 by TWD98, lasting a mind-boggling 6,806 days. he also played flaps or something and got 1:41 on mg but the N-word record was the main thing he was hyped for this month.<br><br><font color=yellow>#30 Daseia</font> provoked another wiimmfi gang war against GUN gang by forgetting to not pick Toad's Factory 10 times in a row by total accident.

Inspirational.<br><br><font color=yellow>#39 Carter Clem</font> played some good old LC to start, and then did what he always does, trackhopping around and getting runs.

His goal is now a 1:40 which is just insane. Another insane time he got was a 1:09.443 on LC with the Bowser Bike, just destroying the alternative tops and making Jeff and Liam look like a bunch of fools. His best splits give a 1:09.2.

He overtook the lord WiiLord95, an act that is extremely frowned upon in most civilized societies.

Bottom line, this is unacceptable.<br><br><font color=yellow>#57 Filler</font>'s disc decided to die which forced him to play on ISO. Playing off CTGP seemed to work out for him, and his activity has severely decreased once he started playing on CTGP again. Hmmmmmmmm. Where have we seen this before????

He got a very glitch reliant rSL run (because he's slow at driving the course) and foolishly attempted to claim the MC glitch European Record from the hands of Ethan Hedley. This did not end well, since Ethan sensed his flawlessly driven ER being threatened and easily blew JMM away.

With Liam playing MH the WR there is surely going to fall soon. (Just fuck him 2.0?) He also casually made DKJP 3/3 and then improved it on the same day, that the hell Justin. He was also the first one to implement the new DKJP flap shroomstrat in a WR. The shroom was originally found by Idriz I think.

Good job Sosis!<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Nick Meade</font> has been going in on DKS and CM glitch, securing himself in the top 10 for a while longer.

Ross has also been grinding rSL 2/3 to reclaim his WR but he's not quite got it yet. It'll happen soon brotha. He also almost killed himself by playing DKJP flap with the new strats but he somehow lived to tell the tale. Best of luck in recovering from this traumatic experience.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Vincent Nguyen</font> climbed another 5 spots this month, this dude's gonna be top 10 soon at this rate. He did AF grinding managing to get a 1:31 on rMC as well as the CM glitch 33 as well as a lot of other times. <br><br><font color=yellow>#15 Daseia</font> got another 36 PRs and climbing 15 positions this month.

He got extremely close to WR there but the final stretch is always the hardest. He also got L1 bks that was unfortunately KIA during a mass ghost deletion and the ghost never found it's way onto the CTGP database. Dennis Colvin 2.0????<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 MKRFirestone</font> has been on the grind for making the hard glitches, which has cut him a lot of AF in the process. He even managed to get a SGB glitch flap, what a legend.

The race to sub 1 is on, this might be the last minute sub on MKW. Me and Ross already peer pressured Jacob to use Lucky Soul - Lips Are Unhappy as the bgm in case he gets it. If someone else gets it but doesn't use that song I'm going to cry myself to sleep for a week. Jacob also got the 1:21 on rSGB after many years of being stuck at .0, amazing stuff this month mate :)<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Stavros Ferentinos</font> played some rWS this month aswell, he did have a really nice pace until he decided to hit the mud at the end of l3.

Proud American!<br><br><font color=yellow>#44 Luke Brown</font> has been going in on MG and also started getting really sick laps on rDS so quickly, BKS could realistically be pushed to 2:03 now which sounds crazy. He also did some AF grinding, getting a first try 4.3 CM glitch flap, how. Unfortunately though, Luke was exposed by Colin The Mega Mushroom for using controller modifications so all his runs are now invalid that is so very unfortunate... <br><br><font color=yellow>#45 Trung Qatar</font> was suspected of being an alt for so many years but he resurfaced in the German community recently and joined the PP. His times were crazy good for his time, glad to see him finally make contact with the community and maybe make a comeback on CTGP??  ;)<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Hunter Wells</font> posted a very disturbing image of a chicken in a TT server which I can't stop seeing in my brain every time I see Hunter speak why man. Let's get through this quick, Hunter improved some of his weaker times but also got a 37 flap on BC3 sc and a 2:17 3lap on no-sc. He's currently going for 1:58 on sc, good luck cowboy!<br><br><font color=yellow>#50 Indy Kambeitz</font> is hanging onto top 50 until last breath. He improved on TF and then a ton of no-sc categories so the stats program only shows one improvement. Bruh. He is not 40th on the red charts so it was probably worth.<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#53 Cole Gilbert</font>'s insane rPB comeback shook the whole community, how the hell did you skip .8 and went straight to .7???? Cole said he's also got plans to grind rPB to maybe even .6, which would be incredible to see. Good luck Cole, you've got it takes.<br><br><font color=yellow>#56 Bryce</font> has been grinding very hard for DKJP glitch WR, failing tons of really good runs on the 3rd glitch. That has to go down soon with Bryce (and the Duck Squad children) grinding it. He also got the flap BKT on DKJP but he wasnt really trying tho :blush:<br>Oh yeah and he found the nosc flap shroomspot, thanks for the 2 day flap BKT mate<br><br><font color=yellow>#61 JMM435</font> went on a bit of a tear, improving his GV glitch time as well as getting a 2/3 on DKJP with orgasmic digits. Speaking of orgasmic digits he also got a 53.000 on GV2 glitch. How do you do this man that is so cool. Oh yeah and he also climbed 30 spots on the rankings what the hell epic, top 50 soon??<br><br><font color=yellow>#65 Takeo</font> has been trackhopping again and cut 21 positions from last month.

He never saw it coming. He's been trackhopping a ton and cut 13.5 AF, making the combined top 100. Good going man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#95 ZJ Insanity</font> the wii wheel god managed to get a couple of PR's after a while of not doing much TTs. 2:12 on BCWii sticks out, good shit man.<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#105 Shane Hogan</font> has not been doing his homework on the time submission format, if he posts one more bad submission he's getting blocked. Ok for real he got a pretty nice 1/3 time on rDKJP glitch, showing me and ross who's boss. Keep it up, you could 2/3 for sure. <br><br><font color=yellow>#106 Logan BbirbPog</font> got a 2/3 on DKJP what i didnt even see that, nice. He also got WW tops on BC3 and is now pushing for a sick WGM glitch run after being bested by the blithering Japanese idiot.<br><br><font color=yellow>#107 Benjamin Zenon</font> did actually improve on rWS this month wow. Good shit<br><br><font color=yellow>#109 Chaos</font> has finally passed the other chaos and is now officially the #1 ranked chaos on the PP.

Respect to the man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#130 Joe Coppernoll</font> the og made a comeback this month with a new rYF flap PR.

He cut 36 spots this month and entered the top 150 and has surprisingly picked up MC tas glitch now. You could get a pretty decent run there with enough grinding for sure. Good luck in whatever you decide to play next!<br><br><font color=yellow>#150 Leon Bisschops</font> also managed to get into the top 150 this month! Somehow he climbed 7 spots by LOSING AF?? Inspirational. Go get that 1:57 on CM!<br><br><font color=yellow>#160 Shawn Berry</font> has consistently zoomed his youtube pfp for years now.

He got to #69 but got cucked by Mr. Logan Paul. It's not all bad, now you can be #69 twice! He gave some nice comments about his times again:<br><br>rDKM g 2:07.169 / 39.387 - I couldn't believe I was able to finish this despite how nervous I was.

Well NateSM came back to RR and already failed 2:31's so again couldn't let him bop me. Splits were 50.391 / 50.100, pbs / 50.678 [nerves]. I can def get a mid 2:30 and I personally want to grind this again now because back then I wasn't consistent with some of the strats (ex: the zipper after cannon, but I can do this like 100% now lol). My long term goal for this track is a 2:29 with bike and I think i'm more than capable of hitting it if I grinded for ages.<br><br>rDKJP no glitch 2:15.440  - This was a easy high 2:14 pace but then I pulled a Luke Brown L3 and went into the grass and still managed to PR. I want to focus on RR now (for obvious reason cough cough natesm cough cough) then I'll make sure to return here.<br><br>rGV2 g flap 15.181 - alright run but I could take alot more turns more tighter. The only reason I cut off more than .1 is bc my former PR was done with classic while my GCN was broken at the time. sadly i lost to the portugese world flap record by .001 (jmm) on gv2 flap<br><br>rSL no glitch 2:06.154 - Decided to play this last night because I got bored and PRed here 3 times (451, 383, 154). I set the 451 and 383 overnight then got the 154 in the afternoon. Anyway L1 was average for me, L2 was complete dogshit and L3 was a pbs for me  (splits were 42.053, 42.260, 41.841). I really want 2:05 before stopping, which I'm capable of. Ill get it soon™️<br><br>MMM 1:17.136 - I consider this a 1:16 fail bc I got caught in 2 mole trails after making low trick L3. I'll join 1:16 gang soon.<br><br>MC g 1:08.662 - I hit the goomba L1 and got my 1st 3/3 with it.

What happened this month?<br><br>MH had a new consistent MT strat which lead to Justin finally getting MH WR after changing the way he plays the track for the 69th time. This lead to Luke gaining honorary status within team KNFE after some questionable comments concerning homicidal desires towards a famous member of the community who is very versed in the art of sending phallic imagery to individuals. Justin also improved his first WR by 1 millisecond afterwards to assert dominance.<br><br>Luke, however was not done there and redeemed himself and pulled the most boomer move imaginable, beating Justin's WR without the MT strat. This only increased Justin's descent into memes and legend says he is currently attempting Cock Island WR for at least 5 hours per day.<br><br>Sosis finally pulling through another one of his marathon WR grinds, this time bopping Jascha on rMR. Jascha is now WRless for the first time since 1 March 2009, having held at least one WR for over 11 years. Congrats Sosis!<br><br>Jared got GV no-sc WR and 2:08 (on waluigi stadium) and has been doing his mod duties superbly on the public TT discord which, naturally is a conversation platform for only the wisest and most intellectual individuals. Congratulations for all your achievements this month!<br><br>Connor from twd98 got the Mushroom Gorge ng WR with a clutch as hell lap 3. Since the Player's Page has publicly renounced the former WR holder, I am unable to disclose any information about him. We proudly wish death upon mkwrs, mkleaderboards and most of all the illegitimate state of Israel<br><br>The President of The United States is diagnosed with a deadly disease and everybody is happy about it, this feels like an opening to a terrible war movie<br><br>Fucking dumbass Victor Alicea made up times again and was booted off the rankings.

He pushed rWS to a 1:48, got MC 48 with his new treeless treeclip, beat the WGM ng flap WR by a single millisecond (i hate justin), rWS ng flap WR (oldest flap WR bopped by a new shroomstrat smh... also Totom's last WR is rip) killed and resurrected rBC glitch flap in a single week and, most importantly, challenged the rSGB glitch flap king Jack Gluesing with a new TAS glitch flap.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Logan BbirbPog</font> made his way up to #2 this month after grinding a few flaps and also improved like every red chart category to reach top 5 over there aswell, pretty pogchamp. He also pushed DC really far, getting 3rd WW over there. And he got 48.3 on MC glitch with the new strat ofc. Next up, rBC glitch. Just remember to not shroom late!!!<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 BTEC Logan</font> copied logan and also played Daisy Circuit, god try to be a little original at least...

After this, however he was caught off guard by a pesky man simply named Justin trying to contend his title of the unquestioned champion on the greatest category in the game. Jack got straight to business, beating Justin's run relatively soon with a 17.0 but wasn't satisfied. He decided he wanted more. 16 was in sight and it could not slip away now. He waited and waited for the bombs and eventually got the god run, subbing 17 and proving to Justin that he is nothing compared to Jack G. He would not be intimidated on his track ever again. <br><br>and then he got another 16.9 but faster what the actual hell<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#13 AJ Rangthale</font> casually popped up again with a 2nd WW run on GV2 ng. Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Ross Coleman</font> abandoned his principles and only played non-spear tracks for the entire month, getting some PBs on tracks such as rBC, BC and rWS, probably due to playing online TTs too much and always losing on these tracks! He also improved his time on CM ng deeper into the 1:56 territory. <br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Jake Harrison</font> is still so god damn loud god i never want to call with him again. He improved on BCWii as well as rBC this month.<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Nils Stoffers</font> got a bunch of times this month but his big focus seemed to have been rYF and he almost knocked me off regionals 30 minutes after I set my time but was barely slower.

This is not good I hope you recover from this. Although thanks to his depression he could ignore all worldly responsibilities and focus 100% on Time Trials. Chaos (identity exposed) has been hard at work trying to cover up his ugly history of using anime miis for personal records.

MG is under a quarter of a second of my best splits. and gv2 is about .07 off my best splits. TF is a different story.

Goal is to beat 49.644 aka Kevin Borne's PB.<br><br>"But why that guy?" you may ask... Well, he is an old Site Champion from 2008, but also the "worst" good French player. He has a red AF of ~180 and he's 8th French, I'm 9th w/ 306 AF so yeah pretty big gap separating bad and better players. And my goal is to beat him and be one of those better players. Ratio is 3/64 wins for now, it'll be quite the journey and I'm not 100% sure I'll beat him before 2022 tbh. But hey, having a goal is cool it lets you think you have something to do in your life I guess That was really too long I'm sorry if you're reading this I always comment with like 69420 words lmao<br><br><br>TF (No-SC) Flap: 35.352<br>LEGEND TIME BOIIIIIIII<br>Not only this time is the first Legend Standard I ever had, but it's also the first Legend... C Standard. Skipped LD Cheesy Also it may be in the top 10 French? It is on the PP (it's 9th), but idk if there's any time that beats this outside of the site. People just don't run Flap lmao<br>The run itself was really clean, with a nice entry to the flap, clean driving for my standards, and had a low trick (kinda? I can't tell lmao) at the end. The run I was looking for, even though I did not believe I could set it... Well I'm glad I was wrong X)<br><br>MH: 1:45.299<br>I'VE RETURNED TO MY HOME TRACK AND PB'D DAY 1 YESSSSSSSS<br>Ahem... Yes, I have a pretty cool history with this track actually. But I'm not talking about this today. Let's analyse the run. It was what I was looking for. PBS lap 1 and very good lap 3 (also PBS but I have like 3 of them so yeah...), only lap 2 is a bit weak but it's still better than my average this session. I think this could've been a King B (sub 1:45.1) if I actually TRICKED WHEN I GOT A PERFECT DOUBLE TRICK OCCASION LAP 2 HOW DID I MISS IT. Anyway, this is good for my standards and my current strategies as well I think (there are many things I don't do, you'll see by yourself) and I definitely won't give this another shot until 2021.<br>Oh, and IT BEATS KEVIN BORNE YES (8th French and I'm 9th if you want to know). It's still only a 5/59 win ratio between us, but hey, a win is a win.<br>(Yes it was copied from the video's description. I mean, it's what I have to say about the run so idk why it would be diffrent)<br><br>He really has a big rivalry with Kevin Borne, keep up the grind and the in depth essays :)<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#304 Jesus "Mango" Christ</font> hates spiders.

He got 1:29.3 on DC, low 1:18.1 on MC3, a casual 2:16.6 MT turnskip run as well as a bunch of other stuff. but he eventually looked at his statistic and found a horrifying truth which hindered his gaming session and caused deep mental trauma.<br><br>JustinToday at 00:23<br>I lost a wr to troy<br><br>hopefully you recover.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Logan BbirbPog</font> started the month off with his TF WRs and afterwards got not only the rBC 3lap glitch WR, <u>but also the flap WR with a 32"459</u>.

After the new year he fixed his dirty ways and stopped playing glitches, good job on your reformation.<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Jack Gluesing</font> is back in the top 10 and improved on too many tracks to mention, the big ones definitely being LC 1:09.200 and MMM 1:15.959 at the start of the new year.

Go nick and please make MT TT lab good, there are so many people who can't play MT (Ross, David and Thomas to name a few).<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Jay Rangthale</font> has started another one of his grinds that will take him onto the depths of human phyche. All to dethrone Blaze on his final WR track. One leaks, the other one hoards, but who will be victorious at the end? We will see.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Ross Coleman</font> got a small TF glitch improvement with his new strat but leaked it to the world for the greater good so Logan could strengthen his WR and finally beat Luke in WR count. After this good deed he went forward with small improvements across the board. 2:18.3 on MT aswell, perhaps I treated you harshly by grouping you with David and Thomas on this track.<br><br><font color=yellow>#15 Jake Harrison</font> bopped me on rWS for the glory of the great white north. I had the (dis)pleasure of hearing this man's voice once again and he instantly reminded me of why I had not called with him after his screech reached 140 dB and has permanently reduced my ability to listen to nightcore.

This lead to a new DC flap WR of 28.168, a time that, I trust will last for a long time since nobody in their right mind can handle this category for longer than 10 minutes.<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Takeo</font> went in hard this month with a 23.5 AF cut and cutting over 20 positions. Too many tracks to mention but to me SGB 18 seconds stands out!!!!! it's an honour to have you on the greatest top 10 known to man. also 38.8 rDS flap how do you randomly get these great flaps (thinking back to DKJP)<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> finally reached #2 on the red charts, awesome stuff man, ultra deserved.

Also some other PRs probably due to online TT practice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#41 Luke Brown</font> improved his rBC WR as said before and he also tied it after with a new BKS of 50.095 on L3.

Also MMM 1:16.5 and 23 flap is pretty damn epic. His anti-anime grind continues and he has already messaged me of another improvement that covers up his anime mii phase.<br><br><font color=yellow>#49 Hunter Wells</font> had one of the stupidest and the most obscure WR fails I've ever seen in my life, he made the rWS glitch without shrooming on the backwards hop and used his 3rd shroom in the air after the ramp l1???

260	News update to celebrate Joe Weller's Birthday	<p>tw / making fun of trigger warnings, which is deeply hurtful and disregards people that have gone through traumatic events<br><br>This news update is sponsored by the beautiful view of the Finnish countryside out of my window:<br><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/264165050179256321/816288220631400488/Snapchat-2107026975.jpg?width=314&height=558"></img><br><br><br><b>hey guys its troy here<br><br>I'm gonna write this over a couple of days this time so this will probably exclude some of the stuff that happened a few days prior me releasing this. But yeah, so many things have happened and this will probably take like 8 hours to write so I'm just gonna get right into it, let's recap<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>ARTHUR MKW MADE HISTORY, he made RR glitch literally about 5 minutes after my last news update which is why that wasn't mentioned. Really happy to see it happen and super proud of the community for showering with kindness (and dollar dollar bills)<br><br>New glitch on KC happened just yesterday when I'm writing this, Justin proved all the haters wrong and made it super fast. Grats to Justin and can't wait to see others make it in the future too. (Also new glitch category on the PP, marking everything as no glitch is getting stupid)<br><br>Jack Gluesing (hero) improved his rSGB glitch flap WR by a single millisecond, once again showing everyone the glorious SGB glitch way of life. Mad props.<br><br>The king of the PP Paul Allain received a Player of The Week award for improving his entire timesheet in a week. Historic moment y'all<br><br>Bryce goτ rξkT once again with yet another Jacob "The DKJP Kid" Invincible Mario MK Ejaycob B Loerzel Jacob DKJP Glitch WR, lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br><br>Justin (I hate him) achieved pizza delivery with his new DDR WR, but there's still a while to go to beat the actual WR by Blackyboi<br><br>rPG technically faster flap glitch is not also faster in practice thanks to Alex King and his immaculate wheelieturns<br><br>Logan is stalling on the WGM 31 (classic) and the race to the sub between him, McRaren and new challenger Ray is proving to be a fun one to watch. Stay tuned folks (UPDATE: LOGAN HACKED MY COMPUTER AND UNHOARDED HIS 31.8 TO MAKE ME WRITE EXTRA SENTENCES FOR THE NEWS UPDATE FUCK YOU LOGAN)<br><br>Luke did some really insane work on his own WRs this month, pushing rBC and rMC to unimaginable levels. As much as he is now tied with Logan for the most WRs (hahahahahahahaha fraud gb), some of his WRs are going to stay until the end of fucking time.<br><br>Logan bullies small children and takes their rWS glitch WRs. This will not be tolerated in this community, as we have a zero tolerance bullying policy and will be banning Logan from all competitions until further notice (serves him right, he's a big nerd and looks gay)<br><br>des (lowercase d because he has a small D) finally reclaimed his MC WR after a silent grind, but once again speed-bully Logan stole des' hard earnt record. Shameful.<br><br>Benny pulled off the first ever MT 3/3 run with his batshit inside the ground strategy. He got like a 1:54 but there's potential for some big moves on there<br><br>I saw Luke getting a 1:46.6 on DDR but I'm pretty sure that's just a dream I had last night<br><br>Niyake is the most undisputed among the undisputed kings of a track, finally pulling through and getting a 15 second time on GV. He said 14 will be hard. I think I agree with Niyake on this one.<br><br>Sosis (NO RUBER) dethroned Blaze on GV2, completing another one of his monster grinds and knocking Blaze to 0 WRs (5 if you count the ones he's hoarding)<br><br>Nao just got KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR<br><br>Oh yeah new summoning salt video was quite epic, had to drop everything to watch that on my TV in the dark. Felt like watching a fully fledged documentary, props to all who contributed<br><br>Volpe admitted to cheating and got removed from the PP that's a king sized XXL bruh moment<br><br>Vincent Brakekekekekekekekeken (12 years old) stole Luke's hard earnt MH WR in predatory fashion. This is so sad, can we please subscribe to lukegb on twitch.<br><br>Speaking of things of a predatory fashion, James Charles got caught sending nudes to children again, bad influence from the MKW community I see<br><br>Even more predatory-related news, Creepyproduce unlisted his nonce videos lol, I'll put the links here and check on them here and there to see when they get deleted so I can reupload them:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYrv-15JRLw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYrv-15JRLw</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a> (this one's a rickroll, I don't recommend clicking on it)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQN0ZwlJSXk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQN0ZwlJSXk</a><br><br><br>if he gets lounge unbanned before me im leaving the community forever and deleting everybody's timesheets on the PP as well as MKLeaderboards<br><br><br>Quote of the month:<br><br>Eat a dick, Luke.

He smoked some Happy Hippo™ Kratom and wondered to himself how epic it would be if the Rapide (yes, rapide gang, fuck zip zip that shit cringe) was faster on DKJP. And then it was. He also thought KC glitch should be RTA-viable, and then that dream was real also. THEN HE ALSO MADE THE KC GLITCH RTA AND GOT WR calm the fuck down Justin!!!! Also DDR wr gg ez Fraud_GB destroyed once again (I hate justin for this).<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Logan bBirbPog</font> Logan's month consisted of a ton of WRs that I already mentioned as well as a 1:57.9 on BC3 g and a 2:16.8 on ng. He also got a 33.562 DDR flap! Congrats Logan!<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Vincent Braixen</font> stole Luke's hard earnt MH WR and is grounded for three weeks. And today is punishment day.<br><br>First punishment: Running him over with my car<br>Second punishment: Watching JordanTheVyonder2002 Productions for 24 hours<br>Third punishment: Calling with Jake Harrison on max volume for 3 hours<br>Fourth punishment: Death.<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Arvo Koskikallio</font> got his 11th WW 58 time on rYF (life is a pointless void but at least i got the sexiest sub in this game) as well as an unsatisfactory flap PR with a drop at the end. Towards the end of February my mental state begun to deteriorate so badly that I switched over to the heavenly bliss of rSGB TAS glitch to escape the constant pain of missing the stick every lap. It paid off and I had a fun time writing job applications while playing MKW.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 Thomas van Deerse</font> took a break from the normal life and returned to the pits of hell on rWS ng flap. He managed a 35.4 (which is 3rd place iirc) pretty fast which is very nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 David Morton</font> bald cunt retard pussy crybaby bastard nonce never updating your prs let sam do it. UPDATE: Sam did it. David got some epic PRs like MMM 1:15 (apparently bad according to david). He also got rPG 1:59 (no he didnt LOL) as well as a BC3 3/3 ultra (again, keep dreaming bro). For real he got magi BKT on rSL which is pretty nice (still a bad run according to david)<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Zed R</font> got frightened by the powers of Jack Gluesing and Vincent Nguyen and realised he needs to defend the honour of the Fatherland and remain on the top 10 til the end. He played a metric fuckton of categories and got so many PRs, maybe the coolest ones being a TF 1/3 1:47.6 and a new rMC 1:31.4. Keep up the fight mate.<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Jack Gluesing</font> the quintessential MKW madlad achieved the following things this month:<br><br>- 2:18 KC<br>- A legendary 1 millisecond improvement on heavenly waiting game category<br>- Addiction to MH leading to a 1:43.6 and a 33.0 flap<br>- 1:59 rPG<br>- Joining the discord server and abandoning his mystery man status<br>- And so much more<br><br><br><font color=red>Permavirgins</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#11 Vincent Nguyen</font> begun his month with a slick 1:33.2 on rDH sc and moved onto DC where he got a sub (1:31 sub) with a time of 1:30.005. After this he once again did some soul searching and discovered himself to be going full steam ahead on GV2, achieving both 3lap ng WW tops <u>as well as a new glitch flap WR with a time of 13.574</u>!<br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Nick Meade</font> got himself new CM ng 3lap and flap times as well as a 1:18.3 on MC3. He also managed made another great WR recap video which I tried to watch while falling asleep, it was a very hypnotic experience.<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Jay Rangthale</font> had unprotected (NO RUBER) intercourse with GV2 until he came all over its pretty face and achieved a new WR. After this he picked up rMC and got a 1:31.0 and is already getting WR splits. He's gonna play this shit for like 5 months isn't he.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Ross Coleman</font> got a 1:33.8 rDH 3/3 run WHICH LOSES TO TROY LMAO LMAO LMAO THIS IS SO FUNNY you are very shit! He did also get 1:56.4 CM and a 2:04.2 rSL (not quite Arjun tier but still rather epic). He also flexed his quirky spear abilities (he's not like other boys, he prefers speed over drift) on rDH and got a 1:35.4 as well as leeching off Justin's KC glitch run with a pair of fresh new shroomless spear BKS' (these were beaten by Braixen and ross is currently contemplating suicide in the TT chat, F)<br><br><font color=yellow>#15 Jake Harrison</font> beat jery on MH with his very own 1:43.6. He also hopped on GV2 glitch real quick and got his new 52.5 time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 Takeo</font> continued his crazy spree, climbing another 7 spots and joining the real degen boys in the top 20. He got dozens of PRs, among them being really high ranked flaps on rDS and WGM as well as some really nice 3lap times like 1:13.3 rPB (getting a glitch run here would be big) as well as a 1:49 TF g run (his ng run is still unfortunately standing at a 1:51.omega). Some other cool runs are a 1:51.7 WGM ng, 1:35.8 rDH ng, 1:18.4 flat on rMC3 as well as a DC 1:29.7. Pretty good PR spree bro, let's keep it up and challenge the top 10!<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Dane Allen</font> got 1:50 rWS and 2:31 rBC (I am so jealous omfg) as well as a nice MG cookie flap on the side, thats pretty epic for an item box player<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> is still somehow in the top 25, i swear he's been #25 for like the past year. Anyway, he played a bit of the spear stuff at the start of the month with new times on MC and rPB. After this he realised that the glorious European heritage was in danger on DKM glitch and thought if nobody else is gonna defend the honour it might as well be him. He mixed his glitch sessions with ng and achieved some really sick times on all 4 DKM categories but the crown jewel was a 2:00.4 on glitch. Thank you for representing all Europe, I will do all I can to nullify Greece's dept (The Player's Page council secretly controls the European parlament dw).<br><br><br><font color=red>There's still some hope</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Luke Berrill</font> set his first PRs this decade with a low 1:32 on rMC as well as a low 1:51 on rWS. Welcome back mr bigshot POTY 2014<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> got a very very low 2:06 on rDS and a high 2:18 on BC3 ng.

Ironically it seems that DK is probably Luke's closest match here. Luke then moved to optimizing his rPG BB time and pushed it to a 1:59.4 with the Scorpi strat™.

261	Is Good Friday even that good if there is no news update?	<p><b>The MKW grind is identical to the righteous ways of spiritual men. We dedicate our lives to the cause, distancing ourselves from worldly pleasures, remaining celibate, all for the good grace of reaching God (standard). Thanks to this realization I no longer regard top players as degenerates, but great prophets, the purest of all men. I'm glad to call you brothers and sisters in the fight for enlightenment. Mango Man was right all along.<br><br>Thanks to this realization this news update will be dedicated to the holy and mysterious ways of Kart. I hope you enjoy reading the gospel on this holiest of days.<br><br>So what happened during this month of Lent? What sacrifices were made? Let's find out.<br><br><br>The month's achievements started off with Evangelist Luke Brown fighting off the evil spirits of Braixen to reclaim ownership for what was truly his, the MH crown. Congratulations Luke.<br><br>The next great battle was fought on Maple Treeway, the second holiest of all sites within the ways of Kart, thanks to Benny's strat finally being picked up like a year after discovery lol. The famed JCool reclaimed his past ways after years of sin and was forgiven by our Lord Troy Dunbeck, who granted him a World Record. Unfortunately the evil might of Logan was too great to hold off, and the antichrist took this WR from him.<br><br>The antichrist would however, not be unstoppable this month. His vulnerabilities was exposed by Hunter, the man from God's city, the Holiest of all non-MKW locations: Texas. Hunter would fight off the urge to surrender his grind to the great evil, and finally all his pain was taken away with 2 new WRs on rWS. All he had to do to break the curse was to praise QM, the holiest of all game mechanics.<br><br>A humble man simply named Justin completed his struggle towards the 1:46 on DDR. Unfortunately his ways are not pure, and God punished him with a missed trick on the Final Lap, causing Justin to fail to beat Saint Blackyboi and remain 2nd place once again.<br><br>Patience is a virtue. This was known by the ancient stylites such as Simeon, who climbed a pillar in Syria in the year 423 and stayed there until his death 37 years later. This similar trait can be found in some of the greatest karters of the day, such as Jack Gluesing, who once again improved his SGB glitch flap this month. Stay pure, stay devoted.<br><br>Barney, the banished Norwegian karter came back with a bang on GV ng with a new clutch WR with a new L3 BKS. Naturally this run is only recognized by the unholy and sinful sites of MKLeaderboards and MKwrs. Barney will never be able to inherit the kingdom of God. God hates filthy cheaters and does not forgive these sins. Repent.<br><br>Big man james charles sexted with kids once again, THE MKW COMMUNITY IS SO PROUD OF YOUUUUUUUU even troy does collabs with you now, keep doing what you're doing bro!!!!!!!!! official verdict: definitely going to hell (and not just for being gay!) (am i actually gonna leave that in) (yeah its funny dont cancel pls)<br><br><br>Quote of the month:<br>Some days have been rough for me last year and something that put a smile on my face was watching CP videos at night.<br><i>SpicyDorito08</i><br><br>Bible Quote of the month:<br>For nothing will be impossible with God.<br><i>Luke 1:37 (this is why he has so many WRs)</i><br><br>This news update covers from Mar 2 2021 to Mar 31 2021<br><br><br>Newcomers to the faith:<br><br><font color=lime><br>Acquiesce (Australian)<br>Robvin (what)<br>Nicolas Chomette (hon hon)<br>Hedwig (#3 Finnish, #2 Savonmaa)<br>William Texas (he actually joined what)<br>Jack1337 (the kinda guy to type 5318008 into a calculator)<br>MxCraven (McRaren x Wes Craven mashup)<br>JoshNFLD (doin your dad)<br>Alex Maia (Portuguese)<br>Ethan Paul (Jake Paul Brother)<br></font><br><br><br><font color=red>The Divine 10</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Justin "Holy Father of Kart" Hitchcock</font> started the month by achieving the joy of a 1:46 on DDR with a missed zipper trick. Afterwards he realised to TAS GV2 ng? And found that the ramp can be faster by like literally .05 every lap on RTA lol. Due to his hatred towards tricks after the DDR run, he decided not to use them in his new RTA run however, but instead using the start slide with the bowser bike to save like 4 ms??? God truly works in mysterious ways.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Logan "Glitch reliant heathen, sinful false prophet, The Antichrist" bBirbPog</font> focused on taking the MT glitch WR back from the righteous man. Only glitches this month as usual. Never trust a man who plays glitches.<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Arvo "MKW Gospeler" Koskikallio</font> has been on a big rYF break after not getting anything for ages, hopping on the MT bandwagon, getting a 2/3 that lost 2 seconds after l3 cannon fml. Also played MT and GV g flaps (hydr8ion was destroyed) as well as some rBC for 2:31 and rSGB glitch flap to reach enlightenment. Right now I'm too busy blaspheming to play MKW however.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 David "Proverbs 22:24" Morton</font> got a bunch of times to cut AF this month as well as actually getting BC3 3/3 ultra (this was actually last month but I didn't mention it which caused him to call be a naughty word) He also got rPG sub 2 with the incorrect vehicle, 1:41(.945!!!!) rMR, 1:48 DDR and a brand new TF no glitch PR! All of this, however, is just distraction from daFact that he does not have 58.5 on rYF LOL! imagine not having 58.5! He also sent me some new times but i dont really care so i wont mention them except for the fact that he bopped Thomas yes!<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Jack "King David" Gluesing</font> played a bunch of stuff for AF but did also get some bangers, including a better 1:59.99x on rPG and an INCREDIBLE 16.7 rSGB flap. 16.6 is actually possible, keep going you beautiful man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Zed "Colin Dickson" R</font> got a KC (no glitch) flap lol<br><br><br><font color=red>The followers</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#11 Vincent "not that Vincent" Nguyen</font> had a relatively slow month, only really playing KC at first but eventually reaching enlightenment on the one and only SGB glitch flap, getting 3rd WW there. Congratulations on becoming a true chad.<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Jay "Ejay" Rangthale</font> played some really weird stuff but found his next passion project on rMC, getting a 1:30 pretty fast and also achieving l2/3 BKS with a 30.007. 29 is soon. Legend says he will get rMC WR thanks to a 40 days and 40 night grind after this news update.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Jake "Job 39:5" Harrison</font> SGB glitch YES YES YES but he beat me on rSL glitch because of better driving how cringe. He also played some weird stuff like rMC and DKS which is pretty cool but nobody really cares, we will all die one day and these runs will mean nothing lol<br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Ta "DOGEcoin" keo</font> did a bunch of AF grinding to bop a grand total of 1 person (Silver). Pretty epic L2 glitch run on DKJP tho, lets go<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Bynt "Imagine having a dot at the end of your name" .</font> cut an ungodly amount of AF to rocket straight from #50 to the top 20 this month. He improved on like half the tracks lol. Highlights: rPG 1:59.8, rWS 1:52.069 (funny number) (use turnskip sword wannabe), DKJP 1:48 (bullied into sinning on glitch categories, and 2:13.1 on non-sinful DKJP<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Luke "The Evangelist" Brown</font> got an MH 2nd WW (Chad has wr) and is going for the legendary 1:42. He also learned the evil ways of glitching which caused him to get all the way to the top 20 just like Bynt. When is that sub 1 on WGM coming THO<br><br><font color=yellow>#22 Dane "Mogi" Allen</font> was a glitchscrub (just like Luke) and played MT, DKM and DKJP glitches. He also got some DDR run which is kinda epic low key high key middle key bro<br><br><br><font color=red>The righteous</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Indy "Sus" Kambeitz</font> played like 50% glitch flaps. He did however get some real times such as a 1:51 on DKJP glitch and a 1:51.7 WGM, quite impressive<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Stavros "No Glitch" Ferentinos</font> got a KC flap (no glitch of course)<br><br><font color=yellow>#32 Aziz "Runs on a pregnancy test" Abdullah</font> had himself another near flap-excusive month, cutting DKM ng quite close to WR (Justin too fast) but did also manage to improve on BCWii ng towards the end of the month, nice stuff<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 Carter "Manual" Clem</font>, after not playing since last year, came back to see his precious MT glitch be completely double-fisted by Benny. He had to hop onto the bandwagon and stay relevant, which he did, getting a low 1:54 with the new method.<br><br><font color=yellow>#39 Ruby "im from aruba bro trust me" Aruba</font> got random flaps on LC and MC3 after not playing since march 2020?<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Kevin "The messenger of the Player's Page" Miller</font> only cut a bit of AF this month despite playing quite a few categories, his main claim to fame was definitely doing a little trolling on the MKL mods by mixing times up with Jyran and stuff I can't even remember who got what time, but regardless he did get a new rDH glitch time but is no longer on the WW tops lol! at least he beat troy<br><br><font color=yellow>#44 Joe "mama" blase</font> Played too much MKW this month and completed his timesheet thanks to submitting last place times on a few of his least favourite tracks. Bro git gud some of your times are Korben down syndrome tier<br><br><font color=yellow>#45 Alex "Innovators in speedrunning deserve more recognition." Shoal</font> deserves more recognition.

He also totally destroyed Ultra_Pear this month with a giant almost 20 AF cut. The most notable of these times is definitely his random out of nowhere 53.8 on MC. I guess he learned tas glitch.<br><br><font color=yellow>#61 F"uck scorpi" atality</font> got a ton of PRs this month despite never really playing the game that much lol... I'm not even gonna mention any of the times because he never plays the game he had his yearly session of the year in january...<br><br><font color=yellow>#64 Wii "Actual" Lord "and saviour of MKW for real this time" 95</font> made his comeback 2.0 to get sub 2 on MT with the Benjamin strategy, it was actually on CTGP this time HAHA GOTTEM I WROTE THIS ON APRIL FOOLS IT WASNT ON CTGP<br><br><font color=yellow>#70 Ultra "Wageslave" _Pear</font> just told me to go sleep but i failed so I'm just gonna write mean things about him instead like LOL you are a total of 12 positions behind Invincible.

So like once a year<br><br>Q: Why come back you said you were gonna leave????<br>A: If you announce your retirement you will always come back<br><br>Q: Why are you doing a Q&A with your own questions and your own answers<br>A: Because I suffer from multiple personality syndrome<br><br>Q: Take your pills<br>A: fuck off<br><br><br>ok lets get into the actual news update, let's start off with a recent drama<br><br>the community legend Jordan Albanese aka Jordan Highway mistook the MKW community for the American Cancer Society and accidentally deleted the last 4 years of recordings due to this mistake. The PP got in contact with Mr. Albanese for an interview, here's what he had to say:<br><br>Nope definitely not thinking about mkw rn, so happy I don't play it anymore (it sucks so much!!) god I hope that the ppl who still play it get a life someday<br><i>Jordan Albanese</i><br><br>I hope your wishes will come true Mr. Highway. We will be waiting to accept you back into the community with open arms in a few months!<br><br>And in other news, the community legend who's real name I cannot disclose for legal reasons due to him being removed from the PP, got removed from the PP. I will refer to him only by the codename "Trisomy-21". So. Trisomy-21 finished the work of the great Thomas Capel who was sadly bluepilled some time ago. Trisomy-21 said so many gamer words and spread so many jewish conspiracy theories that the powers at will booted him from the site. These mods would never survive in cod lobbies smh!!!!!<br><br>oh yeah and sword0fseals also got booted from the site for some good old relations with a 16-year-old, Naomi groomed 3 kids, Colin the mega mushroom is mad because he admitted to pedophilia and now people are disliking his videos but you know let's sweep all that under the rug so the community can have a good image guys<br><br><br>Ok now that we have documented the legendary stories, we will actually talk about the game and definitely not talk about pedophilia again because that's not an appropriate topic to discuss with minors reading the news update, kids should just be blissfully unaware about this so they're easier to take advantage of, eh?<br><br>so yeah<br><br>Logan implemented the rDS shroomless dock which caused Luke_GB to go on a moral mission where he was not going to be using mt strat even though it was COMPLETELY FREE, simply because he wanted to use the strats he was comfortable with. Luke got a 2/3 shroomless dock run shortly after.<br><br>Flare pushed his RR slower category WR further and further but SURPRISE CHALLENGER, Kaede, approached his record with rejuvenated drive to lessen the American imperialists' grip on the WR count. He is very close and I'm hopeful that we will see RR pushed down to 2:24.4 at some point in the future with this new competition.<br><br>Sosis pushed rMR to a 1:41.1, and I heard through the grapevine that he was paid $200 for this feat by an unnamed sponsor. dont spend it all at once mate<br><br>The legendary MKW's 3rd best Vincent finally got himself a WR, on GV2 glitch of all courses. This WR lasted 3 days after which Logan pushed it down to a 49 which is what Logan tends to do. It's not all over though, since Vincent has proven himself to be pretty damn good at the glitch, finishing L1 BKS shortly after Logan's push. This ain't over yet Logan!<br><br>And yeah Logan got a ton of WRs mostly on TF yeah yeah don't care I only support the underdogs<br><br>Quote of the 2 and a half months:<br><br>@Hydr8ion news<br><i>MKW community as a whole</i><br><br><br>Bible quote of the 2 and a half months:<br><br>See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!<br><i>Galatians 6:11</i><br><br><br>This news update covers from June 11 2021 to August 28 2021<br><br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime><br>Spencer Sassak (fellow obscure statistic nerd/#1 link provider)<br>Stork (Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills.)<br>Mattinatorr (this is the kinda username you make when you're 12 and you're forced to live with the rest of your life)<br>James Collins (normie name)<br>Raphael Atherton (the ph in raphael is a nice touch, props to your parents, S-tier name for sure)<br>James Murask (James Villa is the one true James in my book)<br>Gabe M (you wish you were g walers)<br>Cam..

He also improved rBC ng tonight i think but I cba to check what it was either way good job keep up the domination<br><br>I am <font color=yellow>#4 Arvo Koskikallio</font> and I don't want to refer to myself in the third person again because to comes off as arrogant which I definitely am not (this is sarcasm, i am a legend and only lose to people because i don't really try that hard lol). So yeah. I started off by pushing my rPB ng time down to a 1:13.1, then briefly trackhopping until playing rWS for a few hours and somehow getting the god run for my standards and almost getting 1:50 despite not knowing how to play the track and always failing all the tech lmao always lucky. After that I moved on to MMM which was surprisingly kind of fun and I pushed my PB to 1:16.1 and somehow clutching the fuck out of flap and finishing a 23.8 bye bye never playing that flap again lets gooo. Then I moved on to CM glitch (shroomless entry is eternal pain please give advice) and LC (failed 1:09.3 at l3 cut aaaaaaaaaaa) Ok yeah thats enough of talking about yourself you egocentric man<br><br>The young prodigy <font color=yellow>#9 Jack Gluesing</font> finished off the LC grind with a .750 flap and moved on to TF, where he got close to both 1:49 3lap and 34 flap but atm it's just unfinished business for this legend. In July he tackled one of his weaker tracks, BCWii glitch, getting to a reasonable base to improve upon there (+ rank 69 3lap!!!) In August he made a mockery of rBC, making 2:31 look like a cakewalk and improving his rMR closer to 1:41. These improvements were accompanied by world-class flaps, as always. Totom bop is coming soon my man<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#11 Aziz Abdullah</font> improved his DKM glitch times, WGM ng as well as his rYF flap and dipped to do whatever it is people with lives do<br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Vincent Nguyen</font> got 3rd WW on TF glitch damn mate I completely forgot that happened. He also got 1:49 damn. After the TF grinds he went balls in on GV2 glitch, getting his WR and L1 BKS/Flap WR. After this Vincent decided to chill on some Bowser tracks, including BC3 ng and BCWii glitch. enjoy it<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Jay Rangthale</font> got way more things that I remembered, he got 1:55 CM???? I've been living under a rock or something, ok yeah some quality flaps on rDS and LC yeah yeah and 1:49.2 I remember that I think, ok yeah and then rMR WR + flap WR and now he's pushing rPG with BB and as I'm writing this they're arguing in the tt server whether or not .9 .7 is 1:59 pace on rPG im so proud of this community<br><br>HOW IS <font color=yellow>#14 Danny Gallenberger</font> IN THE TOP 15 WHAT PLANET ARE WE ON yeah he just trackhopped about for 2 months and cut like 20+ spots lol lets go danny G the district champion of wii wheel throwing <br><br><font color=yellow>#15 Jake Harrison</font> got a KC ng flap probably in between mogi events<br><br>How is that <font color=yellow>#19 Bynt.</font> #14 what's happened while I was MIA. wait what he's #19 on the charts now what the fuck is going on mr. stat program. OK I'm gonna assume #19 is right because Bynt only finishes good runs on dolphin. how did he get 1:59.5 on BC3 I want that run ok 1:47 TF is for amateurs even I have 1:46 and ok yeah 1:49.8 thats probably just tas coding the wr before the last low and he lost over .6 on the low, 1:12.888 rPB ok thats legit because thats the only track bynt can play, 2:04.7 rSL is definitely a glitch run, 2:18.2 BC3 prob sc run 2:06 DKM definitely a glitch run and 1:50.009 on DKS is 100% 3/3 jimmy, 21.7 GV is more his level of a time, 2:28.8 RR is with glitch (moonjump code on), 1:42.1 rMR was with arjuns secret glitch, 1:50.4 rWS also glitch moonjump and according to this he has a 42.7 on DKJP glitch congrats on 2nd WW! That's probably legit because he's glitch reliant. So in a nutshell I think Bynt is one of the most blatant cheaters in modern MKW history and I will be removing him from the website ASAP. (OK actually it turns out he just misspelt glitch as "giltch" what a dumbass  :D :D :D :D fixed that for you) (actually I have come to the conclusion that this was a deliberate attempt to appear higher up in the news update and will have to ban you for journalistic fraud. goodbye)<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Better Steve</font> went full simp and only played daisy tracks, starting off with BC3 sc (or at least I think he used daisy because it's more consistent and better steve does not like glitches) (neither does the worse steve tbf) Steve proved his love for consistency by moving to MC3 and improving his times there. And it was BCWii g time afterwards because Jared is brainwashing the entire community to play BCWii so his WR can look better<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Luke Brown</font> got the rDS record but didnt submit and the stat program didnt pick it up and i had to add him late and that isnt so nice! how could you luke<br><br><br><font color=red>25-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Dane Allen</font> got a 1:50.1 TF and 2:20.1 KC go get those subs and stop playing ctww<br><br><font color=yellow>#30 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> is my #1 source of news about American politics but has also enjoyed some casual MKW grinds at times, clutching out a 15.659 on rPB glitch flap, getting a 27.7 rDH glitch flap + 29.7 ng as well as a 36.3 rWS flap. Loads of flaps because they're a path towards enlightenment.<br><br>Remember Joeblase? This is him now: <font color=yellow>#32 Joe S.</font>, feel old yet? Congratulations on quitting the game! Now let's go through what he did over these past few months. Joe pushed his TF time to a 1:49.725 with a phat 84 drop on l3. Afterwards Joe got a 1:50.1 DKS and a 1:52 GV! In August he has taken it easy and improved some of his weaker times, as well as re-uploading loads of times after Jordan's kamikaze attack on CTGP Alt records. Also he apparently benched 225 lbs CONGRATS!!!!!!!<br><br><font color=yellow>#45 Hydr8ion</font> has kept up with the discord side of PP updating and also grinded the game himself, climbing all the way to the top 50 from #61 with big trackhopping. His crown jewel of this new period however has to be his brand new 3.259 GV glitch flap likely motivated by my fluke improvement that beat him on this elite category.<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Phyzothy</font> got some run but i forgot what it was<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#53 JMM435</font> improved some of his weaker (aka no glitch) runs. He also learned the TAS glitch on rSGB based and redpilled + new rPB (not 1:06 since its cursed)<br><br><font color=yellow>#57 Jacob Loerzel</font> 1:50 DKS, 34 CM and getting close to 1:50 TF (with the glitch!)<br><br><font color=yellow>#62 Filler</font> got 1:49 on both TF and DDR as well as sharpening up his weaker runs. Name reveal at top 50<br><br><font color=yellow>#67 Ultra_Pear</font> got some times but what the FUCK MAN! there are significant holes in the video recordings. please sort this out as soon as possible...<br><br><font color=yellow>#75 George Alberto Mark Toad Alberto Barba</font> got wrecked on MMM and his disc drive is trying hard to stop him from coming back. Alberto trackhopped his way up the ranking by around 10 spots, GAMT invite at top 10 i promise<br><br><font color=yellow>#80 Mo No</font> choked 1:49 TF and finished a .032 ouch. One day man<br><br><font color=yellow>#81 Watcha</font> got some pretty banging times such as 1:49.6 DKS (going for 1:48!), 1:56 CM, 1:40 DKJP g (probs with that stupid sign strat) and 1:51 WGM. Good shit altar mann<br><br><font color=yellow>#85 Claus</font> grinded his way up from #121 to #85 by following the trackhopping 101 course. The standout time imo is definitely on DKJP glitch (since he actually made the glitch although i suspect its the stupid sign strat)<br><br><font color=yellow>#88 Michele Gallastri</font> also got a million different PRs that boosted him back up to the top 100. Standout is probably TF 1:50.8.<br><br><font color=yellow>#94 Ethan Hedley</font> got a solid ass 2/3 run on TF as well as a flap (only true degen gamers play TF glitch flap lets goo), also a 1:44.7 MT nice nice and some random ng times (sub 2 CM!!!)<br><br><font color=yellow>#98 Clip80</font> played rWS, WGM and rSL to maintain his top 100 status<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#117 Nate Schultz</font> didn't trackhop around that much, instead focusing on just a few courses (notably MT, where he got a new glitch and ng prs + 44.2 ng flap with 2 shrooms mate whats going on here ok that was a pretty sick turnskip tbf)<br><br><font color=yellow>#118 Kjeld van Keulen</font> played for some of that sweet AF to prevent being passed by his countryman, the filmbro who watched too many mindfuck films and now thinks MKW is reality,<font color=yellow>#121 Leon Bisschops</font>. Leon played some stuff and got 1:53 GV (although I swear he already has that) and a 1:42.3 MG which is somehow ranked outside of the top 50 and gives me another reminder that I really need to pick up the TF physics gap there.<br><br><font color=yellow>#135 Enzo Leussink</font> almost got 1:49 TF ng and almost got 1:48 TF g nice nice. Also rDH glitch time that loses to the ng WR looool how embarassing wait i also lose to the ng WR<br><br><font color=yellow>#136 Samuel W</font> got a 1:22.2 MC and then trackhopped around July and dipped.<br><br><font color=yellow>#138 ArthurOww</font> made another batch of improvements as always, this time the highlight being a 1:44.1 MH which caused him to pour out the longest essay I've ever seen. I see some things have not changed. Keep it up, 1:43 will happen as soon as L3 goes right once.<br><br><font color=yellow>#142 2ndmatt</font> got 2:04 rSL, 1:13.2 rPB as well as some more nice ng times but the highlight of this news period as well as probably his entire career has got to be the masterful rMC 1:30.992. It was in the making for a while and it finally happened, major congrats to you bickbork!<br><br><font color=yellow>#165 NRStar</font> got CM glitch times as well as a GV2 53.8 (with the glitch apparently??? that cant be right) and dipped for a few months after that. Hope you're doing well my man<br><br><font color=yellow>#166 Kenneth Bernales</font> has been on a subathon, getting 1:18 MC3, 2:19 MT and 1:44 MH. HE ALSO FINALLY BROKE HIS PURITAN WAYS AND GOT A GV GLITCH TIME. THIS IS INCREDIBLE. dude probably cut like 10 AF with a GV 24 lmao<br><br><font color=yellow>#168 Jyran Liebs</font> got a bunch of stuff including a 1:07.007 rPB (ITS SO FUCKING CURSED I SWEAR THATS THE SAME DIGITS I HAD)<br><br><font color=yellow>#171 Nara Hiero</font> has the most confusing timesheet, its really consistently #171 tier until you see that he has 1:09.4 and 21.8 on LC lmao this guy has some potential for sure. Both those times were done in July btw<br><br><font color=yellow>#174 Rheece Wachow</font> is so close to beating the meme king <font color=yellow>#173 Troy Howard</font>.

Stay on the snowboard cross please, push that so far that nobody ever has to learn that track at a high level again.<br><br><font color=yellow>#187 Sebastian Manson</font> has been trackhopping like crazy, some of his better times this time around have to be 18.5 flap rYF and 22.5 flap rPB + 1:36.1 rDH ng. 1:35 is close. Also loving the amount of videos on this profile, big up!!!<br><br><font color=yellow>#189 StarBoi</font> got 33 MG, 2:27.1 RR and 1:19 DKJP, being the first to make the stupid sign strat 3/3.

Massive props, track specialists are few and far between these days and you've definitely mastered the art. 1:50 is out there man, you can definitely get that with a good enough run.<br><br><font color=yellow>#210 Darien Lupton</font> got 1:50.8 DDR and dipped for a couple of months, news update mention strategy at play once again I see<br><br><font color=yellow>#220 Ben Hurley</font> played a few tracks, got a few prs and cut a few spots.

First impressions: Amazing legendary BGM. Second Impressions: Big 1:59 potential for sure, just gotta get better chains and have better alignments. 3/3 is a god damn pain however and i dont get how so many people have done it. Also damn those MT paces show 2:17 potential for sure, just gotta risk it on the logs, maybe perfect the net a little bit and take the U-turn properly. Just the tight log + U-turn fix should already save like .2 per lap if not more.

Unlucky Bryce, stop being so racist you hitler loving fuck<br><br>Luke got Koopa Cape WR because he can't stop targetting Jongwoo (honestly so cringe I can't believe he would target people like this)<br><br>Logan got MH 1:42 and he didn't really even care that much really haha not that much of a big deal really (haha if i dont react all the 12 year old kids watching my stream will think im really cool and funny i think i should do that) fucking poser get real<br><br>Colin's favourite MKW player Sosis got a new PR on GV2 which is the first cool WR so far but I think JGB will beat this WR in approximately 17 centuries<br><br>Poyo managed to get another WGM glitch WR before developing arthritis (he is at least 47 years old)<br><br>Luke got rBC lol who cares boring track at least he didn't target anyone but himself this time<br><br>Scorpi found a new strat and Justin leeched off of it and managed to snag a quick DKJP WR (honestly surprising, Justin is usually very innovative but this time he just smooched off of Scorpi's hard work and intellect) (i love scorpi so much <3)<br><br>Connor got TF WR by aligning donkey kongs hair to form a consistent way to drive every turn<br><br>Kasey SGB WR (Sword is hoarding a 1:20 though and he will upload it soon and start streaming daily again, I for one will welcome him back with open arms)<br><br>Kei (who?) got a MC glitch WR (PROS: Logan lost a WR, New player gets a WR, First Mid 47.

Logan has been on his TWD98 arc trying to become a full-time professional MKW player (spoiler: it wont work) and has been playing some Time Trials (incredibly engaging stream I am sure) and got the MH WR as mentioned before. 10 WRs but still 0 bitches<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Justin HitchCOCK</font> got the DKJP WR and show's over come back next time for another Justin Hitchcock innovation (maybe he can innovate some bitches so Logan can leech off of Justin's innovations once again?)<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Arvo Koskikallio</font> hahaha i played rWS flap it was very easy I got the run in 5 minutes (it actually took 3 days peeposad) ALSO I BEAT KARHUMA'S MG NO GLITCH SHROOMLESS FINNISH RECORD, #1 FINLAND TILL THE DAY I DIE (maybe i will beat his record for most pedophile friends some day) (please don't find this once my friends get exposed as child molesters)<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Jack Gluesing</font> I FUCKING TOLD YOU GUYS HE WOULD MAKE IT the absolute prodigy, I can't wait to be overtaken by you sir. DKS times for some fat AF gains and a 3/3 glitch run on MT, the grind never stops<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 wah wah I hate america please let me move to nordics</font> also known as Bynt. played some MH (he is not happy with his time), MC3 (he is not happy with his time), GV2 (he is not happy with his time), GV (he is not happy with his time) and rYF (he hates this track almost as much as he hates america). Nice job Bynt.!<br><br><br><font color=red>Mediocre at best</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#17 Dane Allen</font> ever since he showed me where he lives on google maps I've been living inside his walls haha there he is going to the bathroom right now. He got a PB on BC3 (i was watching him get it and i can tell it was a really perfect run, don't think he can improve it.)<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 MKRFirestone</font> lets see here. rYF, MMM, rMR, rSL. seems AF-oriented. The things you gotta do to maintain top 25<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Phyzothy</font> omg surely some epic GV time? rDS world record perhaps? another shane hogan cake? ah just some flaps. moving on<br><br><br><font color=red>At least you're trying</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Luke Brown</font> has a 1:06 on WGM glitch. He didn't set it this month but i just thought it was funny. nothing worth mentioning outside of that<br><br><font color=yellow>#29 The bad Carter</font> got a 1:49.3 on DDR. The good Carter could actually never get this time (prove me wrong i dare you)<br><br><font color=yellow>#35 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> got a 27.4 rDH flap and a 44.0 MT flap. Just foreplay before the 3/3 glitch rPB 58 I'm sure<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 Shane Hogan</font> how the fuck is he this high up what is happening in the community ok at least he is still glitch reliant, at least he got 1:50 on TF so not completely core i7/korben tier, moving up in the world! He also played the stupid ArthurOww GV challenge thing and did right side rock man he is so sweaty and cringe<br><br><font color=yellow>#39 Enzo Leussink</font> the GV rock hop michelangelo got some garbo times and some better times like 1:51.1 on WGM (probably 1:51.9 tier with full mickey mouse) and 1:49.8 on DKS (1:53 tier with 3/3 colin cuts I assume)<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Kevin Miller</font> chaos has still not given up his dream to be Kevin huh. Ok he posted like a million times so let me just mention all the good ones. rWS 1:49.6. ok moving on to the next player<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Lawrence</font> got a new KC glitch time.

He actually got some random rPB glitch time<br><br><font color=yellow>#57 Mitchell Healy</font> 17 on GV and 2:04 on rSL? Actual good times? Man I'm really out of touch with the community nowadays<br><br><font color=yellow>#61 Claus</font> played a bunch of random shit and got some ok times to gain some af to pass the top 2 most racist players in MKW, Ultra_Pear and Bryce.<br><br><font color=yellow>#63 Ultra_Pear</font> got muted in the tt server for being mean to Logan (why would ever do that he is the most awesome player) but didn't get kicked because they still need him to update the times (been there). He got a 1:51.5 on TF WITH THE GLITCH? HE REALLY GETS A NEWS UPDATE MENTION FOR THAT SHIT?? incredible<br><br><font color=yellow>#66 Bryce</font> black lives matter<br><br><font color=yellow>#lol 69 JAYOO</font> played some random garbage as usual including WGM glitch flap 9.0 with the stupid pole strategy. Honestly I think give it a few years he will be in the top 10 because he is willing to play all the dumb shit that nobody wants to play and his lines are at least slightly better than korben's<br><br><font color=yellow>#70 Michele Gallastri</font> i had no idea cross was still playing but i guess he got some pretty ok times mamma mia thats awesome. mushroom kingdom, here i come<br><br><font color=yellow>#75 Neptune</font> set some random times aswell and I thought i was gonna have to spout some nonsense again until i saw that he actually got a 1:18 on SGB glitch so theres something that stands out. That's awesome, thanks for helping me write my news update<br><br><font color=yellow>#83 Nate Schultz</font> got a 1:50 on DKS (definitely Jimmy-infested)<br><br><font color=yellow>#88 Nathan Inuktitut</font> 23.856 MMM flap. OK mate stop the TAS right now<br><br><br><font color=red>TWD98 fun room mains</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#101 Acquiesce</font> achieved a hanful of times on a few tracks. A notable example is Moonview Highway, on which he managed to set a time of 33 seconds and 240 milliseconds. This is a rather scrumptuous achievement. I shall serve you a letter of congratulation once we cross paths at the golf club.<br><br><font color=yellow>#117 Nara Hiero</font> omg yeah he got the CM glitch flap WR, fucking inspirational<br><br><font color=yellow>#129 Jadid</font> the schizophrenic excel-sheet making motherfucker took a break from trying to find out what region of Italy random people who drove a run with the royal racer on their friends wii 14 years ago are from to actually play MKW. he got a PB on LC and LC flap ( 22.002 omg so close to I PULLED AN OMEGA D: )<br><br><font color=yellow>#148 Sebastian Manson</font> omg that's sabby he got some random flaps but he made a fantastic video about his time in the MKW community and everyone needs to check it out. Go do real life shit now sabby don't look back<br><br><font color=yellow>#149 Ben Hurley</font> this is the weed smoking guy whos always on discord right omg like all his times are outside of the top 100 bro stop smoking weed and, as a great English philosopher once said, "actually do driving" (this is funny because ace beaton loves weed). Yeah he got some times whatever whatever<br><br><font color=yellow>#156 James Collins</font> ok this guy actually has vids of his times nice lets see his new DKJP glitch run video ok the BGM is by this guy called "Fleetwood Mac" who tf is that GG 0/10 video<br><br><font color=yellow>#160 Mystogan</font> TF 1:51, random flaps, the works. yeah<br><br><font color=yellow>#179 Kenneth Bernales</font> this is the fucking guy who hated glitches, has he played any glitches ok he has posted a 1:58.6 on CM. I don't think that's on the glitch category.<br><br><font color=yellow>#180 Supreme</font> set so many times but one of them has a video. DDR flap 33.9 and the description says "goofy ass flap" i don't think he is very happy with his times<br><br><font color=yellow>#182 Cederic</font> oh yeah this is the kid who updates and said that getting a MKW PB is more important than going to school. I think having opinions like these are a big reason why you should go to school. I will not mention any of your PB's because they are not important<br><br><br><font color=red>big brother let them play worldwides with them once</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#204 Ben Brophy</font> got some random rSL time wow thats really great im so happy for you<br><br><font color=yellow>#220 Aimee Scaricordi</font> bro i literally dont know<br><br><font color=yellow>#242 Lamness</font> finished his timesheet (whew i don't have to make up some random bullshit about another person I don't know again)<br><br><font color=yellow>#244 Evilninja</font> MH 1:44 YES CONGRATS<br><br><font color=yellow>#251 Spencer Sassak</font> I would say more random times but he actually got a low .6 on MC3 and that's .05 from my PB so I guess I don't really have a leg to stand on here<br><br><font color=yellow>#253 ElecTrick</font> literally like 45 times and none of them stand out<br><br><font color=yellow>#261 Zyxis</font> yes yes another timesheeter i can say something about you<br><br><font color=yellow>#265 Falco</font> his raceway time is in the bottom 10 of everyone on the players' page but then he gets a 1:49 on rWS and a 59.3 on rYF yeah this is normal behaviour. Also biggest AF gains (his old times were probably also bottom 10 material)<br><br><font color=yellow>#266 Luca R</font> is that a first 1:09 LC I see, welcome to being a real time trialer (everyone with a 1:10 is terrible and should snap their disc Liam Ashcroft style)<br><br><font color=yellow>#268 Ryan Lynch</font> more random times but his profile is giving lynchian vibes<br><br><font color=yellow>#272 Joshua Baldwin</font> got a 1:35.0 MT but des sniped his ass and he is once again over a second from the WR (it's ok he can get 3/3 treeclip 3/3 low cannon 3/3 triple net 1:24 within 3 decades)<br><br><font color=yellow>#280 Peyton Gunn</font> is this paytonkarting<br><br><font color=yellow>#283 Ragemodepigeon</font> i literally talked to him on discord like 30 minutes ago so i need to think of something for him. umm umm umm 2:08 rDS you know what that's kinda funny I'll give you that<br><br><font color=yellow>#293 Graden</font> i read his rPB time as 1:13.5 but it was actually 1:15.3 unlucky<br><br><font color=yellow>#337 Momo Y.F</font> MomoFifaHD finished his timesheeet<br><br><font color=yellow>#350 Pablo HernangÃ³mez</font> yeah im not even gonna bother correcting that name.

Very impressive since he said he would quit 3 years ago to pursue a college degree. Very peculiar indeed!<br><br>Some random child using the wii wheel got WGM glitch wr<br><br>Luke (Most washed up player in MKW history) used a new strat that saves .150 a lap to barely get a WR on BC3 that lasted like 3 weeks lololol<br><br>Vincent N was grinding the new RR glitch until Neptune (yes I am deadnaming him, his new name is stupid) got a 2/3 run. He will truly go down in MKW WR history as a revolutionary player as the likes of Konata, 4vex and Arvo. (Randoms who fluked a WR and nobody will know who they are in 5 years)<br><br>Sosis got a few MMM wrs to make ZeldaCubed cry (he will never get a WR)<br><br>kei pushed MC so far that Logan will never get that WR again, respect<br><br>Braixen's paranoia of not having the CM glitch WR took over him and he just had to get another one. Bro like nobody else has even tried the new thing you don't have to stress so much<br><br>Oh yeah and Lawrence got KC glitch WR but everyone knows that glitch doesn't count<br><br>Kierio04 uploaded a stupid youtube short that contained false information<br><br>There is a player on the site called "FEET TOES". I just want everyone to let that sink in for a moment.<br><br>Ok yeah that was pretty boring but give me a break I'm old and out of touch and these news updates can't write themselves (actually we did some tests with ChatGPT and I think they probably can write themselves soon)<br><br>Let me do some of these sections that the new kids added<br><br><u><b>Anniversaries</b></u><br><br>July 15 1799 - The Rosetta Stone is found in the Egyptian village of Rosetta by French Captain Pierre-François Bouchard during Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign.<br>July 15 1941 - Nazi Germany begins the deportation of 100,000 Jews from the occupied Netherlands to extermination camps.<br>July 15 1983 - Nintendo released the Famicom in Japan.<br>July 15 2006 - Twitter, later one of the largest social media platforms in the world, is launched.

(i recognize this name from mogi lounge so safe to assume he's a virgin)<br>Rey00 (only played 2 tracks apparently)<br>Cqrt3r (i have no comment about this username choice)<br>Gus..

I played some rSL thanks to inspiration from Aura. He might have outmatched me but we're both on regs now so I am happy. Then did some GV glitch and got a time, DKS flap also and got WW tops after about 73 hours of attempts, 3lap coming soon (not soon at all)<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Jack Gluesing</font> He might be ahead of me on the AF charts but this is my news update and I choose who's on the top!!!! He played like a million things and completely destroyed my podium position. Some of the highlights were making the RR glitch and falling off afterwards Korben style. Also got a 1:58.3 BC3 sc which is just fucking nuts what the hell. I could go on for so long with the praise but I will just say that you're a god damn monster at this game, may the rate of your progress be everlasting. Check again next year and I will put you ahead of me in the next news update I write, that's a promise<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Vincent Braixen</font> Yeah he got that cm thing<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 Vincent Nguyen</font> is a better man than me for 1:15 MMM, also the previously mentioned RR glitch and also 1:58.5 BC3 how is everyone so good at BC3 all of a sudden also 2:27 RR, I wonder if thats with the Twinkle Star idk cba to check. Then he also made rWS glitch. I need to move on to someone else because I'm getting too jealous at godlike abilities on categories I am god awful at<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Indy Kambeitz</font> is like, getting some times including a 1:50.6 on rWS. weexy<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 Mitchell Healy</font> got a 1:49.827 on rWS glitch. Everybody laugh.<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Jay Rangthale</font> yeah the MMM stuff you know it already<br><br><font color=yellow>#19 Eclipse</font> let's look at the definition of Fatality's fancy new name!<br><br>Eclipse: A falling into obscurity or decline, also: the state of being eclipsed. "His reputation has fallen into eclipse."<br><br>yeah sounds about right he didn't really get anything that good<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Doge.</font> TF 1:49 quite tasty, other times weren't tasty enough to note down<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Dane Allen</font> TF 1:49 aswell!!! But unfortunately runs into the same issue as Doge.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Jake Harrison</font> got a 1:48.2 and was so embarrassed that the vid of it is unlisted. You need to work on your confidence buddy<br><br><br><font color=red>25-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Ross Coleman</font> bruh what year is it, this dinosaur still plays? Yeah he's washed as hell what are these random times<br><br><font color=yellow>#29 Kevin Miller</font> had to suffer the terrible fate of receiving messages from lowercaseletters just so he can relay them onto me (still not sure why) MKW-wise he got nice subs on RR and rSL flap. Congratulations!<br><br><font color=yellow>#30 Luke Brown</font> other than the previously mentioned he got a 1:09.287 on LC with the bowser bike. Jokes aside that's absolutely fucking nuts<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 Ryley Carroll</font> dude literally drove a 1:49.2 on TF glitch 3 days ago to get a news update mention. He couldn't play for months due to unbelievable grief from Sanna Marin losing the Finnish prime minister title so it's fair, hope you're coping.<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> played some cheeky LC but mostly spent the months looking up obscure sports facts<br><br><font color=yellow>#43 Neptune</font> got RR 2/3 of course, also he got rWS 1:50.7, LC 1:09.5 and TF 1:50.9. I made those last 3 up, sorry about that<br><br><font color=yellow>#44 Lawrence</font> got a run on RR glitch (wow what a surprise) and CM glitch and KC glitch and TF glitch flap. Wait wtf he also got 1:15 on MMM. So he can play something else than glitches i am shocked<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#53 JAYOO, the proud holder of the fastest lap in MKW history</font> got MC 50.3 (wow!) and CM 33.2 (wow!) and GV2 glitch 52.4 (fuck you) and rDH 1:33.9 (just kidding) and 2:00 rPG (also kidding)<br><br><font color=yellow>#54 JMM435</font> got a 1:57.7 on CM. Knowing JMM i am sure he did infi tricks in this run<br><br><font color=yellow>#55 Exploder</font> got PR's on like 90% of the tracks there aint no way in hell im going throuh allat<br><br><font color=yellow>#58 Claus</font> got a 2:05 on MT in the year of our lord 2023. Dude you gotta get with the times and get on that 2/3 game (inb4 that is a 2/3 run)<br><br><font color=yellow>#60 Alex Shoal</font> made his annual return to prove to everyone and he's still got it and the arthritis has not completely destroyed his frail joins yet. He got WW tops on rSL. You can just tell from his timesheet that he is 40 years old since he still doesn't have a BC3 no sc time over a decade after it became a recognized category<br><br><font color=yellow>#72 Nara Hiero</font> did what <font color=yellow>#72 Nara Hiero</font> does best, randomly getting a WR on a sub-5 second flap category. This time it was on MG. You can tell tiktok has ruined his attention span just by looking at his top times, man can't concentrate on driving for more than 5 seconds. He also got a time on WGM glitch flap but that is a whopping 9 seconds long so it was only ww tops.<br><br><font color=yellow>#78 Nathan Socholotiuk</font> had himself a sub session, getting 1:51 rWS, 2:13 BC glitch, 2:22 BC ng and TF 1:50. If you can't sub what's even the point of playing anything.<br><br><font color=yellow>#80 Mo No</font> finally got his 1:49 TF, skipping .9 altogether. Divine justice for him.<br><br><font color=yellow>#90 Idriz</font> is one of the players of all time. His nearly 450-year old comeback after getting 1:17.5 on MMM back in 1547 is completely out of this world. Getting a 2:06.5 rDS in 1994 really put him on the map, but the fact he is still getting times nearly 5 centuries after getting into MKW is something else.<br><br><font color=yellow>#100 Acquiesce</font> is one of the great artists of the game. His tormented soul weeps for recognition that often slips through his fingers. This time his sorrow-filled driving lead to a 1:21.960 on MC and a 59.194 on rYF. I sympathise with you my brother-in-arms, for this game is a mere repressed memory within your deepest desires.<br><br><br><font color=red>The players that are starting to get hard to write about</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#103 Franco</font> cheeky old 2:12.5 bc and 2:30 rr<br><br><font color=yellow>#106 Cederic</font> rank 69 on rSL glitch haha<br><br><font color=yellow>#124 Jadid</font> got 2 times that don't make the top 150. Literally what do you want me to say<br><br><font color=yellow>#126 James Collins</font> ok shit there's a ton of vids I can say something funny here! OK his TF 1:52.0 description says he really likes the bgm he used but he didn't like enough to say what song it was. Thanks. Also there is an error message at the end of the video that I've never seen before. Thank you ObeisantBug 3808 (fuckin Cicada 3301 ass username)<br><br><font color=yellow>#138 Flooferdog</font> 1:16.7 MMM. First sub? Don't know.

Yesterday I beat my rPB no glitch PR after nearly 7 years, finally making MG glitch my oldest PR, something I knew would one day happen right as I finished that run, can't believe it's taken so long for that to happen.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#4</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#8</font>) <font color=yellow>Mitchell Healy</font> is getting dangerously close to me on the AF charts and approaching the podium at incredible pace. He got a 1:08.999 on LC, proving to the world that he can do some crazy shit when he puts in the effort. Recently he also got a 32.1 on WGM just as a small side quest to flex. Bro is gonna go far in this game, however his track tier list fucking sucks.

(he decides this every month) He got the big 4.0 on CM glitch flap, improved his MG glitch flap practically on command when Mitch got his time, and tied JAYU's GV glitch flap WR. He also got 32 on WGM, and almost beat the flap WR there. also 1:50 on WGM ng. this guy is putting ireland on the map<br><br><br><font color=red>25-50</font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#26</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#85</font>) <font color=yellow>Ryley Carroll</font> finally got his RR glitch after his long and painful grind. And he then proceeded to fall off. lol! He then proceeded to give up on MKW and move to SMK. I think he could go far on that game, because it is very feasible that his opposition might die of old age and not be able to contest Hydr8ion's times.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#30</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#22</font>) <font color=yellow>Kevin Miller</font> got banned from lounge for messing with the wrong people.

He's been streaming to get the 1:48 on TF ng soon. That shit looks so insanely daunting to go for, GL mate<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#34</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#52</font>) <font color=yellow>Exploder</font> followed my MC glitch flap tutorial and got himself a nice 9.0, epic. Also a bunch of times here and there, lot of glitches and recently a bit less glitches. Cut a ton of AF but not so many spots. top 30 coming soon<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#36</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#45</font>) <font color=yellow>Nara Hiero</font> keeps getting the Canada tops. However I am worried that Quebec might declare independence before the 32/32, you better hurry. Nara got some nice times, including a 2:07.1 on DKM and a 1:43.8 on MH. He also complained about being bad at DKM glitch in call and immediately got it 2 times in a row on SP, nice one!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#37</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#50</font>) <font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs</font> got a 1:15 on MMM as well as his 2/3 lucky glitch masterpiece on rDH. It took him a month to make a video about that just because the run was so glorious. Also he just blatantly targetted me and intentionally beat me on rDH glitch flap by 3ms just to taunt me. Not very sportmanslike, you should respect your elders.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#42</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#33</font>) <font color=yellow>Cqrt3r</font> completed his timesheet. Welcome aboard!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#46</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#65</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> talking about respecting your elders, Jacob gained my respect for getting a 10.7 on rSL. This immediately inspired me to pick it up and destroy him with a 10.4. Unlucky Jacob!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#47</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#82</font>) <font color=yellow>JAYOO</font> is too lazy to write this news update (using exams as an excuse when we all know you will fail them anyways). He got a 1:14 on SGB and sacrificed some of his gray matter for it (this will hurt your exam score) as well as a 1:37.6 on rSL glitch. He then got nothing for 2 months until his 1:32.6 on rDH. Either he is actually studying for his exams, or he really sucks and that time took 2 months to get. I suspect the latter. <br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#53</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#80</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Loerzel (#1 sign clip player)</font> lost his WR but at least he still has can still take solace in the fact that he is the #1 sign clip player in the world, and a famous sign clip specialist. In fact, some people actually refer to him as the father of modern sign clipping. In fact, I actually heard one anecdote about Jacob claiming that his sign clip prowess is what truly made him into the man he is today. I am glad that even in this time of sorrow, sign clip is still there for you. Nobody will ever take sign clip away from you, it's here to stay! Huzzah! ok wow he actually got 1:09.3 LC and made the RR glitch that's actually quite cool but not as cool as being the #1 sign clip player in the world<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#57</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#142</font>) <font color=yellow>Intel Core (#1 tree clip player)</font> omfg its the best tree clip player in the world! He started off with getting RR 2/3 like a fucking legend, and then proceeding to play the most random shit ever created to get that sub 46 minute total time. After that, he got the DKJP WR from Jacob, the notorious sign clip specialist. Core also took some time to beat his rWS glitch time, as well as his rDH glitch time and barely missing the sub.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#58</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#121</font>) <font color=yellow>Nate Schultz</font> got 1:18 on MC3, which he said was his, and I quote, "BEST RUN YET". I disagree personally, I think a 2:16 on MT is slightly better, but to each their own. Also WW top reclaim on MT glitch with a very funny ending, get in son. He also asked me to ally at 4 in the morning. im sure i can.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#62</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#53</font>) <font color=yellow>Claus</font> got 2:28 RR and a bunch of other stuff. He also broke 100 in all 3 of the GSC D6 finals matches against GAMT and left us in the dust. Good games.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#64</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#70</font>) <font color=yellow>Ultra_Pear</font> omg i'm so tired of writing about random ass PRs and I reached the king of bboring PRs. What has this guy done this month, I'm sure it will be just fascinating. 2:10 on MT glitch I am incredibly entertained, OK that RR glitch run was actually fire and I still watch the PR video every now and again, the L3 is fucking hilarious because I know exactly how that must feel. OK and that KC time where he did goofy strats, and now he is playing MC3 (the most boring ng track in the game bar rMR) Also bro there are gaps in the timesheet with no videos, I am disappointed in you.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#65</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Bryce</font> played some giga random stuff but finally reclaimed his MG glitch WR. Bryce and Idriz will fight over this shit for the rest of eternity, meanwhile everyone else is just twiddling their thumbs, I mean my 27.9 (over 8 seconds behind WR) is still 7th WW so that tells a lot about the state of this category.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#74</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#64</font>) <font color=yellow>Michele Gallastri</font> got a 2:11.6 on BCWii. That's pretty much it.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#76</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#63</font>) <font color=yellow>Boshi</font> loves flaps. He got flap tops on GV2 ng and LC. Also low 2:18 on MT 3lap. You must not play 3lap. Give yourself up to flap supremecy.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#82</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#68</font>) <font color=yellow>ArthurOww</font> is another guy who, like JAYU, is using "exams" as an excuse to not write this news update. MKW essayist, more like MKW excuseist. Random DDR PR, random SGB PR. If that SGB PR is with the magi I will allow it. OK, it's not even on chadsoft, so I can't see if it is. STOP CHEATING RUNS KARHUMA STYLE<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#88</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#43</font>) <font color=yellow>Acquiesce</font> got some stuff including a 1:15.8 on MMM and flap tops on rDH no glitch. When will someone finally beat Liam's WR on that category, it's legit the oldest flap WR by like 3 years and people can get .3s without the wheelie cut, c'mon lads can someone beat him already.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#92</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#97</font>) <font color=yellow>Owen Smith</font> got his first RR and MT glitch runs (bro you made RR before MT what THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU). He's been going for rWS glitch for a while, and jesus christ it's taking long. That glitch can die a slow and painful death man, I hope you can get it eventually. He also took a quick break from rWS to casually get 3/3 on DKJP sign clip, but he did not even get close to Invincible, the one true sign clip specialist.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#95</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#46</font>) <font color=yellow>Kasper</font> got WW tops on DKJP ng. I swear Kasper is the most spontanious player, he will just one day decide that some random track is his track, grind it for ages and get on WW tops. If it works it works, props to you.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#98</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>StarBoi</font> got some random shit in march to get mentioned on the news update and he will do it again right after I publish this, I know him too well. You better cut some big AF this time or you will be knocked off the top 100.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#99</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#103</font>) <font color=yellow>Cederic</font> is legit like the living embodiment of "those who can't do, teach". This dude gives such great advice, like when I was going for MC glitch he helped me a ton with treeless, and now I look and he imporoves his MC glitch time to a 1:12 in march. I don't think you need treeless for that. Well, at least knowledge is power, as they say.<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#105</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#69</font>) <font color=yellow>2ndmatt</font> is getting close to 1:28 on DC. I believe in you bro. He also got a low 1:50 on rWS, as well as a 52.908 on GV2 no glitch wow, it's not just rMC where this guy is a tank at. He also alted on Hydr8ion's wii, but it was very obvious because Hydr8ion does not set good times.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#108</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#96</font>) <font color=yellow>NITROFOX</font> oh ffs this is the random guy who joins the TT server calls and says nothing except "what the sigma" and then plays sound effects through his mic. I think he probably spends 18 hours per day on tiktok and 6 hours on MKW. Oh ok 1:35.5 on rDH thats pretty cool, and a 2:13.4 on DKJP thats pretty skibidi ohio sigma rizz shut the fuck up<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#109</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#95</font>) <font color=yellow>Chloie</font> ok right I'm starting to see names like these and I know I've entered the territory of times that all start to blend together, let's see here. Yeah I mean 1:14.0 on rPB, I know you can get the sub bro<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#120</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#123</font>) <font color=yellow>James Collins</font> oh yes its Obeisant with his most alpha male vehicle choices. WHAT HE GOT A BCWII GLITCH RUN BUT DIDN'T USE THE SPEAR this is very disappointing, daisy is for normies. And it's a 2:18 with 3 glitches. At least you used Nightcore - Witchcraft as the BGM so I can't hate on it too much.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#129</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#89</font>) <font color=yellow>Supreme</font> is barely not on the top 100 on his new rYF flap. I know you can do it.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#163</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#187</font>) <font color=yellow>Ian Beler</font> set many times, 1:51.5 is the best one out of them.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#166</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#136</font>) <font color=yellow>Dylan Lepeirtz</font> omg 59.999 on rYF, dude must have been so happy, lfg<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#167</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#133</font>) <font color=yellow>Darragh J</font> did NOT set his rPG 1:59.269 last month.

Ben Hurley is slow.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#193</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#126</font>) <font color=yellow>Spencer Sassak</font> gives me PTSD due to my MKL + PP data merging script giving all of Spencer's flap times to a Norwegian guy called Lok who by chance has exactly 1/1 ties with Spencer on MKL (they have the same LC time). Oh shit 1:51.8 on TF with mach? 1:18.4 on MC3? Pretty cool mate!<br><br><br><font color=red>200-</font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#202</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#158</font>) <font color=yellow>Ryan Lynch</font> is another news mention farmer who got a 2:33.5 rBC and then stopped playing.

Still waiting for the 2024 one. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that this guy will fluke a time out that's a lot better than the rest of his runs soon. He got 1:09.5 on LC, I see the potential<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#208</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#157</font>) <font color=yellow>ElecTrick</font> oh yeah, he got 2:29 on RR just 2 days ago, congrats! He does not have pronouns.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#212</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Darien Bawpers</font> is like when you order Justin from Wish, he's been posting some crazy ass online strat compilations that might become the meta in the year 2041. He got a 42.797 on MG which I swear ties an old PB I used to have here. He also got a 34.1 TF glitch flap, but no 3lap run. Big sadge.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#217</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#132</font>) <font color=yellow>Anonymous</font> ayo 1:41 on MG?

283	The Lost Weekend	<p>As a companion piece to this news update, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4ENTB6XWWk" target="_blank">this mix</a>. <br>Please consider the following news update as financial advice and share your top 3 players you would invest on based on this month's activity.<br><br><b><br><br>Why hello there! <br><br>After quitting drinking 2 weeks ago and today watching the film The Lost Weekend (1945), where an alcoholic writer is unable to do any writing because he is out getting drunk every day, I don't think I have any other choice than to write a news update today to prove to myself that he is not literally me. I will finish this paragraph, go have some lunch, go to the gym, and afterwards come back home and finish this news update in one sitting.<br><br>OK I'm back. So what has happened during the last month?<br><br>Definitely the most notable thing is Justin's new alignment ghost strategy for rSL 2/3, it's only been about 3 days since it has been made public and there have already been many people who have set their first 2/3 runs with it. The players are:<br><br>- Justin (because why not take advantage of what you invented)<br>- Sam F (even lowercaseletters could tell you he would go for it, that's how obvious it was)<br>- JAYU (glitch addict, this was also fairly obvious)<br>- Joeblase (I thought he quit already, wtf is he doing playing this)<br>- ZeldaCubed (this dude having a 2/3 is on the level of WTF as a korben no glitch WW top, I didn't think he had it in him)<br>- Beanzard64 (1:39 - what else is there to say)<br><br>Maybe I'll give this strat a go at some point<br><br><br>Also, the floodgates finally opened on CM new glitch entry and it is no longer a Braixen-exclusive strategy. Beanzard64 surprised absolutely everyone and got his first ever WR with a mach bike entry, the only new player to have set a WR this year so far. Unfortunately he got beat the next day by Braixen, and then Braixen just kept improving. At least he didn't get the >1 treatment, and his legacy will live on in the WR snapshot. I'm sure he will have the 2024-07-04 snapshot bookmarked for the rest of his days, just like me with 2022-04-24.<br><br>After Beanzard's triumph, there were many bandwagoners who got their very own PBs. They were:<br><br>- Core (to absolutely nobody's surprise)<br>- Zoren (read above)<br>- Justin (I'm surprised he still has his wii at this point)<br>- Eli (again, nobody is surprised)<br>- Booshi (French representation)<br>- Logan (4lap BKT with a 31.0 - wtf)<br>- RZ (who?)<br><br>There were also so many other glitch WR, starting up with Bryce finally reclaiming the MG glitch WR. The 2 titans will battle this one out until one of them either dies or ends up in a mental ward.<br><br>Core also became a multi-WR holder, getting a 2/3 on RR and going for kart moonjump after to beat Danny Boy's WR with a slower vehicle. Bro is NOT afraid<br><br>Demon once again popped out of nowhere with a new MT glitch WR, and showing just how much you can still push it, I think Demon should get some therapy, MT is my favourite track also but this level of devotion has to be classified as attachment disorder.<br><br>Vincent N finally got a new SGB glitch WR, pushing it all the way to a 1:13.7. I can't comprehend how everyone pretty much thought the 1:14.5 was unbeatable, just for it to get pushed this far. Just shows how clueless we are as to where the limits are.<br><br>OK moving on, we had some actual skillful WR improvements this month, not just runs where you clip a wall and hope for the best.<br><br>Sosis got another 2 microimprovements on rSL no glitch, pushing it closer to the 2:03.5. In related news, Arjun has still not learned the cave (who would have guessed)<br><br>Emil improved his BCWii SC run (he lost time on the last geysers) and then improved it again (he lost even more time on the last geysers). I recommend mediation and chamomile tea to calm the nerves.<br><br>MC3 had an interesting month, it started off with Kasey finally getting his first WR there. This was followed by Vincent B (the unluckiest TTer) getting a run 1 milliseconds from Kasey's run. After this, Luke showed once again that he might not be the once-in-a-generation MKW sensation he once was, but he is still one of the best to ever do it, beating Kasey by a whopping 19 milliseconds (i hate how this is actually a massive lead on this stupid track)<br><br><br>Also in no relation to any gameplay news, Jared published his community IQ tier list and I am on the Harvard tier. This means you are all fucking stupid and should be thanking me (smartest MKW player) for providing such intellectual takes on the community once again, and presenting them in a digestible manner to you (objectively inferior Untermensch). Sorry for using that fancy word to end the previous sentence (you, yes you, the person reading this, do not know what it means, but I do (because I am smarter than you))<br><br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>TRACK OF THE MONTH:</u></font> I think it's fairly obvious that it's <font color=yellow>N64 Sherbet Land</font>.<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>DELUSIONAL QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <i>“back in my day you had to have skill to get rsl 2/3”</i> - <font color=yellow>Korben</font>, July 27th, 2024<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>ANCIENT QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <i>“whoa... i honestly didn't realize todd made a MB as well... and the kicker is, he used the exact same MB as I did  Shocked... think of the odds  well anyway... ”</i> - <font color=yellow>Jonesy</font>, February 20th, 2003<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>BIBLE QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <i>“Heaven and Earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.”</i> - <font color=yellow>Matthew 24:35</font><br><br><br>This news update covers from June 17th 2024 to July 27th 2024<br><br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime><br>BkPlayz (I don't know who this is.)<br>NE MKPatsfan (I don't know who this is.)<br>Jamari (I don't know who this is.)<br>Dudu.

At least he has a run with it, unlike yours truly.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Justin Hitchcock</font> got his (better) time with the CM new entry. However it is 26.001, LOL! He also got a 2/3 time on rSL with the new strat but I'm too lazy to go find out what it was. His toe has not ached so far this month but I heard he developed a slight rash on his elbow, and has been neglecting it. Take care of it bro, I could hit you up with some great cream recommendations.<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Arvo Koskikallio</font> is farming news update mentions?!?!?! I only PBd on GV no glitch, then went on holiday and haven't got back to it yet. I'm sure I will play more from now on...<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Mitchell Healy</font> put a ton of effort into CM, pushing his time down to a 1:56.2. Hella respect, that track is so hard. He played GV glitch flap and rYF flap on the side, improving both. After his CM grind he seems to have hopped onto DDR, getting a time 5ms slower than mine (you suck, n00b), and almost getting flap WR (i take back what I said)<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Jack Gluesing</font> has played quite a bit. He improved his rPB no glitch time, pushed his MC3 time to a 1:18.1 (woah) and, of course, not forgetting flap and becoming one of the few with a 23.8. After this he decided that rPB 2/3 must be done, and got it. He also improved on MMM once again, I don't know why anyone would play that track but well done.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 Vincent Braixen</font> got many CM glitch improvements as stated before, and is probably pushing it towards a 23 second time as I am writing this.<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Vincent Nguyen</font> had 2 goals, improve SGB glitch and learn Vietnamese. He reached the first goal and wrote the longest description I've seen for a run since his last SGB glitch WR. As for the second goal I wish you luck, I lived with Vietnamese roommates for 3 years and I doubt I would ever be able to get the pronunciation down if I tried<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Ejay Borton</font> set a new DC PR yesterday wtf, I thought the stats program was trolling. Welcome back, but bottling Finland meetup unfortunately changed your news update alias from Paul Finnerty back to the old and reliable Ejay Borton. He is also attempting the new rSL glitch attempt on stream right now but sorry man I think I'm gonna watch Karhuma play some WWs instead.<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Bynt.</font> just failed 2:17 on KC sad doggo moment. 2:04.3 rSL, 1:18.0 MC3, 2:27.5 RR, 2:04.7 rDS, I'm gonna put it out here and say I would definitely invest in Bynt's timesheet, the data speaks for itself.<br><br><br><font color=red>Brahmins - Priests and Teachers</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Danny Boy</font> played like so much stuff, including a BCWii glitch flap which he likely set on psychedelics looking at the video he uploaded for it. he spammed the fuck out of my subscription feed, uploading like every run and pace he ever got. The runs he deemed good enough to be on his main channel were his MC glitch 3lap and flap (you have successfully passed MC glitch flap 101) and oddly enough BCWii no glitch flap which to be fair is fairly clean but what the hell is that BGM<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Dane Allen</font> continued his trackhopping adventures, his philosophy can be summarized by when he got a 1:41.7 on MG stating that he "could get a .5 relatively quickly", and when Will encouraged him to do so, he simply responded: "nope playing cm now I will not play anything for more than a few hours total". He has not improved on CM yet, so I don't think those few hours were successful.<br><br><font color=yellow>#21 Jyran Liebs</font> improved his rMR time and seemed to attempt to take part in "no 3lap July", setting only flap PRs until he couldn't stop himself and set a 3lap PR on DKS. Well, at least you lasted 19 days.<br><br><font color=yellow>#22 Jay Rangthale</font> improved rSL and I'm not even gonna check if he played anything else, I already know the answer is no<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Shane Hogan</font> improved on MH the day after I published my last news update and has not played since. Wakey wakey. (i did also hear he got the new CM glitch entry but threw it away, sadge)<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Kevin Miller</font> made his way to the top 25. Before I look at your timesheet I just want to say that we were talking about OG MKW in GAMT and someone mentioned Fw Chaos and Bally (our bagger) had no clue who he was, only knowing you. I didn't know it was even possible to be in the MKW community and not know who the OG chaos is. As far as your times go, I will just say this: 39.000 rDS flap, LOL!<br><br><br><font color=red>Kshatriyas - Warriors and Rulers</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Ryley Carroll</font> is MKW's only hope in the 2024 Karter Contest. Considering NMeade won last time, it is obvious that the MKW wave is stronger than it has ever been. He has promised he will only be dictator for one day if he wins. In terms of times, he attended a meetup and improved both his GV 3lap and flap times. <br><br><font color=yellow>#34 Exploder</font> played some cheeky MC3 and also got a new CM glitch time without the new entry. At least I hope the 34.0 was without the new entry.<br><br><font color=yellow>#38 Cqrt3r</font> I'm gonna be honest it is fucked up how there are so many Carter's in the community that you have to spell your name like that. At least you're cool with the fact that you are Carter #3, even including the 3 in your name. Carter jumped all the way to a 1:43.5 on MH, definitely the crowning achievement of this month. Very cool!<br><br><font color=yellow>#41 Olivier Luyckx</font> once again woke up from cryosleep to improve his KC time. Getting very close to 2:17, let's go man<br><br><font color=yellow>#47 JAYOO</font> got a nice sub 1:54 time on rWS with a 1:53.005. And then he got a 2/3 on rSL, with a very enthusiastic remark of "oh ok"<br><br><font color=yellow>#48 Intel Core</font> got a 1:18 on MC3 which is pretty good for a glitchscrub like him, then he got the CM and rSL stuff, but also 3rd WW on SGB glitch (JAYU is crying). RR 2/3 WR was pretty fucking crazy too. What wasn't crazy are some random no glitch times he got to boost his total time (you know you are a true glitch goblin when no glitch times are actually holding back your total time)<br><br><br><font color=red>Vaishyas - Farmers, Traders and Merchants</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#52 Jacob "Sign clip" Loerzel</font> got some random DDR flap PR so I could once again call him a sign clip specialist in this news update. Thank you, Jacob.<br><br><font color=yellow>#62 Ultra_Pear</font> got a bit too political again and played some woke categories like CM and GV no glitch. True conservatives know that the red charts don't matter. He also seems to have time travelled and set a rBC PR on December 2024. I know can't wait for Trump to win but breaking the space-time continuum is on a new level of impatience<br><br><font color=yellow>#65 Bryce</font> got the MG glitch WR and nothing else<br><br><font color=yellow>#81 Owen Smith</font> fucking FINALLY got the rWS glitch run, that was so overdue and watching the stream highlight was so sick. Massive congrats man, join the exclusive club of people who made their first glitch on a random driving practice attempt.<br><br><font color=yellow>#96 Cederic</font> played a few no glitch tracks and also gracefully gave me flap top perms so I could update some URLs, thank you very much<br><br><br><font color=red>Shudras - Laborers</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#123 Supreme</font> was disappointed on why I only talked about his rYF flap time last news update. This time around I am happy to say that he reached the top 100 on rYF flap, congratulations!!<br><br><font color=yellow>#134 Mystogan</font> decided that this month was a month of extremely cold and extremely hot temperature tracks and improved on rSL and BCWii.<br><br><font color=yellow>#162 Ian Beler</font> only improved on MMM.

He also got the first ever 34 flap on rWS and his reaction was a yawn emoji.

284	It was in the reign of Charles III that the below-named personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now	<p><b>Months pass, turn into years, life changes, flowers bloom and wither away, but the news updates never end. Yet again I've been called out of cryosleep to capture the profound leaps the community has made since the last news update.<br><br>Most profound leap has to be rSL 3/3 actually becoming a thing incredibly fast, everyone called Korben a stupid retard for thinking it would ever happen, now people can only call him a stupid retard on account of being stupid and retarded. Fair is fair, at least you were right in the end. Logan started off with a 1:00.116 run where he lost like 1.5 seconds because he went so far back after the respawn lap 3, truly an artistic move from him. However the real MVP here has to be Zoren, who got the first ever 3/3 landback run, as well as his first ever WR, which has been so long overdue. Honorable mention goes to Ace Beaton for getting 3/3, making his mark as probably one of the most insane character developments ever seen in this community with an top 3 WW glitch run at the time it was set.<br><br>Sosis once again improved his rSL no glitch record this time finally getting the big 2:03.5. Man is not playing around, his driving has been referred to as "Magic on Ice".<br><br>Luke beat Logan on KC after nearly 500 days, the old guard is fighting back against the zoomer king<br><br>Connor beat Barney on GV no-glitch with a 1:50.8, after which Barney simply sent a 4 second video of him turning his wii on in the private TT server. +1000 aura<br><br>Firestone decided to join me in waking up from cryosleep, getting the first ever 8.7 lap on MC glitch flap, as well as beating Liams 302930245 day flap WR on rDH no glitch. He also thought it was stupid that the ending rail strat was considered shortcut, and the people agreed. This lead to him getting another WR, which was beat by yours truly (I am very skilled I know), and then my brilliant and beautiful WR was crushed by .001 by Firestone again. Humanity is overrated.<br><br>Firestone also wrote a great base for the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/noglitchrules" target="_blank">new no glitch rules document</a>, which should help avoid some confusion on those (or just increase it, who knows)<br><br>Another cryosleep awaker this month was KingAlex, once gain beating the rPG flap WR with the stupid treeclip by a couple of milliseconds as an eternal reminder of the pain the PP time updaters have to go through reminding Joey2009 submitting his rPG 2:09.232 that "rPG actually has a glitch :nerd-emoji:, please mark it as no-glitch"<br><br>One of the most overlooked and crazy things that has happened for like actual years, the German Ice (yes, the guy who has a 19.5 GV on nanobike from like 2011) came back and just randomly dropped a new GV glitch flap WR. Bro really has 2 vids on his channel: a RR flap PR from 13 years ago and a 2.774 GV flap from 3 weeks ago, simply with a description that says "I'm back." THIS IS LIKE THE COLDEST COMEBACK IN MKW HISTORY AND IVE SEEN LIKE NOBODY TALK ABOUT IT<br><br>We have No-SC (red chart) champion history on the player's page now!

Good try, cheater!<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Arvo Koskikallio</font> I got myself a nice 1:19 on rSL glitch which I really wanna beat but no glitch called my name and I also got run on GV ng, WGM and DKS. Currently going for 1:47 on DKS. Also snatched that rDH flap WR for a little while, haven't had one of those for a long while<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Mitchell Healy</font> played SKM and a bunch of random flaps, then hopped on DDR to get a low 1:48 and is currently going for 32 on CM glitch I believe. Just vibin as always<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Vincent Nguyen</font> had himself a quick little rSL grind before going back to school, getting a 1:18.5. Glad to see that hitting the books is taking priority over hitting the racetrack, you are an inspiration to all the degens out there<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 David Morton</font> is one of those degens. He horrendously bottled a meetup in Finland and then bottled playing rSL for anything better than a measly 1:24. Is there anything this man does not bottle?<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Bynt.</font> fucking skipped 2:26 on RR and went straight from 2:27 to a 2:25.9. Who the FUCK does that. He also got 1:17 on MC3, and is continuing to prove to be one of the best players currently out there. Although he still cannot get 2:17 on KC. SAD!<br><br><font color=yellow>#11 Danny Boy (Zoomer Danny)</font> has been consistently rising on the charts and is getting very close to the top 10, hope to see that soon! Man he was on fire, he got a 1:18.5 on rSL, however slightly faster than Vincent N. But I gotta say, what the fuck is this loud ass BGM on this video. His MC no glitch 10th WW time was very sick to see after all this time, however the BGM is once again very bad. At least he finally redeemed himself with his excellent BGM for his CM glitch 3rd WW time, definitely being the crown jewel of this month for him. However, to quote Danny, that category "makes me wanna start an alcohol addiction". Being now 2 months sober myself, I would not recommend this, I would instead recommend NOT PLAYING STUPID IDIOTIC CATEGORIES!!!!<br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Danny Gallenberger (Boomer Danny)</font> did what he does best, hopping on the new glitch strat bandwagon and getting himself a supremely impressive 1:17.998 and clutching that sub. I like to think the game honoured his legacy and gave him the sub as a token of respect, Danny himself said that this run "could very well be the last cool thing I ever do [in MKW]". However I do doubt this a bit, Danny is living proof that the phrase "Can't teach an old dog new tricks" is just categorically false.<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 MKRFirestone</font> talking about old dogs, Firestone has been dropping so many bombs recently with his MC glitch and rDH no glitch flap WRs, but he did also get a 2/3 on rSL (even if he did slow down at the end like a foolish joker! Do you not wish to go fast?) He is also cooking something up on rDH glitch flap it seems, and he also got a 1:35.306 on rDH no glitch! I would wager that there's still quite a bit more left in the tank here.<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Dane Allen</font> makes it look easy with his 1:47 on DDR, 1:33 on rDH glitch, 1:49.8 on TF and 1:56.303 on CM. His mindset towards TTs is captured wonderfully by this conversation from the private TT server:<br><br>Will 14/08/2024 05:25<br>yooo what a time bro<br>go get tops<br><br>Thunder 14/08/2024 05:40<br>it's 9th na<br><br>Will 14/08/2024 05:40<br>i meant ww<br><br>Thunder 14/08/2024 05:40<br>guess you think I'm going to play a track for more than a day<br><br>Will 14/08/2024 06:05<br>What's stopping you<br><br>Thunder 14/08/2024 06:09<br>instant gratification and lack of patience<br><br>absolute brainrot!! At least it seems that you haven't played lounge in about a month, so I am hopeful that he is taking care of himself.<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#21 Jyran Liebs</font> literally just got sub 2 on BC3 SC to clutch out the news update mention. Unfortunately he is still failing on GV glitch to retake the WR from Niyake. Cmon at this point Niyake will probably be so old that he won't be able to get it back, get on it bro!<br><br><font color=yellow>#22 Kevin Miller</font> has like an exhausting amount of new times, I will choose some highlights: uhhhh well he got 3rd ww on rDH flap... idk these are like all really cool times but there are like 30 of them that I'm just gonna have to say that he bopped sosis<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Jay Rangthale</font> got bopped by big Kev Miller. You see, when you only improve your own WR, you do not cut any AF. You should take notes here. OK to be fair he did apparently get a 1:48 on DKS, but it did not help him in defending his prized #22 spot against Kevin.<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Joeblase</font> made his way into the top 25 this month by hopping on RR glitch, remarking that he "made phantom glitch in 30 minutes, lmao, wtf". Everyone who has struggled on RR for days upon days, please raise a collective middle finger to Joe. He did also play some real category with a rather swanky 1:43.252 on MH, proving that he can also get chains on top of being able to do glitches.<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Ryley Carroll</font> was able to get his 2/3 on rSL with a 1:28. Aaron W did not believe he would be able to do this, but he once again proved the opposition wrong. I am going to go one further and say that he may also be able to one day get a run on RR glitch that does not fall off after making the glitch. Aaron W might disagree.<br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Luke Brown</font> got WR on KC and 2nd WW on MC3 flap. He also (FUCKING FINALLY) improved his stupid 1:06 on WGM glitch to a 37.6 a month ago which I had to update during the writing of this news update. This cut him literally like 300 positions and went from #35 to #28. The deed is done. Next up: SOMETHING BETTER THAN a 23.6 ON GV, OR ANY MC GLITCH TIME - YOU ALREADY HAVE A FLAP ON THAT<br><br><font color=yellow>#29 Jake Harrison</font> oh would you look at that, another rSL 2/3!!! a 1:25! Wow, how original Jake!<br><br><font color=yellow>#31 Phyz Phyz</font> decided to anonymize his username, however he has decided to keep his fake email (@lmfao.com) on his profile which still has his real name. Interesting. Phyz had a quick gaming stint, getting a 2:18 on KC, as well as a 3rd WW flap time. He also hopped on MC3 flap to get that sub 24, love to see a man here who does not skip flap day.<br><br><font color=yellow>#32 Exploder</font> is a dirty Norwegian oil tycoon who is on twitch 24/7 because of his annual multi-million oil trade deal with Jeff Bezos. He beat my Nordic record on rSL. I must stop listing his accomplishments because of the overwhelming urge to invade northern Norway because <s>of oil</s> those lands are rightfully Sámi, and therefore Fenno-Ugric, and the Norwegian government is mistreating our brothers and sisters.<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 Nara Hiero</font> got himself a rDH 3/3 time, albeit a Ross C/TWD98-esque 1:33.8. Many other great times including a rSL 2/3, but he only cut 1 spot on the charts due to a bit of a gap at the low 70-high 60 range. He's getting closer to the jungle of high 50 AFs though, the top 25 is closer than it seems.<br> <br><font color=yellow>#38 Cqrt3r</font> only improved his MC3 to a 1:18.457. He didn't skip flap day, although leaving the flap as a 24.014 is a bit questionable, the sub is so close man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#45 Intel Core</font>, the only man who has made so many glitches that his bottleneck for total time is his no glitch times once again cleaned up the no glitch times. However, his MH is still a 1:45.5. Aaaaand he's back to his old ways and he's playing MC glitch and got 5th WW. I made <a href="https://imgur.com/a/9ksfvZ7" target="_blank">this meme</a> for him.<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Hunter Wells</font> started off by getting a low 1:19 on rSL but recently hopped on some no glitch, getting 2:00 on rPG, 1:31 on rMC and a 2:05.3 on rDS. Also 39.000 on rDS flap, lol!<br><br><font color=yellow>#47 JAYOO</font> fucking hates the new rSL glitch and says it's his least favourite glitch. What is wrong with him. He got a 1:20.9 on it. He also got a 49 on MC glitch on the same day that the new lap 1 strat was found out (he did not use this strat.) And the BGM that he used for that is called: "Aborting the Sloughing Seance: Frantic Body Disposal Ankle​-​Deep in the Accumulative Filth of Seven Semi​-​Liquified Corpses I" from the hit album "Exquisite Macerated Tissue Slippage and Full-Body Degloving Under Extreme Circumstances of Accelerated Putrefaction". Therapy is always an option, mi amico Lombardo.<br><br><font color=yellow>#50 Jacob Loerzel</font> has made it into the top 50!! Ultra_Pear could never. He also got a rSL 2/3 (getting tired of saying this over and over and over again) and some rDS flap. Good job Invincible! And don't think I wouldn't mention your sign clip prowess in this news update aswell, you still have the BKT on it!<br><br><font color=yellow>#58 JMM435</font> got a 2/3 on rSL (zzzzzzzzzzzzzz) although it beats me so I can't really hate on it. Also a bunch of no glitch times, getting him closer to top 50.<br><br><font color=yellow>#59 Nate Schultz</font> 1:29 rSL, which is a large shame considering his absolutely legendary 1:42.0 2/3 run is no longer his PR. Big sad. Rest of the times he set are very NPC level.<br><br><font color=yellow>#63 Ultra_Pear</font> ahhh finally someone who didn't play rSL... NVM it's just ultra pear who just isn't able to get one. In fact, he didn't even PR at all since the last news update, but I thought roasting him was so funny that I don't wanna remove it now. Tough!<br><br><font color=yellow>#66 Alex Shoal</font> got the rPG flap WR, it's so funny to me that KingAlex after all these years has strats in this game that literally only he ever plays. Man's gonna be 107 years old sitting in a retirement home grinding out his rPG tree clip flap while Carter's grandson is trying to optimize the no-sc WR a tiny bit more because KingAlex came back 7 years after Carter's death to destroy the family legacy once again<br><br><font color=yellow>#74 Filler</font> came back after all this time to become a major league shitposter, but also prove to everyone that he isn't washed. He achieved 2nd Circumnavigational on rSL with a 2:03.8. Also like, uhh, a lot of other stuff. MH 1:43.1, KC 2:18.6, rWS 1:49.5+2nd ww flap. He also did a bunch of research with Thomas van Deerse to make the red chart champs page happen, arigato Paul-san<br><br><font color=yellow>#78 Owen Smith</font> is the MAN OF THE HOUR. He pulled through on another one of his odyssean grinds, with a RR 2/3 glitch run. Bro really went from having to quit his 58 grind because his parents didn't let him play MKW to getting 2/3 on RR, screaming his fucking lungs out and having his GF run into the room and congratulate him on the run. Man is living the degen speedrunner dream and I couldn't be happier for him. He has already set his sights for CM fast entry as his next grind, which should hopefully not be as carcinogenic as the RR 2/3 one.<br><br><font color=yellow>#82 ArthurOww</font> got a 1:22.202 on MC which makes it into the top 100 on that track, amongst other times that may or may not make the top 100<br><br><font color=yellow>#84 Acquiesce</font> oh man is that a rSL 1/3 I see???? Haven't seen one of those for years am I right??? Ok yeah he also got a 1:29.4 DC + flap of course, as well as a random rPG flap!<br><br><font color=yellow>#92 StarBoi</font> got a 38.6 DKM glitch flap nice nice, also 2:00.2 BC3, you love to see PRs on that infernal category<br><br><font color=yellow>#95 NITROFOX</font> is our latest addition to the top 100, knocking out Nota! We are getting quite close to some legends getting knocked off the top 100, JimmyB and Swiss Alvin are hanging on by a thread, and we already lost Kezer. Surprise comeback to hold onto the top 100 spot anyone? Anyway NitroBozo got a boomerific 1/3 on rSL, as well as one of the most disgusting chokes of all time with a 1:22.001 on MC ng with a 25.1 lap 1 followed by 2 28.4 laps. He must feel that God himself wants to smite him, however he decided to put it much simpler than me, simply stating: "Not sigma"<br><br><font color=yellow>#96 Cederic</font> improved on RR ng and MC g flap. He also got a time of 1:39.3 on rSL, and I genuinely cannot tell if that is 1/3 or 2/3. OK it's 2/3. God help us all.<br><br><font color=yellow>#103 Chloie</font> it's another 1/3 on rSL, it seems to be the big hit around the #100 mark here. MF ACTUALLY GOT A FUCKING 1:43.001 rMR 3LAP AND A 32.000 FLAP, I AM DONE.<br><br><font color=yellow>#113 James Collins</font> was so nice when asking for a news update that he inspired me to actually write one. I wouldn't be here writing this if it wasn't for his message, but after like 4 hours of writing my opinion on James is starting to sour a bit... Okok let's see here: MC3 1:18.825 with loads of potential for more, some classic shroomstrat nonsense on rBC and the eventual return to 1-1-1, been there. Alvin van Asselt bop for James this month, making moves.<br><br><font color=yellow>#115 Supreme</font> got a 1/3 rSL, simply stating: "lol". Guessing it's not the proudest run for him. On BC3 he got a 44.6 flap, stating: "cba to crop enjoy". Something's telling me that this guy doesn't have the highest energy levels.<br><br><font color=yellow>#123 Carlo</font> got PBs on rMC and rBC sc nice<br><br><font color=yellow>#125 Mystogan</font> was busy uploading that video of every 200cc flap WR that I regret to say that I watched all the way from start to finish at work while brainrotting, don't tell my boss. He also played some 150cc, cutting over 10 AF and 9 spots. <br><br><font color=yellow>#166 Andrew Grieve</font> the absolute legend got a 1:49.5, how did I not hear about this? Hell yeah brother<br><br><font color=yellow>#169 Dwt89_</font> got a 1:18.2 on rSL, a rare 2/3 this low down on the charts. Clearly an indication of potential. Is that a first 1:09 on LC I see? AND rYF sub 1? Practically an initiation month for our young lad here, you are now a real degenerate, welcome aboard.<br><br><font color=yellow>#172 Falco</font> finally got his 3rd WW on rWS, making Yang's "beat Falco on every track" grind a rather funny meme.<br><br><font color=yellow>#177 ElecTrick</font> got a ton on runs but the one he decided was good enough to upload was a 2:19.880 on MT. Daelyn apparently chugged a pint in commemoration of that run. This is Irish MKW culture right here.<br><br><font color=yellow>#181 Anonymous</font> again just like last time, won't mention any of his times to protect his identity. Good job on avoiding the CIA this month also.<br><br><font color=yellow>#182 Silicosis</font> rSL 1/3 classic classic and like 20 times in August to get him into the top 200<br><br><font color=yellow>#185 Kitty</font> got 2 very simple times. 1:14.2 on rPB and 1:00.2 on rYF. Subs are rather close.<br><br><font color=yellow>#186 Brian Lai</font> got a funny 35.558 on WGM no glitch flap, beating my time by 1 ms, which I then proceeded to beat back by 1ms with a .557 before I got my .4 there. Mostly 3lap other than that it seems. Some nice times in there<br><br><font color=yellow>#187 Thomas Ullrich</font> didn't only set his legendary GV flap, but also sent in new times on LC and MMM on both 3lap and flap. This looks like the beginnings of a grand plan to overhaul his entire timesheet...<br><br><font color=yellow>#189 Daelyn</font> oooo is that a 1:09 LC I see very nice very nice and yes oh my it's a 2/3 on rSL! oh yeah this is the one with the legendary nightcore feel this moment BGM. Also 52.8 MC g 3/3 woodless, rPB 1:07 and 10th EU on RR glitch, this is like looking at my 2018 self living the glitch grind, refreshing to see<br><br><font color=yellow>#193 Will Fury</font> oh wtf another 2/3 on rSL uhhh and to contrast that a 2:02 on CM. <br><br><br><font color=red>People who are below Rhodechill</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#216 Darien Bawpers</font> bro only bawp will hop onto a new rSL discovery and come out with a stupid ahh 2:00 time on it, well at least he's still the only person on earth who can do DKM shroomless glitch so his ego won't be hurt too much by me roasting him for being ABSOLUTELY FUCKING SLOW<br><br><font color=yellow>#222 Hockeylord900</font> oh damn 59.4 rYF, love it<br><br><font color=yellow>#225 Sam Fairless</font> was on fire that one night we all played rSL glitch in call, and he ended up with a 1:22.3 on that. He also got a 1:33.5 on DKJP glitch, and then played like a few random flaps and shit<br><br><font color=yellow>#232 Woomy</font> got 59 on rYF hell yeah, LC 1:09+rYF 59 check, welcome to timetrialhood<br><br><font color=yellow>#243 Joe Beaton</font> got a 3/3 on rSL with a 1:09.4 and dropped a fucking banger of a video that made me laugh out loud, great to be able to have a laugh about stupid ass drama from years ago and look back on the simpler times with joy. He also got a big improvement on CM ng, skipping straight to a 1:55.4. Big popoffs this month for sure<br><br><font color=yellow>#245 Zyxis</font> bopped such legends of the game as Jared Black, Anis Taktak and my old 2014 clanmate and facebook friend Julian Stephens who I am eagerly waiting to come back to this game!<br><br><font color=yellow>#258 Tristan Kelley</font> continues his Sisyphean grind of beating Falco on every track, he's up to 16 now! He also has no more Intermediate times now (wow that's crazy I never thought he would be able to do that no way) His natural state right now seems to be grinding rYF and listening to podcasts, he's up to a 59.3 now but he choked Falco bop at the end :(<br><br><font color=yellow>#265 Ivan Andreopoulos</font> finished his timesheet, welcome welcome<br><br><font color=yellow>#287 Mikey Mickey Mike Mikeson</font> again who is this goofy ahh player, I see he got 2:18 on MT, nice nice, grats on the first top 100 time!<br><br><font color=yellow>#300 Thomas Placella</font> His other info field just says "Thomas Placella" and his proof status is Screenshot/Time scroll in the year of our lord 2024. Maybe weirdest profile on the PP? He also hasn't played in like 3 years and now drops a random 47.8 RR flap and nothing else? Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I see that GV flap, this is Tubiek, welcome back to the land of the living my fellow GoldenEye community loving comrade<br><br><font color=yellow>#302 Ncsr.</font> 1:14.8 rPB and 33.0 MG flap. What is the reason for these 2 specific categories being the only ones you improve on this month?<br><br><font color=yellow>#308 Skylar Waffle</font> I've been watching breaking bad on the side while grinding DKS and man this guys name is exactly how I feel about Skyler, stop yapping to sigma Walter please.<br><br><font color=yellow>#311 Charlie Brennan</font> finished his timesheet, welcome Charlie<br><br><font color=yellow>#315 Connor GB</font> improved on DC and rSL ng.<br><br><font color=yellow>#334 .VNix</font> the absolute gigabozo submitted times and forgot to actually write down the times. I've seen people forget decimals all the time, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone actually forget to submit the actual fucking time, ggs. Again, all his times are with kart so I don't actually know anything, all I can say is that haha funny .069 on CM and 2:27.4 on RR is quite nice (although what kind of absolute drongo gets a 2:27.4 on RR and the thing they put in the description is "55th Kart as of upload date", that's so goofy)<br><br><font color=yellow>#359 Pablo Hernangómez</font> got a 1:18.3 on MC3 and a 1:53.6 on GV, well done pablito<br><br><font color=yellow>#379 Hollend78</font> cut over 167 AF and like 135 positions, biggest AF cut by quite a lot this month<br><br><font color=yellow>#394 ChromaQ</font> MG glitch 14.169 flap. These news update farms are getting more and more desperate each time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#406 Dudu.</font> ok cool stuff such as 1:09 LC, 59.7 rYF, but it seems that recently rYF flap has been his life goal, getting down to a 18.486 there (which to be fair is pretty damn good), the Brazilians are finally finding MKW and bringing their culture of grinding weird stuff into the mix, bem-vindos todos os brasileiros! Bro there is an actual internet forum up for Brazilian and Portuguese top 10s that is still actively getting updated, complete with 15 year old facebook and twitter logos to share the site, not gonna lie I'm kinda tempted to move to Brazil at the moment<br><br><font color=yellow>#423 Chansey</font> set some times that showed a lack work ethic ('go fast' rather than 'do it right') which, in a Petersonian sense elevates sexual archetypes in the marketplace ('fastest monkey')<br><br><font color=yellow>#431 Ben Yafe</font> finished his timesheet!<br><br><font color=yellow>#460 Calum Sutherland</font> yeah we've officially set the part of the news update where I've been typing for over 5 hours and seeing times that are pretty similar to my PBs from 10 years ago when I didn't know what delay drifting meant, I'm sure you can do better than this!<br><br><font color=yellow>#496 Vincent Kwiecien</font> 1:33 MG glitch, 1:28 WGM glitch, 34 GV glitch, a collection of LukeGB ahh runs<br><br><font color=yellow>#516 Charlotte Crego</font> hey yo what's up it's me flanders with a 1:16 on rPB, the day is saved<br><br><font color=yellow>#524 Russell Horwood</font> a collection of exclusively flap times in the #500 range, lovely job, come back next month<br><br><font color=yellow>#531 Dovo4</font> completed his timesheet, and did so nicely<br><br><font color=yellow>#553 Joshua Patterson</font> omg his rYF flap has a video and it's the only one on his timesheet, let's peek the vid, I see first hero time but Joshua is also a top 70 MKDD player, welcome to the zoomer MK!<br><br><font color=yellow>#566 James Woods</font> seems to be cancelled by Hollywood which is a true shame, he put up some incredibly performances back in the day in Videodrome and Once Upon A Time in America. Oh wait no wrong James Woods, this one got a 2:10 on rSL.<br><br><font color=yellow>#578 NE MKPatsfan</font> finished their timesheet with an MMM flap, idk if that has EVER been the last category missing on anyone's timesheet in history. Also bro aint nobody on the player's page forum anymore, if you actually want to talk to people get on the discord BOZO<br><br><font color=yellow>#581 Diana M</font> thank you for the bible quote. I think you could overtake James Woods soon.<br><br><font color=yellow>#625 Zooms</font> got a 2:21.8 on BC3 SC. Yeah, SC. I kinda wanna see this run<br><br><font color=yellow>#628 Charles Schrader</font>got a 1:58 on TF and a 1:22.8 on MC3. Fascinating. Only 6 people left, you can do it<br><br><font color=yellow>#630 Borat</font> again welcome to MKW mr. borat your times are-a very nice but it's all muddle to my brain, however I peeked your MKDD timesheet and you're kinda highkey a god gamer so there you go<br><br><font color=yellow>#636 Phenom</font> is not going to be a phenom in the MKW community with these times, I am calling it right now.<br><br><font color=yellow>#660 Flora Novia</font> 1:00 on CM glitch, this timesheet looks exactly like mine did in 2013 after just having watched Troy's Coconut mall Olympics vide, which was apparently uploaded on the 10 day anniversary of 9/11 and the supremely tragic day when the great Finnish national hero Kukko Pärssinen was brutally murdered by vicious huskies while defending his women, I will link a tribute to him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW9q80Sxt9g" target="_blank">here</a> so his memory shall live on for a little bit longer.
