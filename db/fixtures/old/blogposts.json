Also, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the main updater for this site, William \"Susan\" \"Peach\" Lacey. It is my understanding that Lacey has graciously volunteered his time to keep the news and times for this site up to date. I'm sure his wit, all around gaming talent and girlish charm will make for an enjoyable experience for everyone involved. I would also like to thank everyone who has volunteered to help out, whether it be with translations, proof moderation or time updating. Withouth all of your help this would not be possible.<br><br>The game has only been released in Europe, Asia and South America for a few weeks and is due out in North America in about 10 days so there may be a bit of a slow start. Regardless, when you get your times submit them to the yahoo group and we'll take care of the rest.<br><br>With that said, I wish everyone happy karting.<br><br>-Mark<br><br>P.S. Alex will be out of town for a little while so development of new features or fixing of bugs may have to wait until he gets back.</p>",

This week is markedly different.</b><br><br><font color=cyan><b>Don't do what Donny Nintendon't does</b></font><br>So yesterday we discovered a nice Shortcut on Grumble Volcano. This improved the quality of this Time Trial track by about 700%. Mostly because the annoying jump over the lava whilst bouncing on the rock part was now completely unnecessary, and it also removed the need to perform any Lakitu glitches. This was all well and good until Nintendo decided to delete times. Now this in itself is fine. If you want to have a policy for what times are allowed, and what times aren't, then you're entitled to enforce it.<br>The problem of course, is that Nintendo seemed to have no idea what they were doing, and 24 hours later, they still don't know. They randomly deleted a few times yesterday, but not all. They picked one or two people to remove at random, whilst leaving other people's times perfectly intact. If you're going to have a policy, then enforce it. If you're not going to enforce it properly, or if you can't, then leave it alone. It's that simple. Until they decide what to do, feel free to keep sending in SC times to the site. If you have the option to use a different licence, that might be a good idea too, so that you can keep track of both old and new times (if we need to switch back to the old). Perhaps they deleted our times yesterday because our site was clearly dominating the track. We'll see if it makes any difference now that there are 5 Japanese karters in the top 10.<br><br><font color=cyan><b>Going for a Kruise in the Desert</b></font><br>With all the grumbling going on yesterday, you'd be forgiven for forgetting that we had yet another breakthrough stratwise with another course this week on Dry Dry Ruins. Using the path to the right of the start/finish straight, you can now set much faster flap times by using 1 of 2 methods. The first involves the bowser bike and doubleshrooming around the bend in between the water and the pyramid. The second involves the Magikruiser and singleshrooming to the right of the water. Both strats are faster than the previous methods, and both need to be explored more fully in the coming weeks. And hopefully Nintendo won't decide that we're simply going too fast for their liking. (But since they don't care about Flap times anyway, I wouldn't worry too much).<br><br><font color=cyan><b>Site Records</b></font><br>Big winners this week were <font color=yellow><b>Mickael Smolen</b></font>, <font color=yellow><b>Cole Gilbert</b></font> and <font color=yellow><b>Alvin van Asselt</b></font>.

A separate chart for Non-sc/Mini-Sc/Hopping-over-the-lava-using-a-rock-isn't-really-a-Sc may be created in the future, but that will be decided at another time.<br>Good work to <b>Shaun Tanney, Matt Ellis, and Mark Schmidt</b> for representing us well and pushing this new shortcut to its limits.</b><br><br><font color=cyan><b>The Norton Six</b></font><br>There were a number of players these last few days who made absolutely 0 cut to their AF.

A raid of the house took place shortly after 7pm last night, and it was there that the shocking discovery was made.<br><br>Twenty seven girls were found having a secret meeting, all wearing name tags with the karter they've been impersonating on them.

At least for a while. To avoid dropping AF points, everyone in the 30-50 range should aim to improve 0.500 per day to break even and counteract those passing you. That increases to nearly 1 full point per day when you drop down near the 100 mark, but only around 0.300 near the top. The general message is that the higher up you go, the slower you fall back down. It's also why those who focus on getting really fast times on certain tracks tend to fall slower than those who try to improve only their worst times.<br>Anyway, all this rambling on doesn't help anyone, and I have a hot date tonight.<br><br><font color=cyan><b>1-16</b></font><br>Alvin and Michael declared a truce this week.

This is the first time we've been this high, and hopefully we can push on now to reach 40% over the next month or two.

This is great news. Unfortunately only 165 of those have a full 64 times submitted. I guess this is to be expected due to the lap times issue. 49 players have submitted exactly 32 times (Guess which 32?). :) If any new players are reading this, if you want to be appear on the stats charts, do try to get those lap times in to us, even if they're only 1 try times. Some good moves and progress are doubtless being missed in these updates due to those times being missing. Take <font color=yellow> Jose Manuel Camacho Ortega</font> for instance, who with only 32 times would *still* be ranked in the top 100 even if the other 32 were all in last place, because his 3lap times are so good.<br><br><font color=cyan>Mover of the week</font><br>The biggest move this week goes to <font color=yellow> Pierre Ruffin </font> who passed a full 22 players to break into the top 100 and finish 82nd.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><font color=yellow>James Pierrepont</font> took both LC records this week with style, bringing the course time to <font color=magenta>1'09\"697</font> and the lap to <font color=magenta>21\"941</font><br><font color=yellow>Brendan Payne </font> snatched away Aubrey's WGM course record and brought it to <font color=magenta>1'53\"494</font><br><font color=yellow>Santiago Munoz </font> beat Mickaels Maple Treeway course record.

The reason for the change is that I want to reflect that higher times should be rewarded more. For instance, a top 10 where our players are 1-9 with a non-site player at 10 is much much better than a top 10 where our players are 2-10 and a non-site player is 1. With the first situation, we need just one more player to have a complete domination, but with the 2nd, 10 of our players must beat the top guy to dominate.<br>I've rambled on enough about that.

        "content": "<p><b>This will be an update dealing with changes between the 1st and 21st of January<br><br>First off, let me talk about these news updates. I realise how frustrating it can be sometimes when you play the game, get some decent PRs, and then never get mentioned. This is mainly due to the overwhelming activity we get here at the site. For instance, if I was to mention everyone who was active in this update, I'd have to talk about 105 players. Nobody has that sort of time, and nobody would want to read it all anyway. Also, I usually only talk about players who have submitted a full set of times to us. So the 250 people who haven't sent in those missing times will probably never get a mention. It sucks, but this is the way it is.<br><br><font color=cyan>10% rule</font><br>So for this update only, I'm going to only talk about moves from players who cut at least 10% off their AF. Why 10%? No reason at all. I'll deal with people from lowest ranked, to highest ranked.<br>So let's start off with <font color=yellow>Daniel Boettcher</font>. Daniel passed 37 players on his way to 112th spot. He should break into the top 100 soon.  <font color=yellow>Jon Ho</font> is even closer to the top 100, passing 31 players to reach 109th. Breaking that barrier though is <font color=yellow>Tom Norton</font> of Coconut Mall fame. Yes, he's a double Site record holder. Yes he's 99th. Respect.<br><br>As we rise up through the ranks, we meet <font color=yellow>Fintan Kelly</font>. Fintan was outside the top 100 last update, but broke through with style, kicking 21 players aside on his journey to 85th. Good work. <font color=yellow>Jose Karica</font> is rising steadily, making a move from #79 to #72. <font color=yellow>Michele Magnaterra</font> is doing even better, moving from #78 to #69. <font color=yellow>Julian Grassberger</font> is doing better than both of those, with a 10-man move #76 -> #66, and <font color=yellow>Robert Lee</font> is doing better than all of those, taking out 13 unlucky players on his way to #61. <Br><br>Two players on the periphery of the top 50, made some excellent upward movement. <font color=yellow>Ted Kim</font> shows no mercy, dispatching everyone in his way to 54th spot, whilst <font color=yellow>Carlos Morales</font> makes light work of a total of 17 players. He finishes just outside the top 50 at #52 this week.<Br><br>Now we get into the serious business of the top 25, with <font color=yellow>Sam Hoar</font> blasting through to #24 from #31. <font color=yellow>Daniel Anderson</font> makes an impressive move into the top 10, with a move from #14 to #8. <font color=yellow>Nick Meade</font> continues to impress with his relentless move up the charts. This time out he's up from #10 to #6. And finally, <font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney</font> sends in some strong times to pass Lewis for 4th place.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site records</font><br>Starting us off this week is <font color=yellow>Joonas Ryhanen</font> He joins with both Mushroom Gorge records.

After over 200+ days dominance from Alvin, someone finally does enough to pass him for that #1 spot. For over half a year, people had risen fast and fallen at the final hurdle, but not this time. The title switches back across the Atlantic to the USA for the first time since Michael Fried's reign in August of last year. How long will it stay there? Only time will tell. Great job David!<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Everyone in the top 20 was active this update, except for Lewis, Michael and Sam, but most of the movement was of the running backwards kind. Like when you're on a treadmill and it's just going faster than you can keep up with it. Only a few managed to excel despite the natural drag backwards. <font color=yellow>Alex Shoal</font> was one. He broke into the top 10 for the first time, moving from 13th to 8th. <font color=yellow>Marc Bas</font> also made some fine progress by getting closer to the top 10. He moves up 3 places from 15th to 12th. <font color=yellow>Leif Leopold</font> climbs a further 4 places to finish in 14th spot. The last big move in the top 20 came from <font color=yellow> Gary Marcoz </font>, who climbed an amazing 30 places to finish at 18th, cutting his AF in two in the process.<br><br><font color=cyan>Further movement of awesomeness</font><br>Awesomeness outside the top 20 is defined by a 10% cut to AF, or a 5 place gain. Both or either. You can also be awesome by doing other stuff, but I likely won't talk about it. I'm just mean like that.<br><font color=yellow>Emmanuel Debenest and Jason Smith</font> start us off by making very similar cuts and moving up at roughly the same speed. They both took over 8 points off their respective AF scores and finish in 21st and 24th respectively, honing in on the heady heights of top 20 fame. <br>Honing in on less heady heights is <font color=yellow>Andrew Tran </font>. The top 30 is pretty high. It's like being shot upwards from a cannon. You could probably see everyone's house from up there. Anyway, Andrew got shot up from one hell of a cannon, because he was 58th before this update, and now he's 32nd! <font color=yellow>Brendan Santin </font> has a definitely goal on his mind, and that's firstly to reach the top 50. He passed 20 people in total this update, including some old top 10 players. He's up from 73rd to 53rd. <font color=yellow> Anis Taktak </font> did something similar. In fact he did almost the exact same, passing 20 players too. He finishes exactly 60th, with a lot more to come. Newcomer <font color=yellow>Robert van Zanten </font>, joined 2 weeks ago at #103, but has very quickly moved up a full 36 places to #67 with a 25% cut to his AF.<br><font color=yellow>Dustin Enders </font> made a 2% improvement to his AF, but moved up 7 places to 65th. <font color=yellow> Greg Coffino </font> and <font color=yellow> Manuel Schmitz</font> moved up to 82nd and 83rd, passing 18 and 13 players respectively. <font color=yellow>Thomas Thomas </font> passed 9 to get to 89th. Rounding out the top 100 are two players who broke into it this week. <font color=yellow>Sean Longwill </font> came from 112th to finish 93rd, and <font color=yellow>Jon Coppernoll </font> rose from 101st to 94th. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>The rate records are being broken is predictably slowing as they get tougher and tougher. Still though, we've had some good activity over the last few weeks.<br><font color=yellow>James Pierrepont</font> retakes the LC record he lost briefly to Ashley last update. It sits now at<font color=magenta>1'09\"573</font><br><font color=yellow>David McPartland </font> starts his run of record breaking with MC lap. He takes it to <font color=magenta>25\"592</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Pascua </font> improves his own DKS time to <font color=magenta>1'50\"820</font><br><font color=yellow>David McPartland </font> grabs another lap record. This time at Daisy Circuit: <font color=magenta>28\"681</font><br><font color=yellow>Leif Leopold </font> gets on the record board by lowering the DDR lap to <font color=magenta>34\"165</font><br><font color=yellow>David McPartland</font> third lap grab is on Moonview Highway.<font color=magenta> 33\"445</font><br><font color=yellow>Keiron Moseley</font> lowers his own Rainbow Road lap under 49. <font color=magenta>48\"988</font><br><font color=yellow>Alvin van Asselt </font> takes the YF lap down a peg to <font color=magenta>18\"629</font><br><font color=yellow>David McPartland </font> completes his set of laps by slipping fractionally under the MR lap record by 0.002. <font color=magenta>31\"802</font><br><font color=yellow>Gordon Sproul </font> asserts his dominance on SGB, by adding the lap to his 3lap. <font color=magenta>25\"799</font><br><font color=yellow>Alvin van Asselt</font> improves his own Delfino Square lap with a time of <font color=magenta>39\"231</font><br><font color=yellow>C.

But the most important move in the higher ranks this update was by <font color=yellow>Gary Marcoz</font>. Gary breaks into the top 10 at #9, having been #18 last update.

Not far behind is <font color=yellow>Mickael Houston</font> who joins the list at #20. Both of these players served to push down some of the more regular faces on our charts. Despite the 2 place drift, <font color=yellow>Stacy Needham</font> managed to gain a place with a decent cut. He's up to 25th now. <font color=yellow>Daniel Pascua</font> is up 6 full places, #49->#43. <font color=yellow>Anis Taktak</font> goes one better and passes 7 players on his way to #53. <font color=yellow>Robert van Zanten</font> completes a 10 place leap to climb to #57, whilst <font color=yellow>Brian Cook</font> climbs a few places to stay just ahead at #55.<br><font color=yellow>Dustin Enders, Leslie Wolf, Greg Coffino, Franco Gubser and Jon Coppernoll</font> all deserve a mention for climbing a couple of places each from 60->100, and <font color=yellow>Michelle Homan</font> finishes up at exactly #100, having started 8 places back at #108.

Nevertheless, people are gradually closing, although every single person in last update's top 10 lost AF points this update. However, there was a breakthrough into the top 10 from 13th spot in the shape of <font color=yellow>Michael Smolen</font> His 14 PRs were enough to gain him those vital 3 AF points. To break into the top 10 you only now need an AF of 19.59, which is the worst AF across any of the mariokart games and means just one thing. Too many people on the site do not have a full set of 64 times submitted to us. Only 252 players out of 575. That's just 43.8%.<br>It's been a quiet week in terms of positive movement. After Michael, we need to go all the way down to <font color=yellow>Alvin Le</font> in 17th, who moves up two places with 9 PRs. <font color=yellow>Carlos Eduardo</font> and <font color=yellow>Anis Taktak</font> put some real work in over the last 2 weeks, beating 25 and 26 of their own times respectively, which is difficult to do at that level. They move up to 35th and 37th. <font color=yellow>Eric Hacksell</font> breaks into the top 40, at 40 with some nice improvements.<br>Then for a long time nothing happens, until we reach the 60s and 70s. Here we have 2 mini-battles. The first between <font color=yellow>Michael van der Willik</font> and <font color=yellow>Greg Coffino</font>. Both these guys started in the 70s and moved to the 60s this update. The 2nd is between <font color=yellow>Jon Coppernoll</font> who with 11 PRs moved up to 76th, and <font color=yellow>David Schiering</font>, a site champion of old who dropped out of the top 100 recently, but who is working his way back up. He's now just a spot behind Jon in 77th. <font color=yellow>Enrique Walander</font> is out on his own, scoring a 10 place gain from 100th to 90th.

The gap between them and the leader last time around was 4 AF points. This has been halved to just over 2. Another improvement like that by any of Shaun or Nick could result in a new champion.<br>That wasn't the only action in the top 10 though, as <font color=yellow>#7 James Richards and #8 Brendan Payne</font> both picked up a place. <font color=yellow>#10 Ben Hart</font> broke into the top 10 with his 16 PRs.<br>Some token effort was made in the teens, but only <font color=yellow>#18 Jamie Disley</font> made any progress, moving up from #21 last time out. <font color=yellow>#22 Tyler McNell</font> is the person in the top 50 who made the most unique PRs, with 26, which was enough to move him up a spot and helps him on his way to cross the chasm which is the road from 25->20. That's a full 15 AF point journey. <br><font color=yellow>#27 Fabien Jacques</font> is our impressive highest new entry to the site. Some great opening times from him including a WR on Maple Tree lap. <br><font color=yellow>#29 Markus Hobelsberger</font> breaks into the top 30 with an 8 place move from #37. <br><font color=yellow>#31 Robert van Zanten</font> also impresses by moving up 8 spots to finish just outside the top 30 this week.<br>The biggest move in the top 50 goes to <font color=yellow>Yannick Wenger</font>. Coming from #58, he makes a 13 place gain!<br><br><font color=yellow>#52 Tim van Ham</font> and <font color=yellow>#52 David Long</font> are both battling to break into the top 50, with some great cuts. <font color=yellow>#73 Franco Gubser</font> and <font color=yellow>#74 Salvatori Bellusci</font> both made over 20 PRs and are moving up nicely on the list.<br><br>2 more players joined in the top 100 this week, those are <font color=yellow>#88 Sophie Steiner</font> and <font color=yellow>#98 Joseph Knighton</font>. Great job to both of you! Sophie is now our female champion.<br><br>Outside the top 100, <font color=yellow>#102 Yannick Wiesner</font> closes quickly on the top 100 with 28 PRs. <font color=yellow>#111 Thibaud Bourdeau </font> makes an 18 place move to put himself into contention too.<br>Rounding out the news are <font color=yellow>#132 Nicholas Harvey</font> and <font color=yellow>#149 Agustin Berrios </font>. Nick made the most PRs of anyone with a grand total of 44, to move him up an impressive 28 places, whist Agustin passed a heck of a lot of players, 35 in total.<br><br>Good job everyone. :)</p>",

Practically all of them. Some even played some Mariokart Wii, although they were mostly stationary doing that. Some of those PR'd and some of those PR'd impressively enough to leapfrog people on the site. <br>The top 20 PR'd 106 times between them. 14 of those belonged to <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font>, who bested David's 7 to close the gap in AF slightly. It also put a small amount of daylight between himself and Shaun who slips to 3rd. <font color=yellow>#5 James Richards</font> maintained the same AF he had in the previous update, and whilst doing that managed to pass both Alvin and Alex who succombed to natural AF-drift.<br><font color=yellow>#11 Cole Gilbert</font> is now so close to #10 that he could theoretically break the top 10 without doing anything, but that eventually leads to dropping out of the top 100 after a long enough time period and isn't to be advised. <font color=yellow>#14 Mark Schmidt</font> had a good week with a two place hop, whilst <font color=yellow>#16 Jamie Disley</font> does a great job leaping from #20 this week. <font color=yellow>#19 Joe Sebeny</font> rounds out the top 20 in non-literal fashion, by moving up two spots from #21<br><br>Outside the top 20, where the bad players lie, we have some nice movement too. They're not really bad, they're just misunderstood. <font color=yellow>#23 Jason Smith</font> for instance, cut 8 AF points with 22 PRs, and passed 2 people. In his wake is <font color=yellow>#24 James Farlour</font>. James was #24 before this update, and still #24 after it. Given the Smith effect, you'd expect him to be lower, but he also made 22 PRs and passed LC expert Pierrepont. 2 players who aren't LC experts, <font color=yellow>#26 Andy Lundeen</font> and <font color=yellow>#27 Markus Hobelsberger</font> shuffled quietly past Fabien Jacques when he wasn't looking. <br><font color=yellow>#30 Stacy Needham</font> who is one of the few people we can be sure didn't lie about his name, jumped 5 spots this week. That's more than anyone above him, and less than a few below, but we don't speak about them.<br><br>Speaking of players below Stacy, <font color=yellow>#37 Dustin Enders</font> made a nice 21 PR move to put him into striking distance of quite a number of players. <font color=yellow>#40 Joshua Leutz</font> and <font color=yellow>#41 Eric Hacksell</font> get an honourable mention for having nice scrabble last names, and rising up slightly on the AF list. <font color=yellow>#44 Pierre Dofine</font> is our highest addition to the AF list this update, appearing in a very respectable spot. Rounding out the top 50 Sebeny-style is <font color=yellow>#49 David Long</font>. He breaks the top 50 with a 4 place move, and will spend the next update trying to fix it before anyone notices.<br><br>In the dreaded wastelands below the top 50, where angels fear to tread, <font color=yellow>#54 Marco van Turner</font> blasts 26 PRs, and passes 9 players. These players may or not be dead. It is a wasteland afterall. One player who isn't dead, is <font color=yellow>#67 Greg Coffino</font>. With a name like that he should constantly be on a caffeine high. This may explain his even 10 place jump, or it may in fact be unrelated. Either way, it's pretty impressive. More impressive still is <font color=yellow>#74 Salvatore Bellusci</font> whose 13 PRs actually lost him AF points. It's hard to imagine that, but the AF-drift treadmill was set to \"eek\" this week. Another thing that's hard to imagine is women's champion <font color=yellow>#78 Sophie Steiner</font>. We all know that females can't play Kart, yet here she is climbing the top 100 list. Hopefully she can pass her secret on to other girls, and we can have more female karters highly ranked in future. <font color=yellow>#88 Joseph Knighton</font>, who may be a real knight beat 7 players in a joust but still has many more to go through before the King will allow him to marry his daughter. Rounding out the top 100 in classic style is <font color=yellow>#99 Yannick Wiesner</font>. 14 PRs was enough to get him past 5 players to cement his status as a top 100 player.<br><br>The rest. What can we say about everyone below the wasteland in the pit of despair that is the 100+ ranks. I'm sure it smells. 3 players holding their noses and trying to escape up a makeshift rope are <font color=yellow>#104 Agustin Berrios</font>, who made short work of 36 players, <font color=yellow>#108 CousCous</font> who adopted a fake name (and who wouldn't in the pit), and slaughtered 37 players, and <font color=yellow>#116 Nicholas Harvey</font>, who made more PRs than almost anyone with 34 this week.<br><br>Last but not least, (least are the players who don't have 64 times submitted, and there's a metric ton of those), are <font color=yellow>#124 Zack Weber</font> and <font color=yellow>#226 Clay McElveen</font>. Both deserve honourable mentions for improving a full half of their PRs, despite the bad smell in the pit of despair.<br><br>That's it for this week!</p>",

I took a look at a video and thought to myself, \"Hah, that looks simple\". So I took my copy of mkwii out of the attic (It was actually sitting in a bag under a pile of clothes, but attic sounds cooler), and decided to play for the first time this year. I merrily bopped my head along to the music on the menu screens, and selected GV2. Lights went out..I moved forward a bit....swivelled...boosted/shroomed/wheelied...hit the pole with a *thunk*.......and fell straight down.<br>After a billion attempts at this with much the same result (sometimes I fell in a different spot), I decided to play the course normally, and actually PR'd on both the flap and 3lap, but no biggie as I'm entrenched a long way into the pit of despair. But to sum up my thoughts on this, getting massive air time off that pole is just not possible, and all the videos I've seen, and the 10 players who have beaten the previous Site Record on this flap are clearly fake, and must be irradicated as soon as possible. <br>:cry:<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Welcome to:<br><font color=lime>Jonas <font color=orange>\"I just chucked extra letters into my last name\"</font> Natanaelsson, Sofie <font color=orange>\"Winner\" </font>Wimmer, Henrik <font color=orange>\"Vin\"</font> Distel, and Brandon <font color=orange>\"My name started off as one nationality and ended as another\"</font> Sansui</font><br><br><font color=cyan>New Records</font> <br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Luigi Circuit lap</font> time of 0'21\"826 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'21\"782</font><br><font color=yellow>Cookie Sancez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'12\"506 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'12\"200</font><br><font color=yellow>Aziz Abdullah </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'51\"363 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'51\"340</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> time of 2'21\"771 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'21\"624</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape lap</font> time of 0'44\"891 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'44\"774</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'12\"517 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'12\"477</font><br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach lap</font> time of 0'22\"556 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'22\"545</font><br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Yoshi Falls crs</font> time of 0'59\"473 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'59\"405</font><br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Yoshi Falls lap</font> time of 0'18\"526 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'18\"516</font><br><font color=yellow>Alvin Le </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 lap</font> time of 0'16\"604 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'15\"019</font><br>Honourable mentions have to go to the other 9 <font color=orange>*thunk* *wheeeee*</font> players who also landed this SC well enough to beat the non-sc WR: <br>Alex Shoal, Yorick Meeker, Eric Hacksell, Pepotti San, Greg Coffino, Tony Ruiz, Thibaud Bourdeau, Max Anossow, Joshua Reinshagen<br><font color=yellow>Marc Bas </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 DK's Jungle Parkway lap</font> time of 0'42\"231 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'42\"098</font><br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens lap</font> time of 0'38\"838 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"770</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br><font color=yellow>#1 David McPartland</font> didn't move this week. He's sitting at the top of the mountain, sipping some hot beverage. In fact he's been at the top for so long now that he's probably built himself a nice log cabin. I wish I had a log cabin. The 5 players behind him, all played. Unfortunately they played in such a way as to each end up with a worse AF than the last update, although still closer to the cabin. Someone not trying to defy the laws of physics is <font color=yellow>#8 Cole Gilbert</font>. He played, and shockingly improved his AF too. Up from 11th to return to the top 10 for the first time since...he left it the last time. <font color=yellow>#9 Ben Hart</font> moved up solidly from 10th, although he'll be a bit miffed to see the guy who was behind him, now in front of him, but at least his AF is better. This brings us back to those 5 from #2 to #6. Like most SC discoveries, anyone who doesn't master it will be subject to natural AF-drift. So for the next while, the field will be subject to GV2-drift. It's interesting to see though, that whilst anyone in the top 200 could theoretically beat the old SR, only 10 people have been able to hit a sweet time. If it was easier, it may have been a contributing factor to a change of Site Champion.<br><br>People who can only dream about being Site Champion are those sitting at base camp, looking up at the final climb through the top 10. One of these is <font color=yellow>#12 Alvin Le</font>. Alvin is our resident GV2 expert, nailing a time just over 15 seconds and making me sad. I fly through the air as gracefully as a brick doesn't. With the aid of his new WR, he moves up from unlucky 13th. Another player on the move is <font color=yellow>#16 Tyler McNell</font>. #16 Tyler McNell was once known as #21 Tyler McNell, but he didn't much like that. He PR'd like a maniac and moved up 5 spots. Up 2 spots this update is <font color=yellow>#22 Jimmy Benson</font>. I don't know what Jimmy's real name is. It's changed about 7 times in the last few weeks, and after the incident with Smith it all got a bit confusing, but Jimmy Benson seems like a good strong name. I might name a kid that someday. Then I'll beat the kid at mariokart and call him other names. Parenthood is probably a bad idea.<br><br>I decided this week that I was going to mention everyone who had moved up at least 1 spot on the AF top 100 list, and also everyone with a funny name. Then I thought about it and decided to do only the first one. Also I should point out that the AF chart change column, and my news update are pretty much never from/to the same dates, so if I leave people out, or if you think I have, it's probably just because I hate you. You should start a facebook campaign against me (P.S. Don't do that, or it will make me sad).<br><br>Next up is <font color=yellow>#28 Robert van Zanten</font>. Robert ninja'd his way into the top 30 last update without me noticing and just stealthed passed Fabien Jacques. Markus better keep his eyes open. Last time out <font color=yellow>#33 Dustin Enders</font> moved to within striking distance of a few players. This time around, he took those players out. And not, like, on a date. I mean in a mafia way. He probably killed them, I mean his name is Enders for crying out loud. It's what he does! Someone currently checking if they're still alive or not is <font color=yellow>#34 Anis Taktak</font>, whose Taktik was probably to pretend to be dead when Dustin passed him. Anis is up 2 spots this week. <font color=yellow>#37 Eric Hacksell</font> made a larger cut to his AF than most people above, except for Cole and Tyler, but Tyler was a maniac, and Cole was trying to bring sanity back to physics. Eric won't get a cool nickname this week, but he'll be happy with the 4 place move. Rounding out the top 40 in traditional style is <font color=yellow>#39 Tony Ruiz</font>. Tony is our highest new entry this week to the AF chart. Good job!<br><br>Then for a long time nothing happens, as if the space-time continuum has been shattered a little in this part of the AF chart. Suspicously, the one person able to move in this area is <font color=yellow>#47 David Long</font>, who broke the top 50 last time out, and has broken the spirits of all those around him currently. It's pretty devious, and nobody has moved out of the wastelands this time around.<br><br>Into the wasteland, and although bleak, there is some hope. <font color=yellow>#59 Ashley O'Hara</font> attempts to go with the wind, like his sister, but it only helps to move him up the one spot. Another player who is just trying his best (hey, I resisted making a hart joke earlier, let me have this), is <font color=yellow>#62 Justin Best</font>, up another spot this week. <font color=yellow>#66 Greg Coffino</font> continues his good form moving up a place, but there's a decent gap between him and the next group, and he has to pass through the valley of vultures before he gets there. <font color=yellow>#72 Salvatore Bellusci</font> is practicing for being in the top 10, by dropping AF points, but he moves up 2 spots this week. <font color=yellow>#76 Henrik Distel</font> and <font color=yellow>#77 Brandon Sansui</font> both join the site in the top 100, which is always an impressive feat. <br><br>Someone with impressive feet is <font color=yellow>#86 Joshua Reinshagen</font>. He ran past a full 7 players, and will take out a good few more if he keeps up the pace. Hunting him down is <font color=yellow>Leslie Wolf</font>. Leslie did a bit of a double act with <font color=yellow>#89 Joseph Knighton</font> this week by improving his AF, but losing spots. Both are still pointed in the right direction though. Joseph has a lance too. Lastly, congratulations to 2 players climbing out of the pit of despair this week. They are <font color=yellow>#93 Agustin Berrios</font> and <font color=yellow>#94 Alex Vandegrift</font>. It may be bleak at the tail-end of the top 100, and there may be vultures up ahead, but damn, it sure doesn't smell too bad.<br><br>Sometimes at night, if you listen hard enough, you can make out the wailing coming from the pit of despair. It's a place only spoken of in whispers around campfires late at night. Once the pit has you....<br>One player has one hand solidly on wasteland soil. His grip is fierce, and he no longer needs the rope for support. <font color=yellow>#101 Du Bois</font>, who is shedding his \"pit\" name CousCous now that he smells freedom. He clambered feverishly past 7 players, kicking them as he went by on the rope and watching as 5 others fell from the wasteland into the pit behind him. Someone up to where he was last week is <font color=yellow>#108 Nicholas Harvey</font>. Nicholas shows no sign of letting up, with a huge 34 PRs last week, he throws in another 27 this week to move up 8 places. Not wanting to be outdone, <font color=yellow>#109 Max Anossow</font> does something inexplicable, and passes 22 players with 20 PRs. At the bottom of the rope that dangles down to #120, is <font color=yellow>#117 Andrew Manning</font>, who made an extra effort, by passing 6 players when he saw light from above.<br>Lastly, forgotten, deep within the hellish tunnels and caverns that sprawl out from the bottom of the pit is the moving blur of <font color=yellow>#186 Florian Chollet</font>. Florian clearly saw something so terrifying that he wasted no time passing 59 players to get away from it. One can only imagine the horrors that lie beyond....<br><br></p>",

Not only is he safely in the #1 spot, but he pulled away from the field this week. The field is now very far away and has lots of cows in it, which is secretly his one weakness, but since he lives on top of a mountain, that weakness is a bit Moot.<br><br><img src=\"http://www.mariokart64.com/mkw/images/mkw2.jpg\"><br><br>The rest of the top ten were pretty static apart from a slight upward climb from <font color=yellow>#8 Cole Gilbert</font>, who'll be hoping not to get any coal this Christmas, unless....well...the reasons I said above. I didn't really go and think about what I did. I never learn. Anyway, Cole got a little closer to the 3 players in a bunch ahead of him. Apart from Cole, the rest totalled just 10 PRs between them but most of them just slept on the slope for a bit.<br><br><img src=\"http://www.mariokart64.com/mkw/images/mkw3.jpg\"><br><br>The people near the base of the mountain were having a bit of a relaxing time too. Maybe spending time watching cheesy Christmas movies instead of the important serious business of mariokarting. I'm presuming that one of them had a portable TV with him. I once saw a movie with Tom Hanks in it from the 80s where he had a TV built into his watch. Nobody believes me, but I saw it, and it was awesome. The watch, not the movie. <br>So whilst people were distracted, <font color=yellow>#18 Joe Sebeny</font> took full advantage and PR'd a whole massive twice, to pass Gary. Someone who has forgotten it's Christmas, and was PRing 8 and a half times more than Joe, was <font color=yellow>#20 Jimmy Benson</font>, who has the same name this week as he did last week, which makes me happy. He moves from the green pastures to the base of the mountain. Good job!<br><br><img src=\"http://www.mariokart64.com/mkw/images/mkw4.jpg\"><br><br>Some say the pasture is the best place to be. It's not as depressing as the wastes. It's not as smelly as the pit. It's not as cold as the mountain. It strikes a nice balance between being good at the game, and not being obsessive with it. And that's all well and good, but nobody remembers the guy who stayed in the pasture when Edmund Hillary climbed Everest. His name was Bob...Bob something or other. So enjoy the sunshine while it lasts, but know that I'm secretly disappointed in you. <br>One person true to form this week is <font color=yellow>#27 Robert van Zanten</font>. I told Markus to keep his eyes open in the last update, but Robert got the best of him anyway. However, now a threat to Robert's upward momentum is coming from right behind. <font color=yellow>#28 Anis Taktak</font> who reversed..uh...the ehmm..let me start that again. <font color=yellow>#28 Anis Taktak</font>, who turned the tables on Dustin this week, also managed to pass the Markus too and 4 other players. Whilst <font color=yellow>#32 Dustin Enders</font> did actually move up this week, he was also passed by a very rapidly moving <font color=yellow>#31 Eric Hacksell</font>, who is either a serial killer, or a salesman, or both! I personally think if he teamed up with Enders, they'd make a good double-act. Hacking, Ending, Dusting, Selling. It could work! <font color=yellow>#41 Joshua Leutz</font> moved passed Debenest whilst walking backwards this week, which made Emmanuel feel bad about himself. Finally, came a move which can only be described as epic. <font color=yellow>#44 Brandon Sansui</font> somehow managed to escape the wastes this week, even though he was well behind the valley of vultures when it started. I can only assume he somehow managed to hitch a ride on one of them and fly all the way to the pasture.  You'll like it here Brandon. It's nice and warm, and there's a river!<br><br><img src=\"http://www.mariokart64.com/mkw/images/mkw5.jpg\"><br><br>I don't know if they celebrate Christmas in the wastes, but I have a feeling they probably don't. Although if you could catch a vulture it might sort of taste like turkey or something like that. Someone just about escaping from the vultures this week is <font color=yellow>#61 Justin Best</font>, who passes two dormant players in Pascua and Will and casually points them out to the vultures.  Then we have some big news. <font color=yellow>#68 Rachel Emerson</font> becomes our new female champion with a crazy 39 place move all the way from #107. Good job Rachel! Way to represent! <br>Someone who has just about started his climb is <font color=yellow>#72 Henrik Distel</font>, who appeared from nowhere last week through a magic portal of mystery. He obviously forgot to close it after him, because following him this week is, <font color=yellow>#73 Ricardo Costa</font>, who is our highest new entry to the AF chart. Another person escaping the pit this week is <font color=yellow>#86 David Lee</font>, who passed 16 players with just 8 PRs, which breaks math. You may need to change your name to Bruce and fight Chuck Norris. Honourable mentions to <font color=yellow>#92 Agustin Berrios</font> and <font color=yellow>#95 Luke Glendinningeninning</font> Really? That's the name just just keeps on giving. Anyway, they both moved up some vital spots to keep them out of the pit.  The sweet taste of victory goes to <font color=yellow>#99 Du Bois</font> this week, who proves he's too strong for the pit. And finally, following on his coat tails (what?), is <font color=yellow>#100 Yannick Wiesner</font>. He does just enough to snatch a top 100 spot. Great work all round people!<br><br><img src=\"http://www.mariokart64.com/mkw/images/mkw6.jpg\"><br><br>The passage of time means nothing for those in the pit. Do they know it's Christmas time at all? No. Not even a nice turkey-vulture to eat in there. Two people keeping their spirits up though are <font color=yellow>#108 Max Anossow</font> and <font color=yellow>#109 Thibaud Bourdeau</font>. They both inch their way up the rope this week, ever closer to freedom. Appearing directly on the rope itself is newcomer <font color=yellow>#112 Nicholas Telford</font> whose portal is clearly messing with him. Everyone not on the rope is wandering mindlessly forward, a bit like lemmings (the pic really looks like lemmings now that I look at it). <font color=yellow>#124 Tyler Layton</font> is currently searching his lemming backpack for materials to build a bridge straight to the rope, whilst <font color=yellow>#134 Pierre Ruffin</font> hopes Tyler finishes it before he gets there. <font color=yellow>#157 Dexter Howe</font> does just enough to keep the rope in sight at the end of the long tunnel, and finally <font color=yellow>#157 Manuela Perez</font> is another new joiner this week and starts her long journey. <br><br>Honourable mentions this week to <font color=yellow>#208 Michael Rosnitschek</font> and <font color=yellow>#272 Daniel Sampson</font>, who both improved over half their times. As for everyone else....<br><br><img src=\"http://www.mariokart64.com/mkw/images/mkw7.jpg\"></p>",

Nick became the first person in 287 days to beat David and take the #1 crown. The lead was brief as David sent in a few times of his own, and now they are practically even on AF, only separated by 7 positions overall out of all 64 charts. Other people playing could swing this in either person's favour. A butterfly flapping its wings in Australia could...well..it's not going to do much to alter anything, but someone might think it looked pretty, and then what would we do?!? Beware the butterfly apocolypse people!!<br><br>Uhh..so that's that. Nick and David weren't the only people sending in times this update. There were 88 other people making promising moves, or promising to make moves, or you know. One of those \"you know\" people was <font color=yellow>#10 Tyler McNell</font>. Tyler was on his way to Oz to find a heart as he'd been coldly casting aside so many people on his journey up the chart that people had begun to talk. He saw Ben Hart up ahead, so passed 6 people in one dizzying move to smash into the top 10 and finish right behind him.<br><br>Someone in even a bigger hurry than Tyler, is <font color=yellow>#14 Jimmy Benson</font>. Jimmy PR'd 35 times, and cut 21% of his AF. Having only reached the top 20 in the last update, he's keen to be rid of the teen ranks as quickly as possible. Knocking on the door of the top 20 with his sword is <font color=yellow>#21 Jason Smith</font>. Gary Marcoz is standing on the other side of the door, so I wouldn't want to be him right about now. <font color=yellow>#24 Robert van Zanten</font> continues to make steady progress week in and week out. Not stopping for a rest this update, he's up 3 places.<br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Eric Hacksell</font> has said goodbye to his partner in crime Enders, and gone his own way past 5 players, although perhaps Pierrepont won't mind dropping a spot having reclaimed his LC WR.<font color=yellow>#28 Tony Ruiz</font> flexes his muscles as he makes light work of 11 players who may or may not be overweight. Spinach is good. At least this is what I learned from popeye. The 20-30 activity this week was intense to say the least, and breaking into the top 30 is <font color=yellow>#30 Brandon Sansui</font> whose last name I can't pronounce. It's probably a good thing these news updates are written and not spoken. <br><br>Simultaneously breaking into the top 60, top 50 and top 40 this week is <font color=yellow>#35 Rachel Emerson</font>, who was #107 a very short time ago. This is the biggest single AF cut of the update. I've taken a long time to get to the end of the top 50 writeup, and just by coincidence, the last person I'm going to mention is <font color=yellow>#46 David Long</font>, who has finished breaking things, and is now on his journey up the chart.<br><br><font color=cyan>50 to infinity, and beyond</font><br><font color=yellow>#53 Daniel Pascua</font> didn't much like being pointed out to the vultures last time out, and promptly picked up his pace, passing an even 10 players, and getting quite close to the top 50. <br>The winner of the <font color=orange>\"Minimum Effort, Maximum Gain\"</font> game this week is <font color=yellow>#55 Ashley O'Hara</font>, who passed 5 players with just 6 PRs total.  The winner of the <font color=orange>\"I can pass exactly 17 players\"</font> game is <font color=yellow>#56 Ricardo Costa</font>, who finished just 1 spot behind the efficient O'Hara. <font color=yellow>#60 Henrik Distel</font> is continuing to make great progress having only joined the site a few weeks ago. He breaks the top 60 with a 12 place gain. <br><br><font color=yellow>#69 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who has a name like he should be in movies, improved over half his times and is up 7 places. <font color=yellow>#74 Oliver Martin</font> is the highest new entry to the AF chart this week, so I'm going to go away and try to think of how to make fun of your name in a future update. These are the things we live for!  <font color=yellow>#77 Agustin Berrios</font> is another player who only recently broke into the top 100. He's making sure he stays here for quite some time, by making a nice 15 place move. <font color=yellow>#85 Joseph Knighton</font> has succeeded in his quest and is now valiantly guarding the king's daughter Sophie in 86th place. You can always rely on a knight!(on). <font color=yellow>#95 Alex Vandegrift</font> is fighting not to fall out of the top 100 with the fierce competition around. He moves up slightly this week and finds his feet. Finally, two players who broke into the top 100 this update. Congrats go to <font color=yellow>#97 Max Anossow</font> and <font color=yellow>#99 Nicholas Telford</font>, who passed 11 and 13 players respectively to get here.<br><br>Just cruelly missing out on the top 100 this update is <font color=yellow>#101 Kjeld van Keulen</font>. It's the single worst position to be in on the chart. Well, it's joint worst with..every position that isn't 1st. Kjeld moves up 9 spots. Moving closer to the top 100 also is <font color=yellow>#107 Thibaud Bourdeau</font>, who PR'd 18 times and moved up a few spots. Moving up a few spots too is <font color=yellow>#126 Zack Weber</font>, who is our newest times updater and doesn't afraid of anything.<br><br>Relatively new to the chart is <font color=yellow>#134 Dexter Howe</font>, who makes a great cut of 19 places to keep his momentum going. Another whose momentum is gaining them places is <font color=yellow>#154 Manuela Perez</font> improving 23 times and passing me. I should probably play again soon. <font color=yellow>#199 Adam Gilbert Pelling</font> not only has 3 names, but also broke into the top 200 this update. Good luck Adam. It's a hard climb from here to 100! Finally, our last mover is <font color=yellow>260 Daniel Sampson</font>, who once again improved exactly half his times to pass 12 players. <br><br>Good Karting everyone. I'm going to get some KFC.<br></p>",

I did see something move at the bottom of my garden earlier, but it was probably just the neighbours cat though and not elves. It's a nice cat, if a little tame. I once saw a bird taunt it by landing a few feet away and then flying back and forth to either side of it. I think the bird was trying to protect something as it was quite aggitated, and the cat eventually got bored and left. Awesome. Anyway, you don't need me rambling on about nothing. What you need are cool stats.<br><br>First cool stat of the week is that both <font color=yellow>#1 David</font> and <font color=yellow>#2 Nick</font> would have been champ this update, if the other one hadn't also played. But of course, they both did, so David maintains his slim lead from the previous update. It's still all to play for and I don't think we've seen the end of the battle here. Think world war 2 people. Chamberlain was all \"peace in our time\", and then one day Poland woke up and Germany was all like \"sup\", and Poland was all like \"uhh\". True story. This is what I have read in history books. Anyway, the moral of the story is not to take on Russia, cos it's stupidly cold there and they have a billion million people there.<br><br>Um. Everyone in the top 9 stayed exactly where they were last time around, with <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> the only one improving his AF with 10 PRs. Breaking into the top 10 this week is <font color=yellow>#10 Daniel Anderson</font>, who chose the red pill like his brother. Neo never mentioned having a brother of course, cos he wanted Trinity for himself and Daniel was always stealing his wimminz.<br><br><font color=cyan>The other people</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Jimmy Benson</font> improved yet again and is knocking on the door of the top 10 this update. There isn't actually a door though, and he'll need to get past Neo's brother before he can get there. Sounds like a good movie. Apart from Jimmy, nobody in the 11 to 20 zone passed anyone else, but there were some signs of life with a few PRs thrown in from people.<br>In the 20s there's a group of players who have all been PRing well. <font color=yellow>#24 Eric Hacksell</font> had another good week and finishing just a head of <font color=yellow>#25 Robert van Zanten</font>. Robert, despite being passed, passed Lewis Benny. <font color=yellow>#26 Tony Ruiz</font> also passed Lewis this week, which makes it a bad week for the former champion. In fact the only person *not* to pass Lewis this week was everyone else, so...yeah..that stat isn't really interesting, so we'll forget I mentioned it. <font color=orange>*takes out amnesia revolver*</font> One stat that is interesting though, and which defies the laws of nature themselves, is that even though Lewis didn't play at all..he didn't even look at his Wii, or even think about mariokart, he probably won't even read this update, and he was passed by 3 people. Even though all that happened, he somehow, managed to pass James Pierrepont. Such are the mysteries of the AF chart. Someone else who wants to pass Lewis soon is <font color=yellow>#29 Fabien Jacques</font>. He moves a place closer, with 14 PRs. I'm getting sleepy so I'm going to write the rest tomorrow. It'll be Groundhog Day then, so I'll have plenty of time to write it. :D<br><br>I'm going to assume that nothing changed overnight and that things don't get too confusing as a result. So after 29th, it stays a bit quiet. An eerie quiet, like people are planning something and you're not invited. The first person to break the silence is <font color=yellow>#48 Daniel Both</font>. He passes both Daniel Boettcher and Pierre Doffine. <font color=yellow>#50 Ricardo Costa</font> breaks into the top half of the top 100, with a nice move from #56. 17 PRs for him. <font color=yellow>#51 Henrik Distel</font> impresses even more with a 10 place move from #61, and netting 24 PRs and 2 butterflies. <font color=yellow>#58 Tim van Ham</font> makes me hungry, and moves a spot in the right direction. The right direction is upwards. Don't look down. <font color=yellow>#67 Salvatore Bellusci</font> continues on his way, with a nice 2 spot move, and luckily misses out being flattened by the epic move of the person behind him. That person is <font color=yellow>#68 Yorick Meeker</font>. Yorick PR'd so much that he probably had to buy a replacement wii. With 57 PRs, Yorick passed a grand total of 98 players. Yeouch. Way to break into the top 100 from nowhere!<br>Next up is <font color=yellow>#71 Oliver <font color=orange>\"Please sir, I want some more\"</font> Martin</font>. Oliver twisted past 3 players this update, already making decent progress since his appearance in the last update. Lurking menacingly behind him is <font color=yellow>#72 Biagio Macula</font>, who stormed past 21 players and kicked them while they were down. That's what people get for standing in his way. <font color=yellow>#74 Bastian Brinkmann</font> is our highest new entry to the AF chart. It's always impressive when anyone joins in the top 100.<br><br><font color=yellow>#83 Joseph Knighton</font> decided that he had a greater mission still, and after spending some time with the princess, continued his journey, leaving 2 players in his stead. Someone galloping at a much quicker pace behind him is <font color=yellow>#84 Max Anossow</font> who somehow managed to get a hold of a horse. He's up all the way from 97th. <font color=yellow>#93 Alex Vandegrift</font> is further solidifying his footing in the top 100, moving up 2 spots to guarantee his place for at least a few more weeks. Finally, <font color=yellow>#94 Du Bois</font> once again breaks into the top 100, having slipped out of it a few weeks ago. With a 10 point AF gap to #100, he'll be safe for a while yet too.<br><br>When we get to the players outside the top 100, it becomes a little more difficult to maintain your position. New people arriving always tends to obscure upward momentum. <font color=yellow>#116 Andrew Manning</font> pushed on despite this disadvantage and moved up 4 spots to finish just behind Nicholas Harvey who improved his AF, but dropped a couple of spots. <font color=yellow>#117 Simon Uldry</font> and <font color=yellow>#120 Luke Berrill</font> are both new entrants to the AF chart this week, completing their timeset with a full 64 submissions. The more people who do this, the better for the site as a whole. <font color=yellow>#123 Dexter Howe</font> made great gains on those around him, dispatching 11 players without mercy. Only 1 person from #127 to #187 actually submitted anything this update, making it one of the least active places, and easiest to move up for anyone playing. <font color=yellow>#188 Adam Gilbert Pelling</font> will hope it stays that way for the next while, as he rises another 11 places, after breaking into the top 200 last update.  <font color=yellow>#201 Michael Rosnitschek</font> finishes tantalizingly close to the top 200, with 34 PRs, and will be hoping to break into it by the next update. The only other 2 players to pass anyone this time out were, <font color=yellow>#257 Daniel Sampson</font> and <font color=yellow>#266 David Castaneda</font>. 17 PRs from both of them this time out. <br><br>Until next time...!</p>",

Only a single position separates them. 1/64th of an AF point. Anyone beating any of Nick's times will cause a tie for #1 spot and will cause the site to explode in a mushroom cloud of numbers and text. The rest of the top 10 made 10 PRs between them, but it wasn't enough for anyone to move up a spot. The first person to make up some solid ground this week is <font color=yellow>#13 Mark Schmidt</font>, who passed Brendan and Alvin Le. <font color=yellow>#17 Mickael Smolen</font> didn't climb this week, but did improve his AF, as he attacked Sherbet Land and made significant gains. He also scared away one of the penguins. <font color=yellow>#18 Jason Smith</font> is back this week, as he smashes through the door to the top 20, and knocks a couple of people over who were standing near it. It's Mickael vs Jason next week, as the Penguin intimidator meets the sword.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Tony Ruiz</font> moves a spot closer to <font color=yellow>#24 Eric Hacksell</font> this update, who also played a little. Both may decide to team up to take out Moseley this week, or turn on each other. <font color=yellow>#27 Fabien Jacques</font> is creeping up behind both of them, stealthily hiding behind a bush each time they look around. With RVZ in the middle of this encounter, anything could happen. <font color=yellow>#30 Dustin Enders</font> breaks into the top 30 with healthy dose of 16 PRs.<br><br><font color=yellow>#39 Sam Hoar</font> plays for the first time in 2010, and passes Bob who was Holden him back. <font color=yellow>#43 Franco Gubser</font> does 1 better than Sam and passes 2, whilst <font color=yellow>#49 Henrik Distel</font> breaks into the top 50 and says so Long to David. The last mover in the top 50 is <font color=yellow>#49 Ricardo Costa</font>. He passed both Both and Doffine. Welcome to our 2 highest new entries to the AF chart this week, <font color=yellow>#53 Gavin Price</font> and <font color=yellow>#54 Ross Coleman</font>. They both sent in a full set of times and impress by starting in the top 100. They are now pitted against each other in a lifelong rivalry against each other, because I said so.<br><br><font color=yellow>#55 Ashley O'Hara</font> played for the first time in a month and got some decent Legend times to add to his collection. Another player back from inactivity is <font color=yellow>#59 Andrew Tran</font>. Andrew hadn't played since July, but whistled passed Dixie, ate some Ham, and finally beat the Boss. Elsewhere, <font color=yellow>#67 Salvatore Bellusci</font> improved almost 4 AF points, but gained no positions. Luckily he only needs to gain 1 more to pass a clump of 3 players. Also hoping to pass that clump is <font color=yellow>#68 Oliver Martin</font>, who had the Will to pass Kristopher and got the Best of Justin. <font color=yellow>#70 Max Anossow</font> has a great week with a 14 place move. He's definitely living up to his name. Another one on the brink of success is <font color=yellow>#75 Bastian Brinkmann</font>. His 20 PRs nets him 4 places. <font color=yellow>#86 Sophie Steiner</font> makes up some lost ground from the few weeks she was inactive, making sure to stay clear of the #100 dropzone for another while. Finally, congratulations to <font color=yellow>#91 Michael Schnieder</font> who breaks into the top 100 this week with an impressive 41 place move, which is the best move of the update.<br><br>Closing in on the top 100 is <font color=yellow>#104 Michael van der Willick</font> who cuts 2.5 AF points but is still 6 away from his goal. Making a very impressive effort to reach the top 100 is <font color=yellow>#106 Nicholas Harvey</font>. With 24 PRs, he passed 9 players. Just 6 more to go! Those final 6 are always the most difficult of course. Especially when new people suddenly appear on the AF chart. <font color=yellow>#116 Fintan Kelly</font> is up 3 spots and is about to take the #1 Irish spot away from Robert Lee who is just 1 ahead of him. Finally, honourable mentions this week to <font color=yellow>Luke Berrill, Dexter Howe</font> and <font color=yellow>Adam Gilbert Pelling</font><br><br>See you next time.</p>",

The gap is out to 1.3 now. <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font> is up to an all time high position this week, and has closed the gap to 2nd from 5.4 to 4.7. Every point at this level though is sheer hell. (as opposed to normal fluffy hell). Closing like a freight train on everyone is <font color=yellow>#5 Jimmy Benson</font>. I'm not sure if freight trains are supposed to be fast, but I wouldn't want to be standing in the way of one. 20 PRs from Jimmy brings him up 4 places, to lead the chasing pack. The gap between #5 and #4 is the same as #12 and #5, so it's a long way to climb to gain anything now. Not quite in train terrority, but moving steadily, perhaps on a bike of some sort is <font color=yellow>#10 Daniel Anderson</font>. Mr Anderson broke back into the top 10, having been shunted out by Jimmy's previous move. <font color=yellow>#11 Tyler McNell</font> is also making a play for the top 10, and I can see long-time champion Alvin falling victim to a number of players over the next month or so. Ben lost out this week, having been passed by Tyler and Daniel.<br><br>There were some small moves in the teens (that sounds weird), with <font color=yellow>#16 Mickael Smolen</font> leaping over Leif and <font color=yellow>#18 Joe Sebeny</font>, who sobered up and repassed Smith. It's not fair for me to imply that Joe has a drinking problem, so I apologise for that. He can quit any time he wants. Last of the teens...at..ehh..twenteen...<font color=yellow>#20 Tony Ruiz</font> breaks the top 20 with a nice 5 place move.<br><br>Further down and <font color=yellow>#28 Dustin Enders</font> is making moves again. With 20 PRs he passes Lewis and Andy, and is closing in on RVZ. Following in his wake is <font color=yellow>#29 Brandon Sansui</font>, who makes a nice 3 place move to make it a very bad week for Lewis Benny who drops 4 places. <font color=yellow>#33 Rachel Emerson</font> busts <font color=yellow>#34 Anis Taktak</font> out of jail for some reason and they both pass Markus in a shocking twist. <font color=yellow>#38 Henrik Distel</font> completes the movement in the top 40 with 23 PRs and a 4 place move.<br><br>It's mostly quiet from 40 to 50, but there's a flurry of activity right in the middle where 3 players have clustered together, all having made decent moves. <font color=yellow>#44 Ricardo Costa</font> leads the way, knocking a few players over and making it easier for the other 2 to pass them. He's up from 47. <font color=yellow>#45 Ross Coleman</font> is up from 55th, which is a hell of a move (the fluffy kind), and <font color=yellow>#46 Oliver Martin</font> breaks into the top 50 too from #53. Who will end up ahead out of these three next update?<br><br>Then we have a small gap to our next major mover, who karted to the max. <font color=yellow>#55 Max Anossow</font> made a 17 place move, which is hugely impressive. He has to kart that way though, cos of his name. <font color=yellow>#61 Salvatore Bellusci</font> is making some nice headway and should break into the top 60 by the next update. <font color=yellow>#64 Scotty van den Berg</font> beamed in as our highest new entry to the AF chart this week. We like getting those 64 times. Too few people send them all in to us. <font color=yellow>#73 David Lee</font> makes the move of the update, having started from #99. There's no chance of him falling out of the top 100 for a few months now. <font color=yellow>#74 Bastian Brinkmann</font> was passed by David and the magically appearing Scotty, but still managed to move up a place. <font color=yellow>#81 Michael Schneider</font> submitted 33 new PRs and got his reward with a 10 place move up the chart. <font color=yellow>#89 Nate Paternost</font> joins this week in the top 100, which is always a great achievement, as the competition gets tougher. Lastly, <font color=yellow>#98 Luke Glendinning</font> breaks into the top 100, with an 11 place move. It's always a nice feeling to make it in. Staying here is tougher though.<br><br>Outside the top 100, <font color=yellow>#111 Dexter Howe</font> was making short work of 11 players. (Yes, I mean he killed them) <font color=yellow>#119 Luke Berrill</font> moved up a couple of places with 12 PRs and <font color=yellow>#134 Pierre Ruffin</font> passed 8 with his 12 PRs. Down in the mid 200s, <font color=yellow>#256 Alvaro Fababu</font> sends in 61 PRs, to start his long climb up the ladder. Finally, an honourable mention to <font color=yellow>#140 Noah Gordon</font>, who moved up 5 places even though nobody seems to be updating his times.<br><br>That's it. I'll update sooner next time. ;)</p>",

Lastly, congrats to <font color=yellow>#98 Thibaud Bourdeau</font>, who breaks into the top 100 with a nice 10 place move.<br><br>Honourable mentions to some people outside the top 100 who also made up some places this update:<br><font color=yellow>#116 Luke Berrill, #127 Zack Weber, #136 Noah Gordon, #149 Tom Norton, #166 Sam Smith, #189 Adam Proulx, #211 Alex Hantson</font> and <font color=yellow>#250 Alexander Walz</font><br><br>I'll be back when I'm feeling better. :) </b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b><br>Before I start rabbling on about the usual, let me rabble on about something else. I think karters in general can get a lot of crap about what we do here, and people can say we're basically wasting our time driving around in circles for hours on end, but I disagree. Whilst a lot of other repetitive activities, be it with something like professional sports, or even day to day jobs can net more reward in terms of financial gain, time trialers strive to improve for no obvious reward; a small mention in a news update every now and then, but nothing amazing. So I think a lot of positives can be taken from the fact that we strive to improve ourselves in something relatively meaningless. We do it for the inner sense of achievement, and that will stand us well in other areas of life.<br><br><br>Or something...<br><br><br><br>Anyway...we had some new people join recently.

Most of the time though, it leads to rising places on the AF chart, which I guess is pretty exciting. Up out ahead, looking for people to pass but then remembering that he's passed everyone already is  <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade</font>. He'd be rising places on the AF chart if there were any more to rise. At it is, he just pulled further ahead, with his lead up to 2 AF points. 11 PRs is an impressive total from him. Nobody else in the top 10 decided to do much, so #11 Tyler McNell decided to become <font color=yellow>#8 Tyler McNell</font>. A top 5 place is within shooting distance now, although karting would probably help better. <font color=yellow>#15 Mickael Smolen</font> and <font color=yellow>#16 Alvin Le</font> decided to swap places, but practically have the same AF. <font color=yellow>#19 Eric Hacksell</font> and <font color=yellow>#20 Robert van Zanten</font> pushed aside Jason Smith and round out the top 20 nicely.<br><br>The 20 to 30 range was a bit quiet apart from two people. One was <font color=yellow>#25 Brandon Sansui</font>, who climbed a nice 4 places with 22 strong PRs. The other was our highest new entry, and newcomer <font color=yellow>#29 Werth Rath</font>. To join the site so highly ranked is quite an achievement, and the best we've seen in a long while.<br><br>We don't see another rise in rank til we get to <font color=yellow>#43 Oliver Martin</font>. Oliver passed 3 players and is close to the top 40 now. Right on his heels, even though Oliver doesn't wear heels, but if he did, there's be someone right on them. Anyway, that person is <font color=yellow>#44 Max Anossow</font>, who PR'd 23 times and passed 7 players. Good work to everyone in the top 50 who PR'd. We need your efforts to keep our site competitive on a worldwide scale. <br><br>Outside the top 50 we have <font color=yellow>#52 Gavin Price</font>, who got bumped down by the magically appearing Werth, lost 1.3 AF to natural drift, and ended up 2 spots higher than he was in the last update. Whatever you're doing, keep that up! <font color=yellow>#56 Nate Paternost</font> was more of a traditionalist though and cut 10 AF to finish 8 places higher. Another person on the up is <font color=yellow>#58 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, into the top 60 with a 3 place move.<br><br>A little bit further down, but still going strong is <font color=yellow>#75 Sebastian Wimmer</font>. He's up 5 spots overall. <font color=yellow>#86 Yannick Wiesner</font> is up more places than you can shake a fist at (what?), with a 32 place move which catapults him straight into the top 100 and then some. This is what happens when you improve nearly all your times. A thought for <font color=yellow>#92 Alex Vandegrift</font> this time out, who PR'd 17 times, made a nice 7 point AF cut, and rose 0 places. The good news though is that if he does that again, he'll pass the 7 people straight ahead of him. <font color=yellow>#94 Blake Germany</font> appears very respectably on the AF chart in the top 100, and <font color=yellow>#96 Thibaud Bourdeau</font> rounds out our top 100 action with 19 PRs and a 2 place move up the ladder.<br><br>Just on the brink of the top 100 is a new entry to the chart of <font color=yellow>#102 Martin Prigent</font>. He'll be looking to rectify that next time out. <font color=yellow>#114 Fintan Kelly</font>, makes a nice 7 place move on his journey to the promised land. Someone who wasn't promised any land, but it still making good progress is <font color=yellow>#130 Noah Gordon</font>. He cut 6 places, to finish just behind Zack, who PR'd enough to stay ahead. A little further down, <font color=yellow>#158 Sam Smith</font> makes light work of 8 inactive players, including me. I'm not really inactive. I'm just playing in my mind. I keep missing my PRs though. <font color=yellow>#202 Alex Hantson</font> rises 9 places and is just on the cusp of the top 200. It's not as nice as the top 100, but at least you don't need to wear a tie to be let in. <font color=yellow>#264 Daniel Sampson</font> has a nice week, rising a few places with 27 PRs. Lastly, an honourable mention to <font color=yellow>#275 Christophe Charignon</font> who improved 30 times and rose 13 places. It's a long road ahead, and you may have to buy a tie at some point, but the journey is worth it!<br><br>Keep karting!</p>",

Of course, it would probably be better to post on the message board rather than trying to cut your AF, but hey, it worked for Fried, and it can work for you. (Note: it can't work for you..and Fried had some cool MB campaigns to help him). Think of a campaign, several campaigns, seven campaigns. That word is suddenly meaningless to me. Anyway, in mkwii-specific news, Rosalina was caught talking to Luigi in the locker-room of the gym. Word quickly spread back to Mario who is a bit peeved. You see, Luigi isn't allowed to get the girl, any girl, even if Mario already has Peach, because Mario is a bit of an ass. Later in life, Luigi gets so annoyed at his older, cooler brother that he transforms into a grotesque monster, and travels back in time to become Mario's nemesis, but I guess that's not really mkwii-specific news at all.<br><br>Uhhh...so let me first mention 2 guys that have been helping out here over the last while that haven't really gotten a proper mention. That's Zack Weber and Andy Lundeen. When everyone else disappears off, or forgets the updating password, these guys have been putting in a lot of work. Without them, I'd have to update the times, and I just don't want to ever have to do that, because it's painful. :) They also help out with other things, like proof issues, and Zack will be helping out with news updates soon too.<br><br>Now I'll get to the nitty gritty bits and bobs of the mystical AF table. <br><br>In another, different, parallel universe where we decided to abandon lap times as something people want to get, and where people like wearing funny hats, I'd be talking about Andrew Grieve, Lee Duggan, Aziz Abdullah, Yu Nakano and Jazz Ahmed, who are all in the top 10 of the 3lap AF chart, but none of whom appear on the main AF chart. There's also a guy called Edvard Tsymbala, who has a cool name I could have made fun of, but unfortunately this isn't a parallel universe. It's not even a perpendicular one.... (I'm not on drugs..really) This is just the regular universe where 3laps and 1laps are given equal weighting, and not having a full set of times costs you being mentioned in my rambles. 322 out of 725 registered players have a full set, and this makes me a very sad panda.<br><br>Anyway, right at the top of these 322 people, and also the 3-lap chart sits <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade</font>. Nick and David are both in matchups today and with any sense of justice will sail through the round. Nick pulled slightly away from David this update with 3 PRs. <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font> made a slight move towards Nick, but Marc was more focussed on getting some Site Records than moving up the AF chart. There's a sizable gap to be traversed, and he has to do what he has to do. Eating/breathing..that sort of thing. <font color=yellow>#5 Jimmy Benson</font> played, with 6 PRs and cut a full AF point. He's in a bit of a void, not too close to 4th, and not too close to 6th. However we have a new 6th this week, one <font color=yellow>Tyler McNell</font>. There were 2 Tyler McNells, one of them from a perpendicular universe, but our Tyler killed him off because he was evil and had a goatee. And shifty eyes. And a gun. Tyler moves up from 8th, passing Alex and James. Everyone else in the top 10 shrugged like they didn't care.<br><br>Outside, the top 10 where Luigi-level resentment is bound to manifest itself in strange ways, <font color=yellow>#12 Mark Schmidt</font> makes a move. He passes Ben Hart, and isn't too far away from that top 10, and an almost guaranteed mention in a news update if you PR. I generally only mention people outside the top 10 if they've made a cut or moved up some places, or they bribe me with ice cream. Mmmm, tasty. <font color=yellow>#15 Alvin Le</font> didn't get me any ice cream, but he did move up from 16th,  pushing Mickael Smolen down a spot, but in a polite way. Just at the brink of the top 20, both <font color=yellow>#19 Robert van Zanten</font> and <font color=yellow>#20 Eric Hacksell</font> played, with Robert keeping Eric at bay, whilst reeling in Joe. A similar improvement from both next time out, will see them pass him easily.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Fabien Jacques</font> PR'd 8 times, and moved past Brandon and Tim, with typical French style. Do French people have typical style? Well, they do now. <font color=yellow>#27 Werth Rath</font>, who I feel like shortening to W.Rath, passed Tim and Kieron this time out. Tim had a bad week, and may fall out of the top 30 soon. Making a shock move, and breaking into the top 30 is <font color=yellow>#29 Andy Lundeen</font>. In between slaving away behind the scenes, he managed to PR 13 times. Unlucky for some, those being Kieron, Dustin and James.<br><br>Down the street and to the left, and then to the left again, and keep going til you reach a church, then go into the church and stop and pray for a bit, then leave the church by the door you came in, and go left again, then keep going and take the 3rd right. Anyway, if you do all that eventually you'll come to <font color=yellow>#38 Oliver Martin</font>. Oliver is being chased by <font color=yellow>#39 Max Anossow</font>. Max passed 5 players, and so did Oliver. They both crack the top 40, the vandals!<br><br>Nobody cracked the top 50, because we put extra strong titanium at the wall surrounding the top 50, and also because nobody really PR'd enough. Someone who PR'd quite significantly though was <font color=yellow>#54 Tim van Ham</font>. Tim's PR's gave him a 5 place gain, and a sense of a job well done. The top 60 was breached by one time site champion <font color=yellow>#59 Kevin Borne</font>. Kevin is back this update with 15 PRs. If he makes the same AF cut next time as this time, he could be close to breaking that top 50 too. Hello to <font color=yellow>#62 Zane Royal</font>, who appears on the proper AF chart for the first time in the top 100, which is always a great achievement. I'll see if I can think of a Zany role for him to play in my next anagrammatical update. (Note, I will not be anagramming an update. This is a lie. Give me ice cream.)<br><br>The top 80 was broken once upon a time, by an angry ogre. We put it back together again, but then along came <font color=yellow>#76 Agustin Berrios</font>. Smashed it he did. 10 PRs and a smashing 5 place gain for him. <font color=yellow>#87 Blake Germany</font> posts the most number of PRs so far, with 17. He rose 8 places to break out of the precarious 90s. Nobody likes being in the 90s for too long, because the only place to fall is down. Unless you're australian. I think they fall up. <font color=yellow>#97 Martin Prigent</font> isn't Australian, but he has made it into the top 100. Well done Martin. The hard part is staying here!<br>:)<br><br>Outside the top 100, where it's a little creepy..like you're about to be pounced on by hungry wolves, is <font color=yellow>#113 Luke Berrill</font>. Luke is up 3 spots this week, and is now right behind Leslie Wolf. It seems the chasers have become the chasees. Or something.. <font color=yellow>#130 Noah Gordon</font> played a little, and passed <font color=yellow>#131 Zack Weber</font>, who also found time to play when he wasn't being slave driven by me to do more work. After this, a stupid number of inactive players go by. So much so that I'm going to mention <font color=yellow>#193 John Koh</font>. He PR'd twice, and maintained his spot, whilst everyone else was inactive..almost 100 players in a row! <font color=yellow>#264 Daniel Sampson</font> rounds out the movement, with 8 PRs this time round!<br><br>That's all folks!</p>",

Not at the bottom, but the only one in the lower ranks doing some damage is <font color=yellow>#269 Murray Wright</font>. He sends in 34 PRs to cut 13 points off his AF to start his climb. The next mover is <font color=yellow>#206 Andrew <font color=orange>\"15\"</font> Jones</font>. Andrew PR'd 15 times, took 15 points off his AF and rose 15 places. Then he went out at ate 15 donuts, just because he could. So, after that, a whole load of people did nothing at all. They're probably off doing other summery things, or playing Super Mario Galaxy 2. I hear it's a good game, but needs more TTing. <br>;)<br><br><font color=yellow>#148 Tom Norton</font> breaks the silence in the mid 100s, by breaking into the top 150. I say \"breaking into\", but it's more like \"non-falling-out-of\", even though he did fall out of it..so basically he rebroke into the top 150. It doesn't matter. Tom got his CM site record back and tied the MC world record. This is all that matters. Some things are more important than AF. Like world peace, and pieces of chocolate cake. <font color=yellow>#132 Zack Weber</font> and <font color=yellow>#131 Noah Gordon</font> PR'd a bit but made no significant cutz. <font color=yellow>#113 Dexter Howe</font> shows them Howe it's done (sorry), and moves up a spot with his 9 PRs. Lastly, <font color=yellow>#106 Luke Berrill</font> makes a very decent run to the top 100, with 21 PRs and a 7 place jump. He's only 5 AF from a top 100 spot now.<br><br>Breaking into the top 100 this week is Ireland's #1 <font color=yellow>#98 Fintan Kelly</font>. He gains 18 spots and is amongst the elite now. His actual rank is Hero D, but \"amongst the heroes\" sounds kinda stupid, like he should have a superpower. <font color=yellow>#97 Martin Prigent's</font> superpower is \"staying where he is\". He maintains his top 100 spot with some strong PRs. <font color=yellow>#94 Alex Vandegrift</font> and <font color=yellow>#93 Marcus Wood</font> improve a little, but have started drifting backwards. They need to find some powers of their own like <font color=yellow>#92 Thibaud Bourdeau</font>. He flies over both of them, and 4 other people too. It's possible he had a bike though, and there was a ramp. Flying would be cool.<br><br>A little further up, and <font color=yellow>#77 Sebastian Wimmer</font> stays 77th despite the appearance of a new player to the AF chart pushing everyone down at least 1 spot. <font color=yellow>#75 Yanick Wiesner</font> goes 1 better, and then goes 12 more better. He's up 13 places. Unlucky for them! <font color=yellow>#73 Sophie Steiner</font> passes 4 people, then gets passed by 3 people, so gains a place! <font color=yellow>#68 Jon Coppernoll</font> has a great week, with 37 unique PRs. He's up from the brink of the top 100 this update, a 22 place gain. That would have been a 23 place gain had <font color=yellow>#64 Agustin Berrios</font> not made a decent move of his own. Up 12, and heading for greater things. Congratulations to our highest new entry this week: <font color=yellow>#63 Simone Bertini</font>. Joining with such highly ranked times, including a sub 1'10 on LC is very impressive.<br><br><font color=yellow>#61 Zane Royal</font> moves up slightly this week with a batch of 10 PRs. <font color=yellow>#55 Gavin Price</font> sends in 5 of his own, but loses out to 4 players in a very active mid-section. The first is <font color=yellow>#54 Salvatore Bellusci</font>. He's up 4 places, and only a PR or two away from another few places. <font color=yellow>#51 Daniel Boettcher</font> is up 10 full spots with only 15 PRs. He's on the brink of the top 50, and would have had it if not for <font color=yellow>#50 Kevin Borne</font>. The ex-champ of mkwii climbs 9 places to get himself back into the top 50 this week. Lastly, <font color=yellow>#48 Tim van Ham</font> also breaks into the top 50 with a nice 6 place move. Without that move he would have found himself behind most of the guys in this paragraph!<br><br>40-50 sees <font color=yellow>#43 Franco Gubser</font> passing Sam and Bob, and now he sits just behind long time champ Michael Fried. <font color=yellow>37th/38th/39th, Henrik/Oliver/Max </font> all make some good progress, but all stay where they are, like jogging on a treadmill. Into the top 25, and <font color=yellow>#24 Fabien Jacques</font> is up a spot past Gary. <font color=yellow>#18 Eric Hacksell</font> makes a decisive move, taking him up 2 spots. After that, 3 players try to move up a single spot with minimal effort. <font color=yellow>#15 Mickael Smolen</font> is up a spot with 2 PRs. <font color=yellow>#14 Alvin Le</font> is up a spot with 4, and <font color=yellow>#12 Ben Hart</font> is up one with 8 PRs. Mickael wins the competition with the fewest PRs. Ben is really quite close to the top 10 now though.<br>:)<br><br>Into the top 10 now, and <font color=yellow>#6 Alex Shoal</font> does enough to get past Tyler this week. <font color=yellow>#5 Jimmy Benson</font> and <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font> both play, solidifying their positions. The outstanding move of the update however has to be right at the top. <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade</font>, already champion, and with a healthy lead, sends in 17 PRs to move from being 2 AF points ahead to being 4 AF points ahead. His dominance right now is really quite strong, and it will be a while before anyone challenges that.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><font color=yellow>Andrew Grieve </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows crs</font> time of 1'16\"529 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'16\"189</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>tied the old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'21\"889 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'21\"889</font>1'21\"889</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 1'57\"795 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'57\"480</font><br><font color=yellow>Marc Bas </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall lap</font> time of 0'37\"910 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'37\"846</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 0'36\"731 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'36\"711</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Both </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine lap</font> time of 0'09\"698 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"662</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 0'19\"845 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'19\"625</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano lap</font> time of 0'04\"526 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04\"525</font><br><font color=yellow>Jazz Ahmed </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moonview Highway crs</font> time of 1'44\"029 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'43\"842</font><br><font color=yellow>Andrew Grieve </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'12\"477 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'12\"039</font><br><font color=yellow>Zane Royal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway crs</font> time of 1'42\"672 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'42\"496</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Mario Circuit lap</font> time of 0'28\"863 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'28\"817</font><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Welcome to: <font color=lime>Simone Bertini and Tim Weaver</font><br><br>Tune in next time.</p>",

The gap opens up to 5.3 AF points which is the biggest gap between 1st and 2nd that we've seen in quite some time. <font color=yellow>#6 Tyler McNell</font> moves up a spot and leapfrogs Alex Shoal with 7 nice times, closing in on the top 5.

Jorge joined with the most impressive set of times we've seen so far, displacing Nick at the top of the chart, and pushing the entire field down a place. The only person in the top 10 not to lose a place was, <font color=yellow>#7 Tyler McNell</font> who stayed where he was due to passing Alex. The top 10 remained unchanged apart from that. Closing in on the top 10 this update is <font color=yellow>#11 Mickael Smolen</font>, who improved nearly a quarter of his times and moved up 4 spots.

The rest of the update will be written from universe 2. It's a nice universe. We have jello.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Some people don't like this universe very much. For starters, everyone gets bumped down one spot, and for seconders, there's a strange smell. One person who finds the universe a bit confusing is <font color=yellow>#15 Mark Schmidt</font>, who improved his AF in universe 1, but lost 2 places in universe 2. What a cruel place it can be. Quite a few people managed to maintain their places in the top 25 though, even with the automatic demotion. <font color=yellow>#18 Eric Hacksell, #22 Jamie Disley and #23 Tony Ruiz</font> were successful in their battle against the tide. They also brought their surfboards, to ride the cosmic waves.<br><br>In actual impressive news, regardless of jello or surfing, or other mad irrelevant ramblings, <font color=yellow>#35 Bob Holden</font> makes a fantastic move. He's up from 45th last time out, and a great 36 PR haul reaps him great rewards. He's just 1 spot behind ex-champ Lewis Benny now. After that, a trio of players make some great moves. <font color=yellow>#42 Daniel Boettcher</font> is up from 51st, breaking into the top 50 with 18 PRs. <font color=yellow>#43 Ricardo Costa</font> moves up nicely from 49th with 18 of his own, and <font color=yellow>#44 David Long</font>, improves over half his times, and makes a 12 place move this update. Very nicely done to all 3, and it will be interesting to see who pushes on into the top 40 now.<br><br>The next few players may be outside the top 50 for now, but they're looking like they won't stay there for too much longer. <font color=yellow>#51 Salvatore Bellusci</font> improves 24 of his times, and is now just a few AF away from a group of players in the late 40s. <font color=yellow>#53 Zane Royal's</font> 8 place move puts him just a couple of AF behind Salvatore. <font color=yellow>#56 Nate Paternost</font> posts a 21 PR haul, to move him up 4 spots, while <font color=yellow>#58 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> moves up a full 13 places from 71st. Those 4 players had 98 PRs between them.<br><br>Further down the list, <font color=yellow>#64 Yannick Wiesner</font> continues his good run of form. He was up 13 places last time out, and is up a further 11 places this time. <font color=yellow>#68 Emmanuel Amador</font> appears at a very respectable top 100 position on the AF chart after sending in his full set of times. <font color=yellow>#74 Sebastian Wimmer</font> shows Hendrik who's the boss, passing him and 2 other players. Irish champion <font color=yellow>#76 Fintan Kelly</font> destroys any hopes I might have had of ever getting back the #1 spot, by climbing 22 places with 25 strong PRs. <font color=yellow>#82 Thibaud Bourdeau</font> also put in a great performance, and is up from 92nd spot, solidifying his place in the top 100 for a long while to come. <font color=yellow>#95 Martin Prigent</font> battles to maintain his own place, up from 97th, despite the automatic demotions from players appearing ahead of him. Finally, the unluckiest person on the list has to be <font color=yellow>#101 Luke Berrill</font>.

        "content": "<p><b><center><br><img src=\"damned.jpg\"><br></center><br>As you stroll along a lonely road, you notice a castle in distance. A couple of confusing signs give you the impression that the castle is also home to a dam of some sort, and owned by a guy called Ned. On closer inspection, you feel you're about to stumble across a giant game of connect 4. You decide to check it out...<br><center><br><img src=\"damned2.jpg\"><br></center><br>The castle seems to have an enormous number of rooms. A passerby gives you some more information about them.<br>\"The castle always has the exact number of rooms needed for the number of guests staying in it. The rooms with green lights are there to welcome new guests. The rooms with bright yellow lights are for those people upgrading to better rooms. The dimmer lights indicate some activity in that particular room, and where it's black, the person in the room is asleep.\" <br>What an interesting castle....<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>I alluded to this in the half-update of tininess, but <font color=yellow>Nick Meade</font> has reclaimed the top spot, having lost it briefly to Jorge a few weeks ago. A solid 10 PRs took his AF down half a point. 4 other players played in the top 10. <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> lost a little ground, but took the top spot at Koopa Cape lap. <font color=yellow>#5 Shaun Tanney</font> went on a massive PR blitz, taking down 18 times and gaining an AF point, but the limbo ground between 4th and 6th is over 10 AF spots wide. <font color=yellow>#10 Mickael Smolen</font> only PR'd once, but did enough to leapfrog Alvin to break into the top 10, and knock Alvin out for the first time in 10 years.<br><br>Outside the top 10, <font color=yellow>#12 Ben Hart</font> took Mickael's advice and PR'd once, and passed Daniel Anderson. <font color=yellow>#8 Alex Shoal, #16 Alvin Le, #22 Jamie Disley and #25 Fabien Jacques</font> got 5 PRs between them, but didn't pass anyone. They'll be paying more attention to the Mickael guide for <font color=orange>\"minimal effort, maximum gain\"</font> next time out.<br><br>At #27 we have a new player, which is hugely impressive, as most people join further down the top 100, and most join outside it. Welcome to <font color=yellow>#27 Marvin Rekovsky</font>. Someone who has been here quite a lot longer, is LC specialist <font color=yellow>#29 James Pierrepont</font>. His 10 PRs bring him up 4 spots, and into the top 30. <font color=yellow>#36 Bob Holden</font> got a lot closer to Lewis Benny this time out. Next time out, he'll be hoping to be further away from him, and past him.  <font color=yellow>#40 Max Anossow</font> does enough to move into the top 40 with 14 PRs, and a nice AF cut. <br><br>Next we get to <font color=yellow>#46 Yannick Wenger</font>, who was confused with Yannick Wiesner for a while, and whose PRs got intermingled. I'm still not sure if everything is back to normal. So if you're both reading this, check your profiles to make sure you've got the right times, and submit the correct versions if not. Anyway, Yannick passed 24 players with his 42 PRs, including the other Yannick, and put his personal stamp on the top 50. Nice job! <font color=yellow>#48 Salvatore Bellusci</font> also put in a nice performance to break the top 50. He's up 3 spots this time out. Rounding out the top 50 is <font color=yellow>#50 Ross Coleman</font>, who exactly nails it by climbing up 2 spots from #52. The top 50 is now officially cool, as you're all better than one time mkwii legend Michael Fried.<br><br>As we fall into the latter section of the top 100, <font color=yellow>#70 Sebastian Wimmer</font> makes a nice move of 4 places, passing <font color=yellow>#71 Jon Coppernoll</font> who in turn moves up a place from last time out. <font color=yellow>#72 Emmanuel Amador</font> loses out this week, but is still in touching distance of both. Then we come to 3 players who have all made an appearance for the first time on the AF chart, and all break into the top 100 to do it. Congrats and welcome go to <font color=yellow>#81 Artur Bauer, #89 Stefan Nunner and #94 Lars Riecken</font>. A success story now, as <font color=yellow>#97 Luke Berrill</font> overcomes just barely missing out last time, and breaks into the top 100, even with 3 new players appearing just above him. Now begins the difficult job of staying here! <font color=yellow>#100 Martin Prigent</font> rounds out the top 100, doing enough to stay out of the clutches of the ravenous top 200 crowd. They need to learn how to order room service!<br><br>Outside the top 100, only a few people gained any places. <font color=yellow>#132 Noah Gordon</font> is up one spot. <font color=yellow>#142 Sam Smith</font> is up a very impressive 15 places, and <font color=yellow>197 Michael Timpe</font> breaks into the top 200, by passing 6 players.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Records</font><br>Just the 2 Site records this week:<br><font color=yellow>Marc Bas </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape lap</font> time of 0'44\"639 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'44\"404</font><br><font color=yellow>Aziz Abdullah </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach crs</font> time of 1'22\"608 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'22\"604</font><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Welcome to: <font color=lime>Artur Bauer, Marvin Rekovsky, Robin Cheah, Ruben Darío, Robert Bonomo, Stefan Nunner, Darius</font><br><br>I hope you like it in the castle, because once you check in, you can never leave...</p>",

It's me, Zack Weber a.k.a. thewebinator and Lacey agreed to let me help out with some of the updates since he's had the tough job of running them on his own for the last two or so years. So bear with me since it's my first time, and hopefully I won't ruin the fun of news updates for everyone.<br><br>Anyway, enough of talking about me and let's get to the actual news that's been happening for the past week.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Only two people joining this week, and neither joined the overall AF chart.<br><font color=lime>Clement Rouchon</font> joined with just the 32 course set of times, and slots in hypothetically somewhere in the 180s.<br><font color=lime>Andrea Gardina</font> submitted the same 32 records and at the same pace would land around 290th place.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Following <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade's</font> reclaiming of the site title from #2 Jorge Hernandez, he tried to push further ahead by submitting two PRs, however gained no ground. Moving down the charts to reach the next active player we hit <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font>, who is still trying to break into the elite group known as the top five. He knocked out five PRs and cut about one AF point, but he still needs to kart down 8 more AF points before he can reach #5 Shaun Tanney. <font color=yellow>#8 Alex Shoal</font> played as well but stayed in virtually the exact same position. Rounding out the top 10 we have a newcomer as <font color=yellow>#10 Ben Hart</font> flipped past previous champ Alvin van Asselt and Mickael Smolen with 5 PRs to reach the coveted pedestal.<br><br>Moving down the charts to the top 25 we don't have to go far to hit <font color=yellow>#12 Dustin Enders</font>, who shocked the world by hitting a massive 44 PRs and moving from #34 to sitting right outside the top 10. With this move he knocked out 27 AF points and came within inches of becoming MKW elite. Moving further, <font color=yellow>#16 Alvin Le and #22 Jamie Disley</font>, both played but Alvin dropped back a spot and Jamie stayed in place. Such are the curses of the MKW treadmill of horror.<br><br>Top 50 time, a lot of players were playing in this range. <font color=yellow>#35 Bob Holden #37 Max Anossow #39 Ricardo Costa</font> all kind of moved together, each gaining one, three, and five spots respectively and crushing some more players. Similarly <font color=yellow>#42 Oliver Martin #43 Henrik Distel #45 Ross Coleman</font> decide to pick up on the \"moving in threes\" trend with the first two gaining a place to stay together and Ross pushing past five players to solidify himself a place in the top 50. Finally <font color=yellow>#50 Franco Gubser</font> can pride himself on the fact that he is in another elite group and can move up to the next paragraph for news updating, as he moved up two spots with his 6 PRs, one of which happened to be a new site record.<br><br>Next is the 51-100 group, who only had only had six players playing in total. Good news for those six, keep playing and you'll pass some inactive players. <font color=yellow>#55 Zane Royal and #56 Nate Paternost</font> both cut off some AF, with Zane playing enough to hold a two point AF lead over Nate, who jumped two players to land behind him. Another pair emerges a litte while down. <font color=yellow>#63 Ashley O'Hara and #64 Joshua Reinshagen</font> both played, with very different outcomes. Ashley PRed three times and cut four spots, which is an impressive feat especially because one of the PRs was a site record. I really wish I could cut a place for each PR I hit. Joshua tops that feat by breaking into the Top 100 all the way from #121 with his 53 PRs. An impressive move for him as he hopes to climb further into the mix. <font color=yellow>#70 Lars Riecken</font> tried to follow Joshua after he saw that great move, coming from #94 to #70 with 21 PRs, again over a place per PR. <br><br>In other news, also known as the below the 100 zone, <font color=yellow>#116 Dexter Howe</font> PRed once, but dropped a spot. <font color=yellow>#135 Ryan Trovillion</font> moved up one spot with his two PRs. If he keeps playing he should vault a few spots with the general inactivity of the \"Below 100th group\". <font color=yellow>#137 Zack Weber</font> gained a spot with one PR but lost AF, which makes no sense, but again this is MKW. Moving much much further down to the 300s range, we find the next active player in <font color=yellow>#330 Kristopher Lamp</font>, who moved up two spots with 56 PRs, which is really depressing but it can be overcome. The only thing I can say is keep watching videos and karting so you can move away from the 300s and come further up the charts!<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>A quiet week in the site records world for everyone two players who improved their own records.<br><font color=yellow>Fabien Jacques </font>beat his own old <font color=orange>Maple Treeway flap</font> time of 44\"665 with a time of: <font color=magenta>44\"648</font><br><font color=yellow>Ashley O'Hara </font>beat his own old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'13\"347 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'13\"331</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Well this is suprising.

        "content": "<p><b>Another week in the life of MKW. Well anyway, let's get to the news.<br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>I'm starting with these since I'm happy that I kept up with my promise of delivering new awards, and also probably because everyone hasn't seen it in a while. However, I lied last week about how I would update them. Instead of going backwards, it was easier to start from where they left off (somewhere back in May of 2009). So if you're waiting for an award from June/July 2010, then you might have to wait a little longer as I continue to battle through the stats program to find the bests of the week/month/quarter, etc.<br><br>Since these people didn't really get any recognition for their efforts, I'm going to post here all the POM and POQ awards that were given out this past week. I would do all of the POW people that were new, but that would be slightly ridiculous, so I figure you can just click on the awards tab if you want to see the details.<br><br><u>The New POM's</u><br>May 2009 - <font color=yellow>Keiron Moseley</font><br>June 2009 - <font color=yellow>Mickael Smolen</font><br>July 2009 - <font color=yellow>David McPartland</font><br>August 2009 - <font color=yellow>Marc Bas</font><br>September 2009 - <font color=yellow>Robert van Zanten</font><br><br><u>The New POQ's</u><br>2nd Quarter, 2009 - <font color=yellow>Marc Bas</font><br>3rd Quarter, 2009 - <font color=yellow>James Richards</font><br><br>And for this month, if you were wondering, the July POM goes to <font color=yellow>Dustin Enders</font>, who finished out the last two weeks of July strong with a cut from #32 --> #12. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Two new players this week. What happened to the rush of new competitors?<br><font color=lime>David Landy</font> joined with a good starting set of couse times. Now all he needs to do is submit his flaps before the Course AF chart might possibly at some point get removed.<br><font color=lime>Jay Batten</font> joins with the same 32 times. Very good for just joining the site, as he has already mastered the sub 1:10 on LC.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Other than the newcomers, 44 players were active this week.<br>Starting in the top 10 <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade's</font> kept playing and pushing further away from the competition. Even though he hit only one new PR, he still showed his power at the top. <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas and #6 Jimmy Benson</font> played enough to retain their places, which was a good thing because <font color=yellow>#7 Ben Hart</font> stormed in with 7 new PRs. Just making it into the top 10 last week, he wasn't done there. Ben moved up three spots with a 2 point AF cut. Jimmy better watch his back. <font color=yellow>#9 Alex Shoal</font> unfortunately was a victim of this move, even though he hit a new SR at SGB he couldn't stop from moving down a place.<br><br><br>In the 11-25 range, <font color=yellow>#11 Dustin Enders</font> is at it again, knocking over another player this week with 7 new PRs. His 2% cut was enough to pass Mick to be within one place of moving up to the top 10 zone. <font color=yellow>#17 Eric Hacksell and #18 Leif Leopold</font> decided to partner up and moved up two places each. Eric pulled out 7 records and Leif pulled out 18 and a new SR, but they both stayed within breathing distance of each other. A little further down, <font color=yellow>#23 Tony Ruiz</font> moved past one unlucky karter to try and catch the Hacksell-Leopold Express.<br><br>In the top 50 <font color=yellow>#26 Marvin Rekovsky, #27 Fabien Jacques, and #35 Bob Holden</font> all played but stay in the same posistion. It takes searching to find <font color=yellow>#44 Stacy Needham</font>, who knocked out 20 PRs and moved up five spots to avoid dropping out of the top 50 group. He even passed <font color=yellow>#45 Ross Coleman</font>, who played three new records this week and <font color=yellow>#46 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who found himself one spot above Stacy but this week is two spots below even though he cut two spots. You have to stay on top of things if you want to even hold ground in the land of MKW.<br><br>Reaching the realm of 51-100, they were much more active then usual. Maybe its the satisfaction that you just hit the top 100, but no one ever seems to play here. It's always a great advantage for people like <font color=yellow>#52 Zane Royal</font> the rMR expert, who dropped 5 PRs, and moved up three places. <font color=yellow>#54 Gavin Price</font> 1-uped this move (excuse the Mario pun) by sprinting from 62nd place to his current position and putting him in great contention for POW. <font color=yellow>#60 Paul-Phillip Baehr, #61 Ashley O'Hara, and #62 Joshua Reinshagen</font>  almost beat the feat of Eric and Leif above. Joshua and Ashley moved up two places each to catch Paul, who cut two points of AF but didn't move. Maybe they are making preparations to hit the top 50?  <font color=yellow>#69 Sebastian Wimmer</font> doesn't really care if they are or not, all he cares about is the fact that he passed three inactive players with 14 new PRs. <font color=yellow>#73 Emmanuel Amador</font> takes a 2 point cut to move up a spot and make room for <font color=yellow>#74 Sophie Steiner</font>, who is trying to take the women's overall title of MKW. Sophie moved up three spots with a nice 8 PRs. <font color=yellow>#84 Thibaud Bourdeau</font> takes a three spot move, and <font color=yellow>#90 Luke Berrill</font> knocks away 7 players. Finally <font color=yellow>#97 Marcus Wood</font> noticed he had three digits after his place and wanted to fix that, moving from #100 up three places. Plus you don't want to be in the next paragraph. No one really reads that paragraph (actually they might even not be reading this one)<br><br>In the unread paragraph of 101 and beyond, <font color=yellow>#127 Noah Gordan</font> cutz ties with the 130s with a nice four place move. Finally <font color=yellow>#140 Sam Smith</font> moved up two places with 8 new records. Wow this is a short paragraph. I wish I could say something else about it, but no wonder no one reads it. I guess its onto the site records then.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>This week fared much better than last, with four new site records.<br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>crushes the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> time of 1'49\"866 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"350</font><br><font color=yellow>Leif Leopold </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins lap</font> time of 0'33\"545 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"399</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach crs</font> time of 1'22\"604 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'22\"525</font><br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach lap</font> time of 0'25\"325 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'25\"287</font><br><br>With ROM's new record, he is now the sole holder of the most site records as Jorge was knocked down to 6.<br><br>Also the POW 1 for August will be awarded next update since I want to wait until August 7th to check the stats.<br><br>I got everyone who moved up a spot this week....I think. I'm never really sure. If you saw the stats page you'd probably get a headache from the amount of numbers on the screen. So until next week, keep karting!<br><br>-Web</p>",

So sorry for the bad news, but they'll be caught up soon.<br><br>Now to the movement and such.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Three newbies join the site this week.<br><font color=lime>R Janssen</font> felt like being mysterious about his first name and joined the site with 35 times, all the courses and three flaps. With those times he's in the 280s, but with the rest of his timesheet he could move up drastically.<br><font color=lime>Jonathon Jones</font> joins with the usual 32 course times, that would rank him 307th if he kept that pace.<br><font color=lime>Evan Simmons</font> was the most impressive newbie this time around, with his course-only timesheet he slots in at about 247th. Flaps always help your AF so once these times get submitted Evan should shoot up the charts as well as the other newcomers.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>40 players picked up their WiiChucks, Classics, and GCN Controllers (and maybe wheels) this week to kart.<br><br>The top 10 was pretty quiet this week, with players 1-6 not PRing at all. Moving to the next spot, <font color=yellow>#7 Ben Hart</font> continued his strong run of the past two weeks by PRing 8 more times. It didn't push him up any spots, but he did kick off an AF point. With the top seemingly quiet maybe Ben can make a run for the top five. <font color=yellow>#8 Tyler McNell</font> woke up to the fact that he got passed last week and tried to claw his 7th spot back. Unfortunately for him Ben played enough to stay away, but Tyler made a 2% cut with 7 PRs. <font color=yellow>#9 Alex Shoal</font> has gotten unlucky for the past couple weeks. For the last three weeks he's played but dropped in AF. This week he got another two PRs and improved on his own site record, but he lost half a point. Hopefully Alex can see those nice bolded white numbers on the AF chart soon.<br><br>Moving down to the 11-25 karters, those that are so close to the elite top group but still have to cut AF to get there, only one player did anything. <font color=yellow>#21 Robert van Zanten</font> took advantage of the fact that no one else played around him to hit 4 PRs and move up three spots. With that nice 7% cut RVZ avoided moving down into the next group and got an entire paragraph written about him.<br><br>26-50 seemed pretty happy about the fact that only four out of the top 25 played, because this is where all the activity happened. <font color=yellow>#26 Marvin Rekovsky and #27 Fabien Jacques</font> stick together from last week and make small 1 and 2 PR cuts, respectively. Both lost AF, but if they push a little more next week they should have no problem breaking into the sleeping 11-25 range. <font color=yellow>#36 Hendrik Boss</font> comes out of nowhere to move from 78th place with a 55 point cut. He would have had the POW but since he improved on every course it was kind of obvious that he hoarded his times. This is still a very impressive move for being inside the top 100. Next up come <font color=yellow>#37 Henrik Distel and #38 Max Anossow</font>, who switched spots from last time even though they both played and hit 9 PRs each. They are only separated by .2 AF points, so if Max hits another site record like he did this week he might flip the standings again. Next comes <font color=yellow>#40 Oliver Martin</font>, who cut only half a point of AF but moved up three spots. The tightness of the 26-50 shows that if you don't play, you drop like a rock. <font color=yellow>#45 Ross Coleman</font> stays square at 45th place but cuts almost an entire AF point, which goes against what I just said about Oliver's cut. Finally we have some newcomers to the group. <font color=yellow>#49 Zane Royal</font> moves in from 52nd with 16PRs including a Site Record at rMR, and <font color=yellow>#50 Gavin Price</font> follows him from 54th with 10 personal records and a healthy 5% cut.<br><br>After the happiness of the 26-50 range, 51-100 fell into a deep depression because they realized that they were never active. Only six players played here, making it easy for them to make cuts among the dead other players in the group. <font color=yellow>#54 Tim van Ham</font> just barely missed escaping this graveyard and moved up two spots with 10 new PRs. You can almost see the light of the top 50 Tim! Keep going! <font color=yellow>#61 Joshua Reinshagen and #62 Yannick Wiesner</font> banded together to move up. Joshua moved up a spot from 62nd to make room for Yannick who cut three spots to fill the empty position. <font color=yellow>#79 Thibaud Bourdeau</font> moves up five places this week into the top 80, which really isn't a landmark but it pushes him much closer to the front. <font color=yellow>#87 Luke Berrill</font> tries to find Thibaud, but can only push past three players in his quest to escape the 51-100s. Finally <font color=yellow>#95 Marcus Wood</font> defies all logic. Last week Marcus played to avoid dropping out of the top 100. This week he PRed once which made him cut his losses to only .3 AF. However this wasn't a huge deal, as he also hurdled two players while moving backwards. Maybe he can escape this zone of inactivity eventually, or maybe just avoid what lies below.<br><br>Even after mentioning how easy it was to move up in this range last week only four players played. <font color=yellow>#115 Dexter Howe</font> seems eternally locked at this position, hitting another PR but not cutting any AF. Dropping to <font color=yellow>#137 Zack Weber</font> we find he didn't move up at all either but with three PRs at least cut some AF to shorter the gap. Apparently only <font color=yellow>#145 Jamal Fluellen</font> took my advice this week. He moved up from 152nd with a good 10 point AF cut. If he keeps playing like this in a few weeks he should make it to the next group. Last, but not least (because there are another 100 or so players below him) <font color=yellow>#217 Florian Chollet</font> goes with a minimalistic attitude, getting two PRs and moving up two spots. At least the 101 and beyonds beat the 11-25 range this week.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Five improvements this week, but not much changed hands as four just improved their own PRs.<br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>got much closer to the <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> sub, breaking the old time of 1'49\"350 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"146</font><br><font color=yellow>Jazz Ahmed </font>knocked a whole tenth off of the old <font color=orange>Moonview Highway crs</font> time of 1'43\"842 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'43\"752</font><br><font color=yellow>Zane Royal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway crs</font> time of 1'42\"423 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'42\"368</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>decided to beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach crs</font> time of 1'22\"525 for the second time in two weeks withh a time of: <font color=magenta>1'22\"511</font><br><font color=yellow>Max Anossow </font>was the only person not to improve his own record. He beat the old <font color=orange>N64 DK's Jungle Parkway lap</font> time of 0'41\"696 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'41\"518</font><br><br>So in the overall records table, Marc Bas dropped back to third overall from his tie for second with Jorge, and Max joins near the bottom, tied for 15th with one record. MKW has so many course specialists its crazy.<br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Well none of the older awards were taken care of, but there was enough time to recognize a new record holder.<br><font color=yellow>Ben Hart </font> takes the POW for Week 1 of August 2009 with a nice cut all the way from 10th to 7th. Cutting three spots in the top 10 is not an easy task.<br><br>Okay, I think I have this whole news updating thing down. Now that it's been three weeks I should stop making at least one typo with every update...maybe. Good luck karting this week everyone!<br><br>-Web</p>",

        "title": "The Long-Awaited News Update of Shame and Embarassment",
        "content": "<p><b>First off, before you even begin to read anything that is posted below, I would like to extend my sincere apologies to the MarioKart Wii community and all of the MK pages for not keeping this updated for a month and a half. Summer work and school got in the way, but now that I've started them, they'll be updated every two weeks at the least, and most likely weekly.<br><br>Also I’d like to expand my great thanks to Nick Meade, who basically kept the updating going while I wasn’t around. Seriously, he’s #1, a moderator, and updates the site. What can’t he do?<br><br>In regards to awards, they'll be covered this weekend, I'll get a whole quarter done. Getting the ball back on track with the news should spark activity and I always like to see activity. Plus you get to see me suffer by writing this update.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Here we go, 16 new players in the last month and a half. <br><font color=lime>Kyle R, Salvatore Salamo, Viktor Silivanov, Yann Bertheaud, Sean Wilson, Daniel Raftery, Sean Thurgood, Audrey Myers, Dilan Arse, Danny Gallenberger</font> all joined the site in the time I was gone, and are probably really annoyed at the fact that they couldn’t get mentioned until now. For the sake of keeping my sanity, I’ll just give a summary of those that have 64/64 submissions since they had an impact on the AF ranks, and the rest get to hover in the nice bubble of lime at the top of this paragraph.<br><br><font color=lime>Lucas Acek</font> popped in at #23, a very impressive spot for the game being out for two years. <br><font color=lime>Matthieu Mayer</font> slots in at #103, which is quite annoyingly close to the fabled Top 100. Maybe we’ll see him join this elite group soon.<br><font color=lime>Christian Nemetz</font> knocks on the door of the 150s and is just barely allowed in, moving in at #147 for now.<br>Close behind is <font color=lime>Lukas Gabmann</font>, who joins at #153 and looks longingly at the nice 150 door.<br>MKDD and MK64 pro <font color=lime>Christian Wild</font> decides to expand his abilities to a new kart game and joins at #218.<br>Finally <font color=lime>Bernardo De Jans</font> sits just barely below, at #224.<br>The rest didn’t submit 64 times so didn’t earn a spot on the AF chart. Now onto the movement portion of our program.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Painfully enough for me, 95 players were active in the time that I was gone, and in my normal updating fashion I’ll at least mention everyone that cut AF, however the higher up you are the higher chance you have of getting mentioned.<br><br>Despite the long period of no news updates, only four of the top 10 actually submitted a PR. As always, <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade</font> was karting and improving his lead on any challengers. With 11 PRs, he has now pushed past the 1 AF lead again and is still going strong. Next we move to  former #2 <font color=yellow>#5 Shaun Tanney</font>, who made a nice comeback after a long period of inactivity, PRing a quarter of his timesheet and gaining back some precious AF. <font color=yellow>#7 Tyler McNell</font> submitted 9 PRs, lost AF, but ended up moving up a spot. It’s nice when logic contradicts itself like that. Finally <font color=yellow>#9 Alex Shoal</font> hit 7 new marks to cut his losses slightly. The fact that the Top 10 is so inactive means that the other groups below should pick up on this and get ready to make some moves.<br><br>In 11-25 land, a few of the karters decided to listen to the message a few lines above and try to make their moves while the Top 10 was quiet. <font color=yellow>#16 Mark Schmidt and #18 Alvin Le</font>  both had a couple PRs but this couldn’t stop them from losing some AF.  <font color=yellow>#21 Robert van Zanten</font> played just enough to hold of <font color=yellow>#22 Tony Ruiz</font>, who kicked off 16 old times and moved up two places to clock in right behind RVZ. Finally <font color=yellow>#24 Joe Sebeny</font> hit one PR, but still got passed by Tony and newcomer Lucas.<br>The 26-50 range always seems to be the most active week in and week out, however this week they were relatively quiet. <font color=yellow>#26  Fabien Jacques</font> bumped himself up a spot from the last update and just narrowly missed out on being mentioned in the next paragraph above. He was followed close behind by his once partner in crime <font color=yellow>#28 Marvin Rekovsky</font>, who played but lost two places, and Luigi Circuit king <font color=yellow>#29 James Pierrepont</font> pushed forwards a place. <font color=yellow>#37 Henrik Distel</font> cuts some AF but stays in place, while <font color=yellow>#40 Oliver Martin and #41 Ricardo Costa</font> start to sneak up on his back, Martin cutting 7% of AF and Costa moving up a spot. <font color=yellow>#44 Salvatore Bellusci</font> makes the largest move so far, displacing three unhappy karters and solidifying himself a spot in the Top 50. Finally <font color=yellow>#48 Gavin Price</font> hangs on to the Top 50 for dear life as he moves up two spots from last time in order to keep his place in this great group.<br><br>Normally I always make some joke about 51-100, since they never really play and get excited about having two digits in their place so they take a break. This time they decided to prove me completely wrong and have fun with a plethora of activity. <font color=yellow>#53 Tim van Ham</font> pushes on and upwards a place, striving for the Top 50 as his next goal with 13 PRs. <font color=yellow>#55 Joshua Reinshagen</font> makes a very nice move all the way from 61st with some new marks. <font color=yellow>#61 Yannick Wiesner and #63 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> move as a unit, with Yannick squeezing out a once place move and Paul-Phillipp watching for his turn to strike. <font color=yellow>#64 Simone Bertini</font> makes an outstanding jump; 9 places from #73. <font color=yellow>#68 Sebastian Wimmer and #69 Lars Reicken</font> stay neck-and-neck, each knocking down two karters in order to stick together. Resident auto-noob <font color=yellow>#76 Jon Coppernol</font> hits 18 PRs and moves up a position. Now we hit a random period of inactivity, like only the first half of this group listened to my recommendation. No one else in the group made any sort of AF cut, and the PRs hit by these karters were 5 and under. Judging by the fact that on average the inactives moved down five spots in the time of no updates, you could be out of the top 100 in a month or so. <br><br>Now we go to the blissfully ignorant 101 and below group, where movement is seldom and the treadmill effect is at its greatest.  <font color=yellow>#111 Dexter Howe</font> decided to drop the “Forever 115th” moniker and move up four spots, desperately trying to sprint on the treadmill (which never really ends well). <font color=yellow>#140 Sam Smith</font> PRed 15 times, cut three AF, but stayed in exactly the same spot. That really sucks, for the lack of a better term. <font color=yellow>#151 Loric Guillian</font> took all the luck and moved up ten positions with a five point cut. <font color=yellow>#190 Michael Timpe</font> had a great seven place move to avoid dropping into the 200 range. Finally we reach <font color=yellow>#263 Murray Wright</font>, who might even have worse luck then Sam. He hit 37 PRs but only moved up two spots. Such is the ever-depressing realm of 101 and beyond. Now on to the new site records. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>Quite a ridiculous amount of Site Records fell. In the chart of overall record holders, Reiner de Jonge goes on a huge SR spree, adding four to his total and grabbing the overall lead. Nick Meade joins in on the fun, going from 4 to 6 records. The victims of this move are Marc Bas and Jorge Hernandez, who both drop to 4 PRs respectively.<br><br><font color=yellow>Cookie Sancez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'39\"324 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"497</font><br><font color=yellow>Cookie Sancez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'11\"111 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'10\"145</font><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 0'36\"292 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"703</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Both </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine lap</font> time of 0'09\"597 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"443</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time of 2'18\"354 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'17\"935</font><br><font color=yellow>Reinier de Jonge </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 crs</font> time of 0'53\"386 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'53\"384</font><br><font color=yellow>Reinier de Jonge </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway crs</font> time of 1'42\"368 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'42\"272</font><br><font color=yellow>Reinier de Jonge </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway lap</font> time of 0'31\"642 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31\"597</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach crs</font> time of 1'22\"511 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'22\"472</font><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium lap</font> time of 0'35\"897 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"801</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills crs</font> time of 1'35\"517 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'35\"466</font><br><font color=yellow>Dylan Imhoff </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 crs</font> time of 1'59\"217 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'59\"038</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 lap</font> time of 0'38\"339 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"276</font><br><font color=yellow>Reinier de Jonge </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Mario Circuit 3 crs</font> time of 1'18\"425 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'18\"369</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'31\"988 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'31\"763</font><br><br>I know you want to burn me at the stake now, but hopefully I’ve pleased you enough so I don’t get killed within the next few hours.

        "content": "<p><b>Normally I would be commenting on how the week's news had gone so far except for the fact that it has been about a month since the last update. So in that respect, I guess I can't really say much about how the last week has gone and in turn I'll talk about the month. Also I had no creativity going so this update doesn't have a title. Sorry if you really enjoy reading witty titles, but I was out of them.<br><br>I want to address a point that has recently arisen on the forums about the news updating. Some of you have commented on the fact that I have let these updates slide, and I 100% agree with you. With that in mind, recently I gave Nick Meade the link to the stats program, so he'll be helping us out with updates and probably doing a much better job then I am now. For now I think to get an update per week we could switch off every week and that way you karters would get your news from someone much more reliable then I have been. Although I do want to say that I have just cleared up a lot of time in my schedule since I'm not doing Indoor Track this year, so the news updates should be fine until March.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br><font color=lime>John Brunn, Sebastian Gomez, Ricardo Fanaticus, Octavio Muniz, Stefan Herzberg, Dylan Bon, Julian Stephens, Mathieu Ammouial, Tobias Schamburek</font> joined the cult of  MKW in the last month, and all look to advance up the charts in the future. Jay Batten jumped in at the mid-50s but otherwise the players had mostly unfinished sets of times and need to fill out their timesheets before they can join the AF ranks.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>78 Players were active in the last month, and everyone that has a full timesheet and cut AF will get mentioned.<br><br>Starting at the top of the mountain, <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade</font> pushed out his lead to 1.3 AF with 5 PRs, and continued his dominance at the top. The activity at the very top has been very quiet recently, and Nick has never stopped playing. Moving further down the pinnacle of the MKW universe, <font color=yellow>#7 Tyler McNell</font> always seems to be playing alongside Nick, and this time he doubled the champ's PR count. He hit 10 new marks and is now within .2 points of catching #6 Jimmy Benson and finally move up after all of his time spent karting. <font color=yellow>#8 Alex Shoal</font> who isn't quitting anymore (at least I think so) moved up a spot after Ben Hart was hit hard by a 2 AF loss due to the treadmill effect. These three karters have always kept playing for the last few months where others have faltered, and due to this keep moving up and getting closer to the top. <br><br>Looking longingly at the fabled Top 10 is <font color=yellow>#11 Mark Schmidt </font>, who hurdled five players, a huge amount of ground for being this high on the rankings. All it took him was five PRs, which shows the closeness of this group and how little it actually takes for people to drop on the charts. Some of those unfortunate few were <font color=yellow>#12 Dustin Enders</font> and <font color=yellow>#14 Mickael Smolen</font>, both of whom karted and dropped a spot due to Mark's great move. <font color=yellow>#13 Eric Hacksell</font> attempted to follow with a nice four place move of his own from 17th, and in the process passed both Mick and Alvin van Asselt, two of the game's all-time greats. <font color=yellow>#16 Cole Gilbert</font>, aka king of the random comeback submitted two records but fell victim to Eric and Mark's great jumps. Slightly lower down we find <font color=yellow>#18 Tony Ruiz</font>, who moves four places to clump in right behind this strong group of movers. <font color=yellow>#22 Robert van Zanten and #23 Joe Sebeny</font> both lose AF but have different results, RVZ losing a place and PrezEvil gaining one. They should continue to pick up the controllers if they want to stay ahead of <font color=yellow>#25 Fabien Jacques</font>, who finally made the push into the Top 25 with an impressive 11 PRs. <br><br>Another section down but the same result, <font color=yellow>#26 Marvin Rekovsky</font> is pulling a Schmidt-esque \"on the outside looking in\" trick. He jumped two places to slot in one place below the impressive Top 25 group. <font color=yellow>#31 Salvatore Bellusci</font> sends in a massive 44 PRs and jumps up all the way from 44th. Apparently 44 is his lucky number, maybe we'll see some 44 related news next week. <font color=yellow>#38 Rachel Emerson</font> is trying to disprove the whole mantra that chicks can't kart, and goes from #45 with 14 PRs of her own. She is closely followed by <font color=yellow>#42 Gavin Price</font>, who started at #48 from last month and slowly worked his way up six places. <font color=yellow>#47 Zane Royal</font> makes a grand return to the top 50 from #52, maybe we'll see him make a grand return to rMR as well? Finally <font color=yellow>#50 Tim van Ham</font> moves up three spots, displacing <font color=yellow>#51 Ross Coleman</font> who played to no avail.<br><br>After defying my whole system of what groups are in what paragraphs, we move on to the 51-100 group. Here <font color=yellow>#52 Daniel Boettcher and #54 Paul-Phillip Baehr</font> make strides of their own with 9 and 17 new marks respectively. Paul moved up from 63rd and Daniel lost AF but a spot as well, hopefully he'll recover soon. After newbie <font color=yellow>#56 Jay Batten</font> slotted in at his new spot moving everyone else down a spot, we find <font color=yellow>#68 Agustin Berrios</font>, who seems to be moving every week, this time from 75th. Close on his heels was <font color=yellow>#70 Sofie Wimmer</font>, who jumped ten places this time around. Possibly the best display of hoarding in the entire history of the universe, or just a random epiphany of karting skills must have taken place last month, since <font color=yellow>#75 Bernardo De Jans</font> jumped from #224, beating every single one of his PRs. Someone must have taken some kart-roids or something, because that move is insane. Finally <font color=yellow>#80 Thibaud Bordeau</font> and <font color=yellow>#84 Matthieu Mayer</font> had impressive moves of their own, Mayer joining the Top 100 for the first time and Thibaud making strides in the 80s range.<br><br>The last group of all, 101 and beyond finds a regular as always and the lack of activity to follow. <font color=yellow>#111 Dexter Howe</font> stayed in place but cut AF as usual, and maybe he'll get the Top 100 berth that he deserve soon enough.

In two weeks he should have his own account. Anyway, on to his written update.<br><br>Some of you may be wondering why there is (again) another news writer. To answer that question, it is because Zack has become extremely busy, and as you have seen, there has been gapped news updates, so now, I have become a news writer myself. Zack and I will switch off every Sunday for a news update, so expect a news update every week from now on.<br>I titled this entry Reformation because Zack and I have recently worked on getting a new set of updaters for this site worked out. From this moment on, all of you can expect a times update every day. I'd like to introduce and thank the following new times updaters: <font color=lime> Mickael \"Mick\" Smolen, Oliver \"Oli2210\" Martin, Christian \"Chris\" Wild, Timur \"Zweibel\" Ahmad, and Robert \"Robman60\" Lee.</font>  Furthermore, I hope by finally having set updates everyday, you, the players, will be more motivated when playing.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br><font color=lime>Lee Robbins</font> was the only new player of this week.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>In the universe of MKW, 30 people were active this week, so lets see what progress has been made.<br><br>For the first time in a while, the Top 10 had very quiet activity. Despite this, <font color=yellow>#8 Alex Shoal</font> took advantage of this, sending in 3 PRs this week, most notably some strong MC and rPG PRs, nice work Alex.<br><br>Progressing into the Top 25 area, just like the Top 10 area, it was relatively quiet this week. The only person who seems to have taken advantage of this situation was the sneaky <font color=yellow>#23 Marvin Rekovsky</font>, who set 8 PRs this week. Marvin set a nice DC PR this week, as well as some other flaps. With his PR string, he sneaked into the Top 25 from being #26 last week, nice going Marvin.<br><br>Going into Top 30 to Top 50 territory, here is where the real activity was happening. Knocking on the doorstep of the Top 30 comes <font color=yellow>#30 Salvatore Bellusci</font> Salvatore has been making consistent PRs for a while now, and with his 6 new PRs this week, he jumped from #31 to #30 to tie Gary Marcoz for the Top 30 spot. Right behind him comes the PR machine <font color=yellow> #32 Oliver Martin</font>. Oliver PRd on 15 tracks to cut 11 full AF points, and sky rocketed from #44 directly to #32. Keep a close eye on Oliver, if he keeps it up, you will see him in the Top 25 and even Top 25 at this rate. Right at the middle we arrive at <font color=yellow>#35 Rachel Emerson</font>. Rachel took advantage of this week with 6 new PRs to cut nearly 4 full AF points and jumped from #38 to #35 to close the week. Not too far behind Rachel comes <font color=yellow>#40 Gain Price</font>. Gavin is a new face to the Top 40, setting 7 PRs to have him go from #42 to #40. The last activity in this realm was <font color=yellow>#47 Zane Royal</font>. Even with 1 PR, he pushes himself a little closer to cutting deeper within the Top 50.<br><br>Adventuring into the 51-100 group, we are greeted by <font color=yellow>#55 Jay Batten</font>. Jay cut about 4 full AF points with 7 new PRs to push him up 1 overall place. Breathing down his neck comes <font color=yellow>#57 Yannick Wiesner</font>. Producing 9 new PRs, Yannick jumped from #63 to #57 with a 5 AF cut, arriving in the Top 60 now, nice work. In the middle of Top 70 we arrive at the beast <font color=yellow>#64 Matthieu Mayer</font>. Matthieu nearly improved half of his PRs, and shot up like a cannon from #84 to #64 for a monsterous 20 place cut. You'd better watch out Jay and Yannick, you can be sure that Matthieu will be right with you guys with time. Ending the activity of the Top 70 comes <font color=yellow>#69 Sofie Wimmer</font>. Setting 4 PRs, Sofie jumped one more place from #70 to #69 with almost a 3 AF cut. Topping off the activity of the Top 100 comes <font color=yellow>#86 Luke Berrill</font>. Luke took advantage of the inactivity of the people around him to set 8 fresh PRs to jump him over 4 AF and 4 overall places, nice job.<br><br>Outside the Top 100, we have some impressive activity to discuss. <font color=yellow>#115 John Brunn</font> decides to follow in the footsteps of Matthieu and cranked out 13 new PRs to cut him around 13 AF, pushing himself from #129 to #115, not very far from the Top 100. Virtually next to him is <font color=yellow>#117 Liam Lynch</font>. Like John, he would crank out a load of PRs but with an extra 2 more, setting 15 new PRs, resulting in an impressive 7 AF jump and 7 place cut. Just 3 places back comes both <font color=yellow>#120 Christian Nemetz</font> and <font color=yellow>#121 Sam Smith</font>. Both Christian and Sam had impressive weeks, setting 11 and 17 PRs, respectfully, yielding a 6 place jump for Christian and a 15 place cut for Sam. A fresh face to the Top 130 comes <font color=yellow>#129 Noah Gordon</font>. Setting only 3 PRs, he cut exactly 4 AF and snuck up 2 places from #131 to #129 to finish the week. Further on, <font color=yellow>#137 Loris Bagnasco</font> put up 1 new PR to stay active this week. Not too far behind, <font color=yellow>#144 Jamal Fluellen</font> sets an impressive 16 PRs to jump 6 overall places and nearly 10 AF, great job. Making a return to the MKW scene comes <font color=yellow>#146 Zack Weber</font>. Zack put up 8 new PRs to jump 2 overall places and close to 5 AF points. Hopefully this new activity by these players will provoke more to improve this week. To end the active players of this week comes <font color=yellow>#232 Andrea Gardina</font>, smashing 13 PRs to jump 5 places and 5 AF points.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Very quiet this week, only 2 new SRs were broken.<br><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Raftery </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano lap</font> time of 0'04\"525 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04\"524</font><br><font color=yellow>Reinier de Jonge </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway crs</font> time of 1'42\"272 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'42\"184</font><br>Honorable mention goes to Daniel Raftery for picking up his first WR on the GV flap, great job.<br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Hey guys, Web again. I decided to have a small interlude to mention that I've picked back up the awards (finally) and got another quarter down. The awards for 2009 and January 2010 are now finished, and more will come in the next week. I'm not making any promises (because you know how great I am at those), but I think I can get caught up by my next written update. <br><br>I'm not going to mention every POW, but I figured I'd give a long-awaited applause to the POM's and new POQ.<br><br><u>POM's</u><br>October 2009 - <font color=yellow>Jason Smith</font><br>November 2009 - <font color=yellow>Jamie Disley</font><br>December 2009 - <font color=yellow>Dustin Enders</font><br>January 2010 - <font color=yellow>Jimmy Benson</font><br><br><u>POQ</u><br>4th Quarter, 2009 - <font color=yellow>Jason Smith</font><br><br>Those are the awards, now back to Nick for the closing. <br><br>That basically ends this weeks activity.

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, Web here with an on time update. <br>Hopefully you've recovered from passing out by now, because I'm going to move on with the news update regardless. I was going to put a spin on this week's news update, but no one really decided to play, so it would be kind of pointless. We're going to go normal for this week and then I'll come up with something creative for next time.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br><br><font color=lime>Goulwen Boin</font> was the lone newbie and joined with 32 times, I'm assuming the courses. The times would slot in at 239th if they all were along the same lines as the courses, although since less people play flaps, I'm sure that if Goulwen completed their timesheet they would be higher than 239th on AF.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br><br>Weird how once regular news updates start coming in people stop playing. Only 24 active this time, so it’s going to be shorter than usual.<br><br>Normally there would be a paragraph about the top 10, but no one played in that group so I can’t say much. Everyone dropped about the same amount too so hopefully one of the toppies will pick up their controller to play.<br><br>The 11-25 range decided pick up a little bit of the slack, and put out one player that was active. <font color=yellow>#22 Mavin Rekovsky </font> submitted two PRs, which cut him about half a point of AF, but since he’s in one of those dead zones with a few AF points in front and behind him, he stayed exactly where he was. If he keeps playing and the rest of the group is dead he should be able to make some good strides through this group.<br><br>26-50 was the most active group of this update, which isn’t suprising since they normally play the most.  <font color=yellow>#29 Salvatore Bellusci</font> set five new marks and cut .7 AF. He stayed in place as well and still has a ways to go to move up a spot. Hopefully he can cut those three AF points soon. A little lower down <font color=yellow>#33 Rachel Emerson</font> is still defying the logic that “chicks can’t play kart”. The women’s champ of MKW moved up two places from 35th with two PRs of her own. Is she the highest ranked female in any kart game? I’m not sure, but she has to be up there. As everyone knows, you have to overcome a small amount of “driftback” in order to cut AF for the week. <font color=yellow>#40 Gavin Price</font>  had two PRs, but fell victim to the driftback and ended up losing about .01 AF. The good news is everyone around him lost about .2 - .5 AF, so he technically gained ground even though he lost it. Sorry that that sentence makes no sense. <font color=yellow>#48 Tim van Ham</font> solidified his position in the top 50 by moving from 50th up two places with 6 new PRs. Good thing he made the move, because recent newcomer to the full AF chart <font color=yellow>#49 Jay Batten</font> was hot on his heels. Jay moved from #55 to take Markus Hobelsberger out of the Top 50 with 15 PRs. <br><br>51-100 wasn’t very active this week either, although they never really are. (Although not as bad as the 100 and beyond group). <font color=yellow>#52 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> moved up two places from 54th, carried on the success of 13 new PRs. He cut 8 AF points which is very impressive and puts him less than two away from #50 Anis Taktak. <font color=yellow>#55 Matthieu Mayer</font> made another impressive move from #64  #55. He had a 10% AF cut and a 10 point cut due to 19 PRs. Finally <font color=yellow>#57 Yannick Wiesner</font> tried to chase Matthieu after being passed. He cut three AF and passed David Long, but got passed by Matthieu so he didn’t move any places. The last member in this group to touch a controller is <font color=yellow>#96  Michael Schneider</font>. He jumped all the way from #110 into the Top 100, taking Biagio Macula out of that illustrious group. Michael hit 29 PRs and cut 11 AF points in his move.<br><br>Finally, we reach the 101+ group. <font color=yellow>#113 John Brunn</font> hit 9 PRs and moved up two spots with a 5.8 AF cut. Following closely behind him is <font color=yellow>#116 Christian Nemetz</font>, who hit 13 PRs and moved up four spots from 120th. <font color=yellow>#120 Noah Gordon</font> made a nice cut of two places with 4 PRs. Yes I had to try really hard not to use his username pun, before you ask. <font color=yellow>#125 Sam Smith</font> hit three PRs but it wasn’t enough for him to cut any AF points, although he still moved up two places due to the closeness of the 120s. A little lower down we find <font color=yellow>#137 Loris Bagnasco</font>, who cut 1.8 AF points to stay in 137th place.  A mention goes to <font color=yellow>#138 Evan Simmons</font>, who hit 19 PRs and finally finished out his timesheet to slot in at 138th on the overall chart. Let’s see if he can move up in the future weeks. <font color=yellow>#175 Christian Wild</font> had one PR and lost some AF, but has one of the most unbalanced timesheets on the site, which shows he’s just worked on some courses much more than others. Once he starts to balance it out he could be a serious top 100 contender. Last, but not least is <font color=yellow>#202 Adam Gilbert Pelling</font>. AGP hit nine PRs and improved from 205th. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>None. This completely blew my mind. The one good thing that you can take from this is it truly shows how MKW is maturing as a game. The fact that the records are starting to be good to the point that they can last the test of time shows how far the game has truly come.<br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br><br>Yep, I kept my word on this one too. After my short interlude from last week, I continued with awards. As usual there are too many POWs for me to mention them all, and I’m going to wait to award a POW for the current dates until I catch up to it, but it shouldn’t be long now since I’m going to start the third quarter of 2010 (July, August, and September) in the next few days after writing this update.<br><br>Anyway, the new POM’s and POQ’s from last week are below.<br><br><u>POM's</u><br>February 2010 - <font color=yellow>Jason Smith</font><br>March 2010 - <font color=yellow>Jimmy Benson</font><br>April 2010 - <font color=yellow>Robert van Zanten</font><br>May 2010 - <font color=yellow>Werth Rath</font><br>June 2010 - <font color=yellow>Mickael Smolen</font><br><br><u>POQ’s</u><br>1st Quarter, 2010 - <font color=yellow>Jimmy Benson</font><br>2nd Quarter, 2010 - <font color=yellow>Eric Hacksell</font><br><br>By the next time I update I should have the awards completely caught up to today, which means that the November 2010 POM and all awards beforehand will be covered. So the awards are much more caught up then you think. It’s been a lot of work but they needed to be done.<br><br><br>Anyway, that’s all for this week. Nick will most likely have his account by next week so he should be posting the next update, and I’ll see you guys in two weeks!<br><br>-Web<br></p>",

I hope you guys are enjoying our weekly news updates now.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br><font color=lime>Tyler Reyes</font> and <font color=lime>Dave Tandy</font> joined the group of MKW players during this week.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>During the Thanksgiving week, 28 people were active.<br><br>The Top 10 had two players active this week as opposed to none from last week. Staring at <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade</font>, Nick only made 1 little PR and gained no places at all, so Nick only gained 1 place of lost AF from inactivity. <font color=yellow>#8 Alex Shoal</font> is the other player who played this week. Alex decided to do the 1 PR trick Nick did and didn't cut any AF, but gained 1 place back of AF lost in recent weeks.<br><br>Going to the Top 25, it didn't really look all that different than the Top 10 this week. <font color=yellow>#11 Mark Schmidt </font> decided to play this week in Top 25 land. Mark continued in the footsteps of Alex and Nick, but inevitably gained positive AF with his 1 PR. Barely 1 AF point is separating him and James Richards from the Top 10, will Mark push on and take him over? I guess you will have to wait some weeks and see what happens! You would have never expected this, but we were greeted with 1 new PR and WR from an old former World Champion! <font color=yellow>#15 Alvin van Asselt</font> made a surprising return this week with a new WR on the rDS flap WR, being the first to sub 39 on the flap, congratulations!<br><br>Walking away from Top 25 territory, you may be thinking, \"where is the activity going to pick up?\" It all started when we progress to the 26-50 ranks. <font color=yellow>#29 Salvatore Bellusci</font> started off this section with a good chunk of PRs, making a bigger gap from him and the rest of the people waiting to join the Top 30 group. Coming along nicely is <font color=yellow>#30 Oliver Martin</font>. Oliver submits 2 PRs this week but gains enough AF to push himself from #32 to #30 arriving at the Top 30 slot, nicely done Oliver. Not too far away is <font color=yellow>#39 Gavin Price</font>, who drove 2 PRs like Oliver this week, and pushes himself 1 rank closer to the Top 30. Farther back we arrive to the interesting trio of <font color=yellow>#47 Jay Batten, #48 Zane Royal, and #49 Tim van Ham</font>. These guys had quite the interesting week here. We start off with Jay who makes 6 PRs and leap frogs over Zane and Tim in the process. Zane isn't affected by this outburst of PRs and makes 5 PRs of his own to avoid losing more overall places on the AF charts than he could have, setting in at #48. Tim does what he can with 1 PR but gets pushed from #48 to #49 this week. Will Zane and Tim try to seek their vengeance on Jay, or will Jay keep pushing on? Let's wait and see :P<br><br>Moving on to 51-100 territory, we are greeted first with <font color=yellow>#55 Stacy Needham</font>. Stacy makes a nice 5 PRs and cuts around 3 AF, jumping a place and getting closer to the Top 50. Not very far behind we meet <font color=yellow>#59 Sebastian Wimmer</font>. Sebastian made the 2nd biggest cut of the whole update, making a huge 29 PR string to cut himself 15 AF and catapult from #72 all the way to #59, great job. Only a few places behind, <font color=yellow>#66 Agustin Berrios</font> goes on a huge PR spree himself with 18 PRs to cut 4 places to #66. <font color=yellow>#69 Sofie Wimmer</font> played and made 4 PRs this week to secure the #69th spot to end off the week. This concludes the 51-100 activity.<br><br>Out to the 100 and onwards territory comes the last 8 active people of this week. Coming dangerously close to the Top 100 is <font color=yellow>#110 John Brunn</font>. John made a great 9 PR string to push himself 3 more places from #113 last week to #110 this week, continue PRing like that and you will expect Top 100 in no time. <font color=yellow>#112 Dexter Howe</font> found himself being leapfrogged as well being pushed back from #111 to #112 because of John but he still plays and puts forth 1 PR this week to stand firmly at #112. If Dexter didn't think that was enough, exactly 1 place behind him comes <font color=yellow>#113 Christian Nemetz</font>. Being one of the most active of this week, Christian made 12 PRs to push himself 3 places to #113 being less than half an AF point behind Dexter. <font color=yellow>#117 Liam Lynch</font> decided to join the \"big PR spree\" group this week, making 7 PRs this week and picking up 1 placement in advancement. Journeying to the middle of the Top 130 comes <font color=yellow>#124 Sam Smith</font>, who made 2 PRs this week but cuts another place closer to the Top 120. 12 places back is <font color=yellow>#136 Loris Bagnasco</font>, submitting 6 PRs, and like Sam, pushed forward 1 more place this week. <font color=yellow>#148 Zack Weber</font> kept his activity alive with 1 PR this week and stayed right in place to stand his ground this week. Coming to the most active player of this week, <font color=yellow>#155 Christian Wild</font> does some insane work! Would you like to know what he did this week? If not, too bad, I'll tell you anyway. Christian decided to make at least 1 PR on every single track in this game to cut 20 overall places and comes barreling to #155. I don't remember the last time someone had done this before, this is quite the feat, Christian. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br><font color=yellow>Fabien Jacques </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Maple Treeway lap</font> time of 0'44\"351 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'44\"295</font><br><font color=yellow>Tyler Reyes </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Mario Circuit 3 crs</font> time of 1'18\"369 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'18\"322</font><br><font color=yellow>Alvin van Asselt </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square lap</font> time of 0'39\"107 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"997</font><br><br>This concludes the activity of MKW this week. From unexpected returns to leapfrogging players of terror, it was a pretty eventful Thanksgiving week, to say the least. See you guys in 2 weeks for my next news update.</b><br></p>",

The only thing is, not a lot of people played that had full timesheets near the top, so if you are a low-ranked player, this is your lucky day since you'll probably get mentioned if you PRed! Celebrate! Anyway, while they're celebrating, let's check out the week's movement.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Two newbies to the site this week.<br><font color=lime>Majdan Doucin</font> submitted 32 times, which are of course any time excluding flaps (what is it with this game and ignoring flaps?) The times slot in theoretically at 246th, which isn't bad for a start, and as always flaps improve AF. Hopefully Majdan will defy the odds and submit flaps soon.<br><font color=lime>Ruben Dario</font> had a slightly better showing than Majdan, but submitted the same 32 times. *yawn* Ruben's times are currently 174th, which is a very good start for a new player, but will the others follow? We'll have to wait and see.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movers and Losers</font><br><br>Well honestly it probably doesn’t help people want to kart if you’re called losers, or maybe your motivated by insults, so sorry, and you’re welcome respectively. This week 28 karters played, which ties the record for the most playing in one week since Nick and I have begun switching off. There’s your random statistic for the news update. Oh, and for a little change I decided to throw in the average AF that you lose in each group, so you know how much you need to cut to stay even. (NOTE : This doesn't include those annoying New Players that join to push you down a spot when you stay exactly where you are. Curse them.)<br><br><br><br><font color=yellow>~~The Top 10~~ (or, \"Wow, someone besides Nick Meade or Alex Shoal is playing this week?\") [Average Loss : .1000 - .2000 AF]</font><br>Only one karter was active this last week in the illustrious Top 10. <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> (or Andrew Watson, I'm still not really sure) came back with four PRs to pass his nemesis Tyler McNell and move up a spot. <br><br><font color=yellow>~~11-25~~ (or, \"The Graveyard of Kartless Horror\") [Average Loss : .3000 - .4500 AF]</font><br>As with it's name, no one played. That makes these few sentences really boring to read. Sorry about that. Don't blame me, I just write the news.<br><br><font color=yellow>~~26-50~~ (or, \"Wow, we're never usually this quiet\") [Average Loss : .6500 - .8000 AF] </font><br>Four players were active here, which would be kind of weak except for the fact that no one above them played (except Jimmy). So I guess these guys deserve some credit even though they slacked off as well. <font color=yellow>#28 Salvatore Bellusci</font> is setting the standard by moving up a place, putting him only three spots away from joining the graveyard, which I wouldn't necessarily want to do. He hit 16 PRs and cut about 8% AF, which is really good for a one place move. <font color=yellow>#30 Oliver Martin</font> PRed twice, but dropped AF and stayed in the same spot. Oh well, at least he didn't lose any spots. <font color=yellow>#39 Gavin Price</font> hit two PRs, I'm not sure if they were with the Wheel or not but if they were that's pretty impressive. He cut .04 AF, which isn't that great but it's better than the other 330-something people that decided not to play. Finally,  <font color=yellow>#42 Jay Batten</font> has been on a tear in the past few weeks, this time notching 10 new PRs and moving up four spots. At this rate he should join Salvatore in the graveyard in a few months. <br><br><font color=yellow>~~51-100~~ (or, “Go Danny Gallenberger!”) [Average Loss : .8000 - 1.0000 AF]</font><br>The first up in this group to pick up a GCN(well, most likely) is <font color=yellow>#72 Ashley O’Hara</font>. Degausser PRed three times, most likely all on tracks involving the Spear. The PRs cut a little under 2 AF points and let Ashley begin bridging the gap to the next rank. Next up is <font color=yellow>#83 Emmanuel Amador</font>, who moved up one spot with 15 PRs, or .067 spots per PR. Sounds more depressing that way, doesn’t it?  <font color=yellow>#95 John Brunn</font> played a little as well, moving into the top 100 for the first time all the way from 110!. Congrats John for your great accomplishment, now don’t get lazy like the other 46 people among you and rise to the top! It’s a good thing John made a move into the Top 100, because otherwise <font color=yellow>#100 Danny Gallenberger</font> wouldn’t have had such an epic entry into the AF charts. Danny filled out his 64/64 timesheet and joined exactly at #100. Now I’m sure Danny would have liked to join at #99, but as a news updater it’s more exciting when you join right at the cutoff. Plus he got a title named after him, so there. The losers of the week (other than the guys that didn’t play) are ex-#99 Justin Best and ex-#100 Biago Macula, who are now part of the next paragraph below.<br><br><font color=yellow>~~101 and Beyond~~ (or, “Run away Christian Wild is attacking!”) [Average Loss : 1.1000 - 1.5000 AF]</font><br>Starting things off, <font color=yellow>#102 Christian Nemetz</font>, who moved up from #113 to sit just below the 100 group, waiting to strike on Danny. Run Danny, Run! Christian had 13 PRs and at this rate should enter the Top 100 by the time NMeade is sitting at his computer writing this next week. We next move down to <font color=yellow>#114 Dexter Howe</font>, who seems to be stuck in the 110s for all of eternity. Maybe it’s a curse or something, but hopefully Dexter will get out of it eventually, preferably upwards then downwards. <font color=yellow>#118 Noah Gordon</font> hit 2 PRs made a small cut to his AF. <font color=yellow>#123 Sam Smith</font> is now in the coolest position in the chart (that is until we get 1200+ players). He hit 3 PRs to move him up one to his numerically ordered spot. In his second week on the charts, <font color=yellow>#135 Dave Tandy</font> slowed down a lot from 64 new times last week with only five this week, yet still moved up two places. This impressive showing was followed by <font color=yellow>#137 Loris Bagnasco</font> hitting 5 PRs but moving down a place. Obviously the luck was with Dave this week. <font color=yellow>#143 Jamal Fluellen</font> breaks the 200 AF barrier with his PRs this week, and karts just enough to stay ahead of <font color=yellow>#144 Zack Weber</font>, who PRed 12 times to move up three spots. 141-144 are separated by less than an AF point, so Jamal and Zack should have some easy pickings to start off the next week. Finally, <font color=yellow>#146 Christian Wild</font> continues to destroy another kart game, and it is only time before he’s hitting GODs. This week he hit 28 PRs (no hoarding, ladies and gentlemen), and moved up from #155 to make it into the top 150. As for the rest of the people, they just watched their AF counts drop. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>One new site record this week, which beats my last update by one. NMeade gets all the fun. <br><font color=yellow>Aziz Abdullah </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 crs</font> time of 0'53\"283 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'53\"201</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br><br>Didn’t have as much time for awards these past two weeks, so the progress was slowed, but I got July and August 2010 done, which means the new awards will actually start to show up at the top of the Awards page for the new POWs. The 3rd POQ will be awarded soon. Also keep a lookout for the poll for POY 2010, which should be coming out in a week or two.<br><br>Anyway, the new POM’s and POQ’s from last week are below.<br><br><u>POM's</u><br>July 2010 - <font color=yellow>Dustin Enders</font><br>August 2010 - <font color=yellow>Gavin Price</font><br><br>Peace.<br><br>-Web<br></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Good evening, if you're reading this on this rainy night (at least where I am), get ready for a lot of action this past week. This is probably one of the most active weeks there has been in a while. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br><font color=lime>Fiorese Alberto, Myles Rodriguez, Andre Hoelscher, and Sean Owens</font> hopped on the MKW train this week.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Getting to actual movement, this week, 37 players were active this week, so this update will probably take a while, oh well.<br><br>The Top 10 this week decided to play dangerous and have two people instead of one person last week play. Starting, off, <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade</font> makes 4 decent PRs at the end of the week to regain lost ground from several inactive weeks, returning to the 5 AF range, escaping the wrath of the 6 AF range, boy is that scary. Since no one after Nick decided they wanted to play, German Champ <font color=yellow>#10 Mark Schmidt</font> decided to pick up the slack, making 2 PRs, and enters the sacred land of the Top 10, passing up James Richards, nice job Mark. Hopefully Mark's activity will scare the people around him to play this week.<br><br>It didn't look all that much different going from #11 to #25 this week, with this area mimicking the Top 10, with two players active. Staring off, <font color=yellow>#16 Cole Gilbert</font> improved his own WR on rPB this week and gains no places, I guess he got bored of playing for AF so he improved his own WR to spur some activity. A little farther back, <font color=yellow>#23 Lucas Acek</font> makes a really nice 10 PR string to rise himself two places, 3 places now separate him from the Top 20.<br><br>How ironic, like my last update, a lot of activity starts from the #26 to #50 range. Very eager to jump into the paragraph above me we get to <font color=yellow>#27 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who, like Lucas, made another nice PR string of 7 PRs to push himself another spot closer to being mentioned in the Top 25 activity paragraph and closer to Top 20 as well. Not too far behind, <font color=yellow>#30 Oliver Martin</font> makes a solid 2 PRs and strengthens his #30 spot, getting a tiny bit closer to #29 Jason Smith. Putting immense pressure on Oliver, probably the most active person this week, <font color=yellow>#31 Zane Royal</font> turns into a monster, nearly PRing half his sheet to jump all the way from #48 to #31, that's quite the impressive jump, especially in these ranks, great job. Right behind Zane is one of our new players this week, <font color=yellow>#31 Fiorese Alberto</font> joins directly at #31, becomes the new Italian Champ, and is less than .1 AF from Zane, I can feel the room heating up already. A few places on <font color=yellow>#38 Gavin Price</font> decides to join the \"I'm gonna make 2 PRs this week\" trend and does just that, securing his #38 spot. Barely a few places back, <font color=yellow>#42 Jay Batten</font> makes a great deal of PRs, making 7 new times and is now less than 1 AF from #41 Andy Lundeen. Lastly, we come to another ridiculously insane cut this week from <font color=yellow>#50 Franco Gubser</font>. Like Zane, Franco decided to PR over half of his time sheet, and cut 13 overall places, going from #63 into the famous Top 50 category, nice job.<br><br>Straying away from Top 50 territory, we come to the most active section of MKW this week. With no fear, <font color=yellow>#52 Simone Bertini</font> destroys 21 PRs and jumps from #68 to #52. These huge jumps are making me lose my mind, you just have to think of these guys as playing leap frog, but jumping over a dozen people with ease, pretty crazy if you ask me. <font color=yellow>#55 Ross Coleman</font> is the first victim of the deathly leap frogger, but stands his ground, setting 4 PRs this week to stay in place at #55. The second victim of the deadly Simone is <font color=yellow>#62 Sebastian Wimmer</font>, who makes a good 3 PRs to stay in good standing to come back next week. Defying all the logic of leap frogging, <font color=yellow>#65 Agustin Berrios</font> decides that he doesn't exactly want to be pushed back from Simone, so he set 8 PRs this week to jump 1 place to #65, you're one hell of a fighter, Agustin. Just a few places away, <font color=yellow>#68 Sofie Wimmer</font> assumes the place of Simone, and like Agustin, makes a strong 8 PRs to push 1 place forward to #68. Moving on, <font color=yellow>#74 Emmanuel Amador</font> liked the trend Oliver and Gavin started, so he too strengthened his current spot and made 3 PRs this week. I guess that trend is like a disease this week, because <font color=yellow>#78 Jon Coppernoll</font> did the same thing, but made 5 PRs this week, including some impressive Legend times, great job. Finally breaking the trend, <font color=yellow>#87 John Brunn</font> makes a nice 9 PR string, passing 5 players to #87, and made his first Legend time, nice going. 7 places back, <font color=yellow>#94 Michael Schneider</font> goes 1 more PR than John, making 10 PRs and sweeping past 3 players this week. Returning to MKW this week, <font color=yellow>#98 Alex Vandegrift</font> makes a solid 6 PRs and slots up 1 place better to end off the week. Finishing off this section is <font color=yellow>#100 Christian Nemetz</font>, who finally joins the wonderful land of the Top 100, making 8 PRs and jumping that 1 place he needed to achieve Top 100, nice job.<br><br>Out of the Top 100 we arrive at the 7 last active players of this week. Kicking us off is <font color=yellow>#114 Dexter Howe</font>, who makes 6 PRs and gets very close to taking over #113 Martin Prigent. Just 5 places back we were nicely greeted by another one of the new players this week, <font color=yellow>#119 Andre Hoelscher</font> joins directly at #119 this week, very very close to the Top 100. A little farther back comes two very active players in the Top 140 area this week. <font color=yellow>#131 Dave Tandy</font> made 10 fresh PRs this week to cut himself 4 overall places, and <font color=yellow>#134 Loris Bagnasco</font> does the same deal of PRs, and cuts two overall places this week. 8 places back, <font color=yellow>#142 Zack Weber</font> makes a 6 PR string to secure his #142nd spot as he comes a little closer to Top 100. Laying off the steam a little this week, <font color=yellow>#144 Christian Wild</font> set 2 PRs that jumped him 2 overall places to #144, how ironic right? The last active player of this week is <font color=yellow>#296 Daniel Sampson</font>, who made 1 PR this week even though he fell back 1 place.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'13\"261 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'13\"239</font><br><br>Honorable mention goes to Christian Wild this week who picked up his first German Record, nice job Christian.<br><br>As this update comes to a close, I see this update took a little over an hour, and now I'm a little sleepy, a little hungry, but more sleepy than hungry, but you don't really need to know that though. The increased activity this week tells me that everyone is working harder to move up as much as they can before 2010 is in the books. Assuming that a good deal of people began their holidays already, and many more are going to start them within a week or so (myself included) I hope you enjoy your time off. Until next time :)</b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, it’s Web here with another news update.<br>This month everyone decided that it was a long time coming, and pretty much everyone who hasn’t smashed their MKW disc by now decided to pick up the game and play. Late December always brings the late PR rushes, and this week didn’t disappoint. (Well, unless you’re me, since I have to write a lot more now)<br><br>On a sounding serious but not really serious at all note, before I start I’d like to say that I lied last week about it being the most active week since we started switching off with updates. There was a NMeade update that had more people active, and last week was more active too, so now it’s the third most active update, not counting this one. You still with me? Good.  Random statistic for the week is a lie. Whatever, I’m surprised nobody commented on that but I figured I’d just point that out. As for activity this week, well you’ll just have to keep reading to find out!<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br><br>Three noobs this week, all deciding to join because it was snowing outside and there’s nothing better to do when it’s snowing then play MKW. <br><br><font color=lime>Fernando Cristaldi </font> submitted 32 times, which you know so I’m not going to say which. The times are about 238th in AF, and probably would be better in the 3lap AF chart. I’m not holding out any hope for Fernando to submit his flaps, since no one ever does.<br><br><font color=lime>Luke Allen</font> submitted 37 times, which probably means he picked his five favorite courses for flaps, or he realized that you can only see the flaps right after you finish a run on the last five courses. Either way, he’s 279th, which isn’t bad for missing out on the other great 27 flaps.<br><br><font color=lime>Jeff Hensel </font> submitted the 32 times, and is a little lower at 337th. I’m sure all three of these guys could destroy a lot of AF points if they submitted flaps. It’s pretty tempting, come on you know you want to.<br><br><font color=cyan>The Weekly Movement Report</font><br><br>I figured that sounded more official than normal, and a lot better than “Movers and Losers”, so hopefully you like it to. This week 45 karters were active, which is actually the most in one week since we started doing the updates switching off. So yeah, I have some fun ahead of me. This week I’m going to go back to the norm, as a lot more people were active than normal. Expect an interesting and fun 2011 update though.<br><br>Also, a big “welcome to the chart” for <font color=yellow>#33 Alberto Fiorese</font>, who finally finished his timesheet and joined the charts with 25 PRs (not sure how many were times he hadn’t submitted), annoying every player on the charts but 32 (the guys ahead of him). Surprisingly he made it out of the lower section of people without full timesheets that I don’t mention, which never normally happens. Maybe he’ll spur on others, but probably not.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br><br>At the top, <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson </font> returns to karting action this week. He was the highest active player, and hit 5 PRs to keep his position. He’s still a good 9 AF points away from the Top 5 and Shaun Tanney though, so he’ll have to keep karting. The story this week in the top group is <font color=yellow>#10 Dustin Enders</font>, who after months and months of karting finally makes his way into the Top 10. Dustin hit 16 PRs to make an 8% cut, and bump Mark Schmidt out of this illustrious group.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#11 Mark Schmidt</font> definitely sensed the move by Dustin, but it wasn’t enough to stop him. Mark played enough to hit 1 PR, but still ended up losing AF. Not a lot of activity at the top though, so if Mark keeps playing eventually the others will fall to his grasp. Next is <font color=yellow>#16 Cole Gilbert</font>, who submitted two PRs this week (one of which was a new Site Record), and cut a small amount of AF. Cole will probably come back in a few months with 16 new Site Records that he got that day, so if he’s inactive for now, you know why. A little lower is <font color=yellow>#21 Marvin Rekovsky</font>, who moved up three spots from #24 with his 12 PRs to secure his spot in this group. Someone trying to secure their spot in the group is <font color=yellow>#25 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who jumped up two spots with 13 PRs of his own. Joe Sebeny is the unlucky karter to be displaced from the group this week. Other than that, this group is relatively quiet as well, with the same faces playing week to week.<br> <br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><br>Here’s where a good portion of the activity happened this week, which is always where a good portion of the activity happens. <font color=yellow>#30 Oliver Martin</font> knocked out 3 PRs to hold his ground, and it’s a good thing he played, because if he hadn’t, he would have been overcome by <font color=yellow>#31 Jay Batten</font>. Jay was on fire this week, moving from #42 up 11 spots. This came with only 12 PRs, and caused a 13% and 9 point AF cut. Very nice, and probably POW material once I get around to it. Right below is <font color=yellow>#32 Zane Royal</font>, who dropped 1.2 points of AF but was taken over by Jay’s impressive move. If Zane tries to stick with Jay, he’ll be in the top before long. After Alberto’s entry at #33, successfully moving everyone below him down a spot that they had to make up, <font color=yellow>#46 Hendrik Boss</font> hit three new PRs to jump up a spot, or two spots if you forget Alberto’s existence. Following him is <font color=yellow>#48 Franco Gubser</font>, who secured his spot in the Top 50 by moving up two spots with 6 nice PRs. These caused a 4.7 AF cut, which shows how spread out this group really is.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><br>In the next group, there was activity but it was really spread out for the amount of players (50, if you’re not good at math), in the group. First up is <font color=yellow>#59 Matthieu Mayer</font>, who hit one PR and only cut a tenth of a point of AF. It’s better than nothing though, as everyone falls around you. Right behind him is <font color=yellow>#60 Nate Paternost</font>, who made a nice six place move with 16 PRs. Matthieu better watch his back. <font color=yellow>#67 Sofie Wimmer</font>, #2 on the female list hit 2 PRs two move up two spots, the perfect example of efficiency. Next up is <font color=yellow>#77 Jon Coppernol</font>, or “Mr. Legend” (since that’s all he seems to PR with these days). Jon hit 5 PRs to move up a spot, not sure if they were all Legends or not. <font color=yellow>#84 Sophie Steiner</font>, #3 on the female AF chart, hit 6 PRs to keep her ground. I think MKW beats all the other karts with the most females in the Top 100, or maybe just the most females with timesheets period. <font color=yellow>#86 John Brunn</font>, hit 4 PRs which bumped him up one spot. (Or two spots, if we’re still talking about Alberto again). A little lower down is <font color=yellow>#88 Michael Schneider</font>, who put his mark on the Top 100 and ensured his place in the group by jumping from #94. That’s good for him because in the past few weeks there has been a plethora of activity from the #90 to the #110 range, as everyone is scrambling to reach this illustrious rank. <font color=yellow>#94 Alex Vandegrift</font> took the abandoned room for this own, jumping up four spots to escape his pursuers with 3 PRs and a 3.6 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#99 Christian Nemetz</font>, who recently entered this group kept up his progress, with a one spot jump with four PRs. That leaves Bastian Brinkmann on the bubble position, maybe he’ll sense the danger better than Mark Schmidt and defend his rank.<br><br><font color=red>~~101 and Onwards~~</font><br><br>Sadly, I have to start this off with <font color=yellow>#101 Danny Gallenberger</font>, who despite using the Wheel for his PRs he could not fight back up into the Top 100. He still made a one spot improvement from his two place drop last week, hitting four PRs and losing 2.5 points of AF. Fight for it Danny! I believe in you!  A little farther down is “King of the 110s” <font color=yellow>#113 Dexter Howe</font>, who has been in this range since the beginning of time. He hit two nice PRs that paid off and lost him 2.4 points of AF, moving him one spot closer to the 100-109 range.  Next up is <font color=yellow>#118 Liam Lynch</font>, who jumped up three spots from #121 with a massive 16 PRs. This made him lose 9 points of AF, but due to the spread out nature of the AF counts in this group he didn’t move up much place-wise.  <font color=yellow>#121 Noah Gordon</font>, four PRs lost him some AF but it also lost him a place, he fell from #120 due to Liam’s great move.  A little further behind is <font color=yellow>#123 Dave Tandy</font>, who shot like a cannon from #131st with 13 great PRs. 3% of AF also was dropped in the process, and Noah better watch his back for another massive move next week.  <font color=yellow>#132 Loris Bagnasco</font> was the next to play, hurdling two unlucky karters with a fun 6 PR spree. It’s a good thing he did, because right behind him was <font color=yellow>#133 Jamal Fluellen</font>, jumping all the way from 147th with a massive cut. Jamal hit 26 PRs and knocked off 17 whole points of AF, very impressive and if he keeps up progress like that he should be up near the Top 100 in no time. A little lower down is <font color=yellow>#140 Zack Weber</font> moving up two spots with 8 PRs, and a decent 4.4 AF cut. This whole group is very compressed, so if someone picked up their controller and had a nice week they could gain a great amount of positions. Slightly lower is <font color=yellow>#146 Christian Wild</font> only hit one PR, which hasn’t enough to stop him from dropping two spots in AF due to the jump from Jamal and the entrance of everyone’s favorite karter this week, Alberto.  Much lower down <font color=yellow>#228 Dave Johnston</font> hit 17 PRs, and jumped up four spots on the AF chart. He had a 7.8 AF cut here as well which is nice, but doesn’t get you as much as a higher spot. Hopefully Dave is reading this and can use it as encouragement. <font color=yellow>#255 Tony Fan</font> hit one PR which bumped him up two spots as well, so it must have been a pretty good PR. Next up is <font color=yellow>#290 Andrew Howes</font>, who notched up 2 PRs and cut a small amount of AF, which was better than anyone near him who all dropped. All you have to do is cut a little AF per week and slowly you’ll move up in positions. Finally <font color=yellow>#336 Quassim Weber</font> hit 15 PRs to jump up two spots. This involved a 3.6 AF point cut. Just keep studying strats and tightening your turns and you should reach the Top 300 in no time!<br>Well that’s the week’s movement. Phew, I’m tired. I think I’m going to take a nap before I write the rest of this.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>Okay, I’m awake now. Site records this week were really exciting, much more exciting than normal. We had a random comeback from a legend (oh wait that’s all he does), and two strat changes on courses two years after release. The Spear finally prevailed over the Magikruiser on rSGB, and the Spear lost another course to the Flame Runner on rDH. <br><br>On the “most records” table, Rom extends his dominant lead over the field with 9 SRs now, and here’s your random statistic for the update : strength of the WRs was improved by a whole .007661%! That’s insane (I think)<br><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'13\"239 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'13\"188</font><br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach crs</font> time of 1'22\"472 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'22\"238</font><br><font color=yellow>Aziz Abdullah </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills crs</font> time of 1'35\"466 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'35\"432</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br><br>I knocked out another two months this week, which gets us up to the end of October 2010 (yeah, that’s a current date). So basically I’m only a month and 19 days behind with the awards, and that can easily be caught up to by the next time I write to you (which will be the new year by the way). If you weren’t aware, in the next few days a poll will be going up for the POY 2010 (I’ve received quite a few nominations), so vote to see which karter you think had the best 365 days. Stay tuned for a 4th POQ poll as well, that might be coming up soon.<br><br>Anyway, after my fun ramblefest the two new POM’s are below.

        "content": "<p><b>Sorry for this update being on Monday instead of Sunday, last night a pretty bad blizzard hit where I am, knocking out my net, phone, tv, etc. Blizzards can pack a pretty hard punch now from what I can see, don't underestimate them. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br><font color=lime>Peter Lustig</font> was the only new player this week.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Not comparable to last weeks 45 player week activity, this week still had a strong and healthy 39 people playing kart this week, so let's start off with the Top 10.<br><br>Three people were active in this area this week, starting off with <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade</font>, Nick made 3 PRs, two of which were WRs and another 3lap improvement, helped him out to stay within the 5 AF range this week with others improving. Continuing his recent comeback, <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> made 4 PRs this week to take advantage of #7 Tyler McNell's inactivity. He still has a huge leap to #5 Shaun Tanney but it doesn't take long for things to change in this game. Coming considerably close now, <font color=yellow>#8 Mark Schmidt</font> raced 6 new PRs and got within less than 1 AF of #7 Tyler McNell now, and reclaimed the German Champ status from Dustin Enders as well. A new rivalry might happen between Mark and Jimmy by the looks of it if they keep PRing.<br> <br>#11->#25 picked up some good activity this week as well. Kicking us off is <font color=yellow>#14 Mickael Smolen</font>, who returns this week with 1 PR to get some activity in before 2010 closes. Right behind him, <font color=yellow>#15 Cole Gilbert</font> improves his own rPB 3lap WR again, which cuts himself no places (like last time) but ended up moving up from #16 to #15 this week because of activity around him, if only that worked for everybody. Making nice progress not too far behind Cole is <font color=yellow>#18 Tony Ruiz</font> who sets a good 9 PR string to cut a nice deal of AF, getting closer to #17 Daniel Anderson. Keeping the pressure on Tony is the new Top 20 member <font color=yellow>#19 Marvin Rekovsky</font>, who made 8 PRs cutting 3 overall places, 3 AF points, and enters the Top 20, nice progress! 2 places behind, <font color=yellow>#21 Alvin Le</font> followed Mickael this week with only 1 PR, but cuts a solid few places with it to stay within .2 AF of #20 Leif Leopold. I guess this week was the week of returns, because <font color=yellow>#22 Robert van Zanten</font> decided to come back too with a good chunk of 4 PRs to move himself from #23 to #22. Still jumping with a great deal of PRs like these past few weeks, <font color=yellow>#24 Salvatore Bellusci</font> makes a great 13 PRs this week and moves from #25 to #24, coming really close to #23 Brendan Payne. <br><br>I'm surprised, normally the #26->#50 section would be full of activity, but is one of the lowest groups of activity this week with 4 people active. Coming close to the Top 25, <font color=yellow>#29 Jay Batten</font> notches 1 spot better this week from #30 to #29 with 4 PRs and cuts a little over 2 AF. Right behind him barely an AF away is new Top 30 member <font color=yellow>#30 Zane Royal</font>. Zane took advantage of some of the inactivity and sends in 7 PRs to place himself at #30 from #32. Trying not to lose too much ground, <font color=yellow>#32 Oliver Martin</font> got knocked back 1 place this week but sent in 1 PR that cut half an AF to keep good standing of 1 AF behind #31 Jason Smith. Closing out this section, new Top 50 member <font color=yellow>#49 Ross Coleman</font> makes a big 15 PRs and makes a mighty leap from #57 to #49 to close out the week.<br><br>Continuing the trend of comebacks, <font color=yellow>#58 Stacy Needham</font> came back this week with a solid 6 PRs and bumped himself 1 spot closer to entering the Top 50. Only 2 places back, <font color=yellow>#60 Agustin Berrios</font> made a big 14 PR string to jump from #62 to #60 and being pretty close to jump over some other people with some more work. 6 places back, <font color=yellow>#66 Sofie Wimmer</font> made 4 PRs to push up 1 place from #67 to #66. 5 places back, the next come-back-er (yeah probably isn't the right term to use XD) is <font color=yellow>#71 Ashely O'Hara</font>. Ashley made 3 PR cuts and cut exactly 1.5 AF to notch himself up 1 more place this week. Keeping up activity, <font color=yellow>#85 John Brunn</font> made 3 PRs and a nice 2 AF cut to rise from #86 to #85. Following another popular trend of jumping 1 place, <font color=yellow>#93 Alex Vandegrift</font> played this week and made 4 PRs, rose 1 place and cut a little over 1 AF. Finishing up this area of activity, a new face to the Top 100 is <font color=yellow>#98 Danny Gallenberger</font> who made 4 PRs of his own and jumped from #101 to #98, nice job.<br><br>To #101 and beyond the last 6 active players of this week were here. Making the biggest cut of anyone this week, <font color=yellow>#115 Fredrick Hutchington</font> makes a humongous 37 PRs, cut over 25 AF, and made a 19 place cut from #134 all the way to #115, impressive stuff Fredrick. Making another huge leap too is <font color=yellow>#122 Loris Bagnasco</font> who made a good 14 PRs and cut 10 places along with 11 AF cut, great work. Trying not to be knocked back too far this week but still active is <font color=yellow>#124 Dave Tandy</font> and <font color=yellow>#126 Sam Smith</font>, who made 2 PRs and 1 PR respectively and both were knocked back by Loris and Fredrick. <font color=yellow>#138 Zack Weber</font> joined in on the 1 place jump trend too, making 4 PRs and moving from #139 to #138 this week. Finishing off the weeks activity, <font color=yellow>#335 Quassim Weber</font> made 7 fresh PRs where he too joined the 1 place jump trend and moved from #336 to #335. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>Good Site Record activity took place this week with 6 new Site Records being set.<br><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time of 2'17\"935 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'17\"683</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Raftery </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano lap</font> time of 0'04\"524 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04\"397</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'13\"188 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'13\"172</font><br><font color=yellow>Aziz Abdullah </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 crs</font> time of 0'53\"165 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'53\"145</font><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium crs</font> time of 1'51\"187 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'51\"184</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Bowser's Castle lap</font> time of 0'48\"821 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'48\"720</font><br><br>This is probably the last update of 2010 for this kart game, so cheers to everyone who made progress this whole year and to make 2011 even better and enjoy your holidays.</b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>What’s up MKW community, may I be the last to say : Happy New Year! 2010 was a great year for MKW, we saw the rise of a new champion and new emerging stars. <br><br>If you haven’t been on the forums recently, or checked the AF chart, we’re happy to announce that Jorge Hernandez (KTMario), has dropped his frozen status and ascended to the ranks of legitimacy. He streamed yesterday and set some pretty sick times, and plans to stream in the future. So for everyone holding out hope for him, it’s finally been realized. Expect exciting activity at the top now that the crown has changed hands.<br><br>Other than that, it’s 2011, which means the third year of MKW competition has drawn to a close, and another is beginning. Each year we’ve had a single dominant player at the top that easily cruised to the POY award, but maybe 2011 will be different. We can only wait to find out, as 364 days remain for movement to happen! Let’s get on to the week’s activity and other stuff. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br><br>Two new players joined this week, both very familiar faces on the forum but finally getting their sets of times up. The big surprise is that both had a full timesheet, which never happens. So congrats to both of you and may you move up in the weeks to come.<br><br><font color=lime>Brett Edwards </font>, a.k.a “Mr. 1:59.945” (or .824 on Feb 17th, 2011) decided to join the page with a full timesheet after TTing for a couple years. With him he brought three SRs and fourth a top ten time. He had an unbalanced timesheet when first submitted so slotted in at #165, but quickly worked his way up the charts throughout the week and finished at #128.<br><br><font color=lime>Timur Ahmad</font> a.k.a “Zwiebel”, joined near the bottom at #252 but still had all 64 times submitted, which is an improvement in itself. Timur has had great success in MKDS where he’s currently #4, and in MKDD where he’s shooting for the Top 100, so I would expect him to move up greatly if he keeps up with the activity. <br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br><br>Since last time, 40 players were active. Not as many as that ridiculous 45 week but still a lot. This is most likely because people were busy enjoying the holidays instead of karting, but still an impressive week overall for MKW. Get ready for a long update because some people were really busy. <br><br>“A welcome to the AF chart” goes out to <font color=yellow>#125 Marvin Donjes</font>, who was on a tear this week. He took a SR at Mushroom Gorge of ridiculous proportions, which if confirmed as legitimate would just blow the underestimated MG GOD out of the water. He also hit 8 PRs and cut something like 28 AF. <br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br><br>Obviously I have to start this off with a huge congratulations to newly christened <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez </font>, who submitted the 29 PRs he’s gotten since he was last frozen and passed longtime champ Nick for the site crown. This ends Nick’s reign four days before he was about to take the record for most days overall from Bubbles (Dave has 324, Nick has 320). Jorge’s AF dropped from 7.7 to 5.2, a massive 32% cut. Even though all of the times weren’t raced in the week all are still very impressive. Jorge also has 5 GODs now, most of any karter. <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> (it feels really weird to type that) was also active, and even though he dropped from 5.8 to 6.0 AF he still found time to hit two PRs and keep the lead at a reachable distance, standing at .8 AF currently. <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> continued his recent streak of activity and hit 7 PRs in 7 days. The cut was of .6 AF and brought Jimmy inching closer to #5 Shaun Tanney. Jimmy is only 7.5 points away, and if he keeps playing as he has been recently he might reach the top 5, as far away as it seems. The rest of the Top 10 were quiet or too busy discovering new strats on Mario Circuit. <br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Arthur Bauer</font> made a 74% AF cut of 108 points, and hit 63 PRs, going from #95 to #12. It’s pretty obvious he hoarded so he won’t be winning any POW awards, but the move places him within striking distance of Ben Hart and the Top 10. Next up is <font color=yellow>#14 Tony Ruiz</font>, who grabbed 11 PRs and jumped from #18, a great move for being this high up. Tony also held on to his rWS Site Record and brought it down further so that’s an added bonus. <font color=yellow>#18 Cole Gilbert</font> submitted another PR, and another rPB World Record improvement. He’s becoming a beast at that course much like he’s been on others in the past, and it’s going to take a lot for someone to take it away. Two more players were active at the bottom of this group, trying to survive so they don’t drop out of the Top 25. <font color=yellow>#22 Alvin Le</font> PRed once and avoided losing as much AF as the inactives around him. <font color=yellow>#23 Salvatore Bellusci</font> grabbed 6 PRs, and although he lost AF he didn’t lose as much as #24 Robert van Zanten and #25 Brendan Payne so he passed them both. Still relatively quiet at this group though, the activity begins lower down.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><br>The always-active <font color=yellow>#29 Jay Batten</font> was active, and hit 9 PRs. He cut 4 points of AF but didn’t move up any spots. He would have bumped down to #30 due to Arthur’s massive cut, but he passed Jamie Disley so stayed in place. <font color=yellow>#31 Oliver Martin</font> had a 7 PR spree where he cut almost three AF points and jumped up a place. <font color=yellow>#32 Zane Royal</font>, recent December POM winner and runner up for the POQ probably had the most annoying week of all. Not only did he just lose out on the POQ award, but he cut points off of his AF but dropped two places due to Arthur and Oli. At least with the AF cut he distanced himself from people behind. Much farther down <font color=yellow>#43 Harp Valentine</font> notched 4 PRs and cut a little under an AF point. He was followed closely by the 52nd winner of a POW in 2010, <font color=yellow>#45 Ross Coleman</font>, who secured his place in this group by jumping from #49 with a 4 nice PRs. <br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><br>Starting out this group we have somebody looking longingly at Bob Holden who is currently chilling in the #50 position. <font color=yellow>#52 Yannick Wiesner</font> hit 30 PRs, possibly hoarding possibly not, and jumped 10 overall places to sit waiting to pounce. Current MKSC POY candidate <font color=yellow>#60 Stacy Needham</font> grabbed 3 PRs but dropped two spots. Thus are the trials of MKW’s low activity policy. If you don't play enough, you feel the consequences. Another weird Zane-like move happened to <font color=yellow>#62 Agustin Berrios</font>, who cut AF but dropped two spots from #60. It just shows how close together the players are in this area, and how just inactivity can switch around the ranks. <font color=yellow>#64 Sofie Wimmer</font>(and #2 Female) hit 4 PRs and jumped two spots from #66, and had a 3.1 AF cut, which is a 3.0% cut at her level. <font color=yellow>#71 Ashley O’Hara</font> stayed at #71 with 3 PRs and hopefully he can move up a little more in the future, or at least continue to cut AF. <font color=yellow>#75 Emmanuel Amador</font> snatched a PR and cut some AF, but dropped a spot (he would have stayed if not for Arthur, like many). <font color=yellow>#76 Thibaud Bordeau</font> had a nice 14 PR week, and moved from #83 up 7 spots.  <font color=yellow>#96 Danny Gallenberger</font>, who is my new favorite karter for whatever reason, continued his surge into the Top 100 with exactly a 1.000 AF cut (or improving 64 places across all charts), and moved up two places. He’s followed behind by <font color=yellow>#97  Martin Prigent</font>, who jumps from #114 with a 27 PR week, all the time wondering which drifts are which. Christian Nemetz, still upset at his loss in the POQ poll dropped out of this group and will have to fight back into it.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-358~~</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#113 Dexter Howe</font> is the first to be active in this group with one PR. If he wants to get out of the 110-119 range he should step it up a little to get out. At least he didn’t drop as much as the people behind him. <font color=yellow>#117 Dave Tandy</font> jumped from #124 with 27 PRs, and with an 8.1% AF cut. With his recent progress the Top 100 shouldn’t be that much out of reach. <font color=yellow>#120 Noah Gordon</font> was next to play lower down, and hit 11 PRs and jumped up 3 spots. Not sure if any of them were glitches or not. <font color=yellow>#123 Loris Bagnasco</font> took Cutz’s vacant spot with a 9 PR move. It cut some AF off, but still caused Loris to drop a place. <font color=yellow>#126 Sam Smith</font> cuts 1.4 AF and finds himself in between Marvin and Brett, two newcomers to the AF chart and two guys who can make progress in the future. Maybe he’ll try to stick with them as they move up the charts. <font color=yellow>#136 Zack Weber</font> jumps up two spots from his #138 last week, although he was bumped down by Brett and Marvin. The 4.7 point AF cut was nice with 12 PRs, and he’s only 5 AF points away from #128, so this group is very closely packed. Much farther down, <font color=yellow>#228 Dave Johnston</font> hit 9 PRs and dropped 4 points off his AF, but due to the joining of people onto the AF chart he stayed in his current position, where he would have been 226. At least he held his ground. <font color=yellow>#258 Tony Fan</font> had  a PR but it didn’t help him much since you have to PR a lot to move in the lower ranks. Finally recent newcomer <font color=yellow>#294 Jeff Hensel</font> pushed further away from the top 300 with a four place cut highlighted by 13 sweet PRs. Just focus on MT release and tightness, along with reading the strats and you’ll improve greatly!<br><br>Took longer than I thought it would, and I still have two fun sections to go. But I have a plate of chocolate-chip cookies right next to me and I’ve been eating them throughout, so this update isn’t that bad. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>A great amount of Site Records this week, a very impressive week for MKW as people wanted to close out the year (or begin it) with some nice new world-class PRs. I mean the strength of the SRs improved by a whole 0.103365%, even though I’m not really sure what that means.<br><br>Many new records were set by newly-validated Jorge Hernandez, and this caused him to just barely jump over Romain Smadja for the most SR crown. JG has 9 SRs from his previous 5 and ROM dropped one from his 9 to finish at 8. ROM has always hung on to this crown despite only having 44/64 records submitted, so maybe he’ll get some more if he finishes his timesheet. Expect this battle to be interesting though. <br><br><font color=yellow>Marvin Donjes </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'10\"145 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"412</font><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'51\"168 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'51\"122</font><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 0'35\"703 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"095</font><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Daisy Circuit crs</font> time of 1'29\"891 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'29\"819</font><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> time of 2'20\"785 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'20\"374</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Raftery </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano lap</font> time of 0'04\"397 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04\"079</font><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> time of 1'49\"146 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"004</font><br><font color=yellow>Brett Edwards </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moonview Highway crs</font> time of 1'43\"752 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'43\"687</font><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'12\"032 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'11\"295</font><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> time of 0'48\"003 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'48\"000</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'13\"172 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'13\"124</font><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land crs</font> time of 2'04\"797 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'04\"369</font><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium crs</font> time of 1'51\"184 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'51\"070</font><br><font color=yellow>Brett Edwards </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens crs</font> time of 2'00\"339 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'59\"824</font><br><font color=yellow>Brett Edwards </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens lap</font> time of 0'38\"632 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"573</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br><br>Every award up to now is finally done once a poll on the forum concludes.

NMeade stormed to the first award but now he’s being challenged by Jorge to see the true POY for 2010.

        "content": "<p><b>Hello everyone and good evening, I hope everyone is well. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Four new people joined the AF ranks this week; <font color=lime>Courtney Baker, Cameron Terrell, Josh Benson, and Tomás Pallaruelo</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Keeping the consistency of the past few weeks, 39 players picked up their controllers and time trialed this week.<br><br>Starting off in the Top 10, we probably had the most activity we've had in easily months. Wasting no time, directly at the top, <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font> continues to try to increase the spread between Nick and made two PRs but only gained one placement. Still edging a little bit, <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> made two PRs as well and cut around the same as Jorge did, setting them exactly 1 AF point apart. A pleasant surprise, the French Champion <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font> returned to the scene this week. He made roughly 4 PRs on important courses (glitches) to rocket him over 1.5 AF to reach himself to a new time high of #3 and passed former World Champion <font color=yellow>#4 David McPartland</font>, congrats Marco. Still PRing, <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> makes 5 PRs and made close to a 1 AF cut edging closer to #5 Shaun Tanney. Very interesting activity happens from #8->#10 this week. To start off, <font color=yellow>#8 Mark Schmidt</font> comes back this week driving only 1 PR but cut nearly 1 AF, and is barely .2 AF from passing #7 Tyler McNell. Directly behind Mark, <font color=yellow>#9 Alex Shoal</font> makes 1 PR too to try and solidify his #9 place. It is enough for now, because one of the most active people this week, new Top 10 member <font color=yellow>Artur Bauer</font> made a great 16 PRs, cuts almost 4 AF, goes to #12->#10, and is maybe 2-4 placements from overtaking Alex for #9. If all the top players keep playing this week and for several weeks, for sure there will be some interesting battles going on to start off 2011.<br> <br>A good deal of activity continues into #11->#25 territory this week. <font color=yellow>#13 Ton Ruiz</font> made 9 PRs this week to boost himself one spot to #13 to slightly edge <font color=yellow>#14 Eric Hacksell</font>, who also played this week and drove 4 PRs to only lose one place instead of two, passing #15 James Richards. Getting very close to the Top 20, <font color=yellow>#21 Alvin Le</font> makes 3 PRs and comes pretty close to making #20. Only two places behind, <font color=yellow>#23 Salvatore Bellusci</font> drove 3 PRs as well this week, one of which is a fresh MG 3lap Site Record. Returning to the scene this week, <font color=yellow>#25 Jamie Disley</font> made a great 4 AF cut with 7 PRs to jump him to #25 this week.<br><br>I guess I'm starting to be pitted with slow activity in the #26-#50 area now where Zack has the fun of having more people active in this area during his week. Only two people were active this week here. <font color=yellow>#31 Oliver Martin</font> keeps activity alive with 2 PRs to cut close to 1 AF but is still around 2.5 AF away from Top 30. Adding to the people who returned this week, <font color=yellow>#33 Jason Smith</font> made 3 PRs and cut close to 1 AF like Oliver as well, creeping up on #32 Zane Royal.<br><br>#51->100 was the second most active area this week with 10 people active. Exactly at #51, <font color=yellow>#51 Yannick Wiesner</font> made 4 PRs and jumped a place to finish about 4 AF behind #50 this week. Continuing activity, <font color=yellow>#59 Stacy Needham</font> managed to PR 4 times too, cutting over 1.5 AF and jumping 3 places to enter the Top 60. Both <font color=yellow>#65 Sofie Wimmer and #66 Sebastian Wimmer</font> made two PRs this week but were both set back a place this week because of one very active person a little behind them. Just two places back, <font color=yellow>#68 Ashley O'Hara</font> made 4 PRs for a really nice 4.6 AF cut and jumped 3 places this week. Arriving at the most active person this week, <font color=yellow>#74 Alex Vandegrift</font> made a huge stab at his time sheet. Vandegrift PRd almost exactly half his time sheet, cutting him well over 30 AF and jumped him 21 places, really nice job Alex. Trying not to be set back too far after Alex's jump, <font color=yellow>#81 Jon Coppernoll</font> made 1 PR but was still set back 1 place this week. <font color=yellow>#88 John Brunn</font> continues his activity this week with 4 PRs, but was set back two placements this week. <font color=yellow>#93 Martin Prigent</font> managed to make 5 PRs and cut enough AF that he wasn't set back a place this week but jumped one placement at #93. Closing it out <font color=yellow>#98 Danny Gallenberger</font> made two PRs but ended up falling back one place.<br><br>Into the world of #101 and beyond was the most active section this week with 11 people active. Making 1 PR, <font color=yellow>#101 Christian Nemetz</font> cut .6 AF with his 1 PR and puts himself very close to the Top 100. Farther back, <font color=yellow>#114 Dexter Howe</font> fell back 1 place but still drove 1 PR to close the week out. Continuing progress, <font color=yellow>#116 Dave Tandy</font> made 4 PRs this week good for a 1.6 AF cut. Coming to the active quartet, <font color=yellow>#119 Brett Edwards</font> starts off his first week of being on the AF charts and made a good 13 PRs to cut over 8 AF and gain 5 ranks. Right behind Brett <font color=yellow>#120 Marvin Donjes</font> made 15 PRs who cut 8 AF too and gained 6 ranks this week. Behind Marvin, <font color=yellow>#121 Noah Gordon</font> made 3 PRs this week to cut over 2 AF but was set back a place. ... And behind HIM we have <font color=yellow>#122 Loris Bagnasco</font> cut almost 4 AF with 7 PRs and bumped up one placement. Two placements behind, the second most active person this week, <font color=yellow>#124 Sam Smith</font> made a big 25 PR streak, cut 10 AF, and gained three places. Despite being pushed back 1 place this week, <font color=yellow>#133 Zack Weber</font> made 4 PRs and cut around 1 AF to not lose much ground. <font color=yellow>#236 Timur Ahmad</font> visited this game this week and made a good chunk of 7 PRs, cut over 11 AF, and gained exactly 10 places to finish off this week. The last active player this week was <font color=yellow>#281 Jeff Hensel</font>, who made a great 15 PRs to cut 6 places and over 8 AF.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>Not as big of an influx of site records like the previous two weeks, but this week still yielded two new site records.<br><br><font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'38\"497 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'37\"921</font><br><font color=yellow>Ethan McCormick </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font> time of 0'35\"499 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"487</font><br><br>For the first (full) week of 2011, this activity is very nice, and the consistency of active players seems to be always at least above 30 for the past few weeks, most notably after the new updating system was established. I hope it has encouraged everyone to play! Keep up the activity and progress and I'll see you in two weeks.</b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, I was busy being killed by my fellow karters yesterday among other things so sorry for being a day late on the news update. Nothing out of the ordinary happened this week, so let’s get right to the news! <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Four players joined the site this week. None of them with full timesheets. What a surprise. <br><br><font color=lime>Alexandre Gilet</font> went with the “cool” thing to do on MKWPP and submitted only his 32 course times. They would spot him in at 173rd if the rest of his times were about the same position, but as always less people play flaps so just submitting them increases your position 99% of the time.<br><br><font color=lime> Sergio Mera Gallardo</font> decided whatever Alexandre decided to do was a good plan so he submitted the same 32 times. I can’t say I don’t like it as a player since I don’t move down in AF, but I don’t like it as a site news guy/updater because all those unfinished timesheets are annoying to have on the site. Oh yeah, Sergio would be about 175th with those times, just behind Alexandre.<br><br><font color=lime> Warren Dennis</font> submitted 5 times that would put him 349th, but you can’t really tell anything from 5 times. Hopefully Warren will fill out his timesheet in the coming weeks.<br><br><font color=lime> Timothy Castonguay </font> joined with one time, I’m assuming LC course because everyone finds it necessary to play that first. It’s 530th, but if Timothy keeps studying videos and such he should rise up the ranks quickly.<br> <br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>41 players played this week, a very nice turnout. Nick was right, these news updates seem to be spurring on activity that was lost in my whole absence streak.<br><br>“A welcome to the AF chart” goes out to <font color=yellow>#270 Josh Benson</font>, who only submitted three PRs but it was just enough to get all of his 64 times finally filled. I’m going to make this a recurring section on my news updates since the New Players section never has anybody on the full AF chart. So congrats to you Josh, for pushing past all of the incomplete players on your way to rankitude. <br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>For once most of the Top 10 was active. I would slow down guys, we don’t want to steal MKDS’s thing. In all seriousness, it’s great that the top is playing again, maybe spurred on by the new champion. <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font> and <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> were both playing, each hitting two PRs but not making enough of an improvement to stop from losing some AF. It was nothing huge, but mainly was a result of <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font> playing again. Marco passed Bubbles for the #3 spot with a small comeback of 2 PRs, but it was enough for half a point of AF. He’s been working on MG lately to improve his glitched times so maybe he’ll be moving up more in the future.  <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> was the next to play. Jimmy has been PRing like crazy recently, but only hit 1 PR this week, not enough to avoid losing AF. Still better then Bubbles and STanney who didn’t play, yet I’ve heard rumors of a comeback from Tanney so Jimmy might have to double the effort. <font color=yellow>#7 Tyler McNell</font> came out of nowhere or whatever kartless rock he’s been hiding under to play some this week. He grabbed 8 PRs and cut one AF point, but it might be too late for him to catch Jimmy.  Finally <font color=yellow>#9 Alex Shoal</font> played again, only hitting one PR but keeping up some activity. Artur Bauer is less than an AF point away and Ben Hart has been playing, so any activity is good if Alex wants to hang on to his Top 10 spot.<br><br> <font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Ben Hart</font> was playing this week in an attempt to grab back his Top 10 ranking. He only could manage one PR, and it wasn’t enough to stop the loss of AF. He’s 1.2 points away from Artur and less than 2 away from Alex, so this group should be interesting for weeks to come. <font color=yellow>#14 Eric Hacksell</font> hit one PR, but it wasn’t enough for him to keep from losing AF (I think I’ve said that 5 times now). The good news is even in losing AF, Eric passed James Richards and moved up a spot, showing that even a little bit of playing counts. The only person in this group to actually cut AF was <font color=yellow>#20 Jamie Disley</font>.  Jimbo has been working on his worse PRs and it paid off. He hit 6 PRs but they were enough to bump him all the way up from #25 with a 4 points AF cut. Anyone up here wondering where all of that lost AF came from? Now you know. <font color=yellow>#22 Alvin Le</font> and <font color=yellow>#24 Salvatore Bellusci</font> played, getting 1 and 3 PRs respectively, but didn’t cut AF and both fell on spot due to Jamie’s week.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Here’s where I thought the huge rush of activity was going to come like normal, but this group has been quiet recently.  <font color=yellow>#27 Jay Batten</font> seems to be the only player who has never stopped playing. This week he moved from #29 with 12 PRs and a 3 point AF cut. He bridged a 5 point AF gap in two weeks, at his level that’s impressive. Jay should be in the 11-25s before long. <font color=yellow>#31 Oliver Martin</font> grabbed 2 PRs to cut some AF but didn’t move up any positions, while <font color=yellow>#32 Zane Royal</font> grabbed 2 PRs, didn’t cut any AF and didn’t move up any positions. Further down <font color=yellow>#40 Franco Gubser</font> had a comeback, snatching 7 PRs and moving from #46 to secure his place in the Top 50 for now. None of them seem to be playing so he should be safe. Finally <font color=yellow>#46 Ross Coleman</font>  PRed twice but dropped a spot to fill the void left by Franco. He still has 2 AF to go to catch Andy Lundeen and move up a spot. <br><br> <font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Starting off this group <font color=yellow>#54 Tim van Ham</font> jumps up a spot from last week with a 5 PR effort. A great amount of inactives are between him and the next active karter, <font color=yellow>#62 Agustin Berrios</font>. Agustin hit 5 PRs as well, dropping half an AF point and moving up one place. Nobody is playing in between Tim and Agustin, so maybe they’ll see each other if they make it to the top 50. <font color=yellow>#66 Sebastian Wimmer</font> knocked out 2 PRs, but he can blame Jamie for the fact that he didn’t lose any AF points. Rounding out this group are three active karters. <font color=yellow>#88 John Brunn</font>  lost 1.8 AF points, but he’s in one of those dead zones so he didn’t move up at all. <font color=yellow>#92 Martin Prigent</font> and <font color=yellow>#97 Danny Gallenberger</font>  each played but couldn’t avoid gaining AF. Each gained a place though, which probably makes them feel pretty good. <br><br><font color=red>~~Those Other Guys~~</font><br>We start things off at Mushroom Gorge expert <font color=yellow>#109 Marvin Donjes</font>, who hit 22 PRs to make a daring move from #120 to #109. At this rate Nick should report about his Top 100 spot in no time. Another newcomer who has been making impressive strides is <font color=yellow>#113 Dave Tandy</font>, this time moving from #116 up three positions. The next player down is <font color=yellow>#120 Noah Gordon</font> jumping up a spot to recover from lost positions in the past few weeks. He’s trailed behind by <font color=yellow>#122 Loris Bagnasco</font>, who played with 2 PRs but it wasn’t enough to provoke an AF cut. <font color=yellow>#130 Zack Weber</font> was active, hitting four PRs but gaining three spots, a nice tradeoff. <font color=yellow>#132 Jamal Fluellen</font> was right behind with a small comeback that saw him cutting 6 places with 9 PRs. Jamal tends to have these spurts of PRs that gain him a great amount of positions. <font color=yellow>#150 Tom Norton</font> (who really shouldn’t be ranked this low), submitted 14 PRs which were probably his actual times on the courses. He jumped 23 spots and cut 36 AF points, which was easily the best cut since the last news update. Maybe once he gets a real full timesheet he can be a challenge in the higher ranks. Near the back we find <font color=yellow>#232 Timur Ahmad</font>, who moved from #236 with 7 PRs and a 9 point AF cut. I’m expecting him to move up greatly if he keeps his current progress. Finally <font color=yellow>#259 Tony Fan</font> hit one PR that just barely allowed him to cut a small amount of AF, which is better than his surrounding karters who lost about 1.3 each.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Only one SR this week, but it was enough to cause a minor shakeup in the Site Records table. Sword moved up to be tied for fourth in SRs with 3, and Reiner who was once second in SRs is now reduced to 2 and tied for ninth. <br><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square crs</font> time of 2'05\"561 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'05\"413</font> <br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Time for the first two awards that are actually caught up! This will be a bi-weekly thing, I’ll mention the POWs that did their part to earn the award and why.<br><br>This is a little late but I promised I’d say it in my last update. Nick Meade won the revote over Jorge so he is the real POY 2010 now that everything’s been said and done.<br><br>1st POW Jan (1st - 7th) -  <font color=yellow>Brett Edwards</font> A quiet week here meant that Brett could take the award being ranked lower down. He had the second highest percentage cut (11.5%) and moved up 17 positions with 30 PRs. <br><br>2nd POW Jan (8th - 14th) - <font color=yellow>Jamie Disley</font> Making a nice comeback to the game, Jamie jumped up 5 spots this week barely edging out Jay Batten. With it came an 8.5% cut and 6 PRs.<br><br> That’s it from me. Good luck karting this week everyone!<br>-Web<br></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>One week has passed, and as you guessed it, that means another news update, so let's get to it.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>One new player joined us this week, <font color=lime>Zack McNell</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Not as active as last week, we still have a very solid number of 37 people playing.<br><br>The Top 10 this week was still pretty active, with a return of a player. To start us off, French Champion <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font> made 4 PRs, one of which was the only Site Record this week, beating a very old flap WR on TF. Marco fell back in AF this week though because of the return and insane week of a once active top player. Coming like a freight train, UK Champion <font color=yellow>#4 Shaun Tanney</font> comes out of months of inactivity and makes 13 PRs, which totaled to over 3 AF cut, passing former World Champion David McPartland and put the heat on passing up Marco but falling shy by less than .4 AF. Staying consistent as always, the Australian Champion <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> makes 3 PRs and cuts around .1 AF and tries to keep the distance from very close Tyler McNell. Former Top 10 member <font color=yellow>#9 Ben Hart</font> came back out of inactivity as well this week and improved 4 of his times, cutting over 2 AF, and cushioned himself back into the Top 10 from #11 -> #9. <br> <br>Traveling down the line to the Top 25, three people kept the activity healthy here. Progressing very fast in recent weeks, <font color=yellow>#18 Jay Batten</font> knocked out 15 of his times and cut nearly 5 AF and upped 5 places, #23 -> #18 to enter the Top 20 for the very first time. Trying to not lose ground from Jay, <font color=yellow>#23 Alvin Le</font> dropped back 1 place but improved 2 times, so it sort of evened out a little bit. Always active like Jay, <font color=yellow>#24 Salvatore Bellusci</font> improves 7 of his times as well and comes within maybe 3 or 4 places I'd say by the looks of the AF to Alvin. From maybe #25 to #18 or so the AF gap is only maybe 8-10 AF points, so if this area becomes more active next week, it will be a pretty interesting battle to see who keeps their place and who keeps advancing. <br><br>Further back, going to #26 to #50, the slow down of activity still continues this month, with only 4 people active. Finally arriving at the Top 30, <font color=yellow>#30 Oliver Martin</font> improves 2 times this week but now moves up from #31 to #30 to advance him to the Top 30. Not far behind, <font color=yellow>#32 Brandon Sousui</font> played again and made 2 PRs but lost some ground, and <font color=yellow>#33 Zane Royal</font> upped him 1 more PR with 3, but lost some ground as well. I think the massive improvements of Shaun, Jay, and Salvatore have to blame for that. Finishing up this area, <font color=yellow>#48 Thomas van Deerse</font> decided to play again and drove 3 PRs and cushioned himself at the #48 spot.<br><br>Probably the most active section this week again, 11 people were active in the #51 -> #100 scene. <font color=yellow>#54 Yannick Wiesner</font> makes good progress with 4 new times and cut a little bit of AF, but fell back 2 placements because of Thomas and new AF player Zack. <font color=yellow>#56 Kyle R</font> kept activity alive with 2 PRs this week but lost barely any AF due to other players active around him. Moving up nicely, both <font color=yellow>#59 Liam Ashcroft</font> and <font color=yellow>#60 Matthieu Mayer</font> drove 5 and 9 PRs respectively, cutting around 1.5 AF, but both fell back a place because of Zack joining in at #52. Following the same trend, <font color=yellow>#62 Stacy Needham</font> improved 3 times but still fell back a place. Defying the odds, <font color=yellow>#63 Agustin Berrios</font> breaks the chain of falling back, he drove 5 new times this week and upped 1 place. Making a very big leap right behind Agustin, <font color=yellow>#64 Clement Rouchon</font> makes a bold 19 fresh PRs and puts himself within .1 AF of Agustin. Advancing well, <font color=yellow>#88 John Brunn</font> goes up 1 place this week with 5 new PRs and a nice 1.5 AF cut. Keeping the last area very active, <font color=yellow>#95 Martin Prigent</font> made 5 new PRs and cut some AF but fell back 3 places because he fell victim to the second most active player right behind him. <font color=yellow>#96 Marvin Donjes</font> makes a very big 21 PR streak, cutting over 7 AF and flew up 7 places to join the Top 100 club. <font color=yellow>#100 Fintan Kelly</font> lost 4 places this week because of the more active players around him but still played this week and drove 2 times to solidify him exactly on the #100 spot.<br><br>Looking now, both this section and the #51 -> #100 section were equally active this week with 11 players. Right behind Fintan, <font color=yellow>#101 Danny Gallenberger</font> cut a little bit of AF with 5 fresh times trying to keep his ground from Marvin. Having a really great week, <font color=yellow>#102 Dave Tandy</font> made 16 PRs, which was good for an 8 AF cut and jumped 7 places to #102. Like a lot of the people that were pushed back this week, <font color=yellow>#106 Christian Nemetz</font> was shot back 5 places from #101 but still played this week, making 3 PRs to try and gain some points back. A little farther back, <font color=yellow>#123 Noah Gordon</font> made 4 PRs and cut around 1 AF but lost a place (man it feels like I've said that too many times, I guess the people who made 15+ PRs really blew everyone back far). Being pushed back 3 places, <font color=yellow>#126 Brett Edwards</font> still pulls through with 1 PR this week to keep momentum going into this week. <font color=yellow>#134 Zack Weber</font> made good progress with 5 PRs this week but still inevitably fell back a few places from the more active players. Closing in right behind him, <font color=yellow>#135 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> puts the heat on Zack, making 3 PRs and coming pretty close to overtaking him. Returning to the MKW scene this week, <font color=yellow>#152 Christian Wild</font> got pushed back 2 places but made 7 PRs which cut exactly 2.5 AF to have momentum into this week. Wasting no time joining the AF ranks, <font color=yellow>#155 Tom Norton</font> fell back 3 places but submitted 2 times to keep up the activity. Arriving at the most active player of this week, <font color=yellow>#238 Tony Fan</font> improved nearly half his PR list, cutting nearly 29 AF and flew up 17 placements. Wrapping up this weeks activity, <font color=yellow>#256 Josh Benson</font> had an impressive week as well, having almost a 22 AF cut with 14 new PRs and jumping 16 places.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>Only one new Site Record this week, although it was a very old record beaten.<br><br><font color=yellow>Marc Bas </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory lap</font> time of 0'35\"261 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"252</font><br><br>This weeks news might seem a little bit off looking at the charts now, but the way the news will be done now is that the news will be written up based on the activity on the Sunday of the new update to the next Saturday, not Sunday, because of how late the stats program updates on normal updating day. With that being said, if you generally submit your new times later in the week, make sure you do it by at least mid day on Saturdays!</b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Back on track with the Sunday updates this week, let’s check out how the karting has happened this week. This news update covers from 1/23/11 to 1/29/11, so if you PRed today, sorry but you’re not included in this week’s news. If you didn’t catch the end of Meade’s update, we’re doing it that way now just because the stats program likes to update late, and the news we were reporting was inconsistent week to week. One issue might be later times sent on Saturday, since I’m still trying to figure out when the stats program updates every day. Don’t worry; you’ll be mentioned next week.<br>Enough rambling, on to the news.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Three new guys this week. An old MK vet, a WW Holder on the Online rankings, and some guy I’ve never heard of. <br><br><font color=lime>Brendon Shaw</font> submitted 18 times, which is a pretty random number. Hopefully he’ll boost it up to 64 in the coming weeks. The times are 350th if every other chart was in dead last, so he still has a lot of ground to improve on.<br><br><font color=lime>Jak Russo</font> joined with 32 times, the courses including a few Top 10 times and a very nice DDR time. Hopefully (but I doubt it) he’ll submit those flaps and add one to the rankings of the site. He’s 183rd with the flaps to go, a very nice ranking to start out.<br><br><font color=lime>Karlo Tomazelli</font> MK64 Current #3 decided to join this week with 43 times, much better than the 32 that many decide is the standard. With his success in MK64 maybe he can gain skill in another MK, let’s see if he gets a full timesheet first. <br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>33 players played this week, which is much smaller than past weeks. There are 11 messages that couldn’t make it into this update, and I’m sorry about that, I didn’t have much time to update yesterday. Those 11 messages might have made the difference between this and a number in the 40s. Oh well, at least it isn’t on a Monday like the last two weeks.<br><br>“A welcome to the AF chart” goes out to <font color=yellow>#32 Kevin Mason</font>, who was near the very top of the “Incomplete Timesheet Rankings” but decided to fill out his 64 times this week. It’s a good thing he did because he entered very high in the charts, and bumped down about 330 players a spot. <font color=yellow> #125 Viktor Silivanov </font> also joined the charts, submitting the one PR he needed to make it on, and moving in at a nice starting position. Maybe he’ll reach the Top 100 soon enough.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Two guys were active here, not as much as the last weeks. However due to much of the main field playing below, they both lost AF. It wasn’t as much as the other 8 guys that weren’t playing, but it didn’t help them advance as much as they would have liked. <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> hit 2 PRs and shortened the gap between him and #3 Shaun Tanney to a tenth of an AF Point. Shaun, Marc, and Bubbles are separated by less than a point, so even inactivity could shift things around. <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> had a sole PR to contribute this week, and it saved him from gaining four tenths of a point, he only gained one tenth. It’s a long way to Bubbles, 9 AF points. Jimmy doesn’t seem to have given up these past months, all he has to do is keep cutting AF week to week. <br><br> <font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>First one playing in this group is <font color=yellow>#15 Jay Batten</font>, who has surpassed all expectations and virtually come out of nowhere in the past month or so. He jumped up three spots from #18 this week. His 8 PRs were a good choice, because otherwise he would have been passed by <font color=yellow>#17 Cole Gilbert</font>. Cole made another one of his random PR sprees; three PRs were enough to move up three spots as Cole tries to hang on to his Top 25 position. With all of the recent activity going on it’s probably a good move to try and work out a few PRs. <font color=yellow>#22 Salvatore Bellusci</font> was nearing the back of the group at #24 but moved up two positions this week. <font color=yellow>#23 Alvin Le</font> karted himself into an exact tie with Marvin Rekovsky. Even though Alvin lost AF, he lost less than Marvin, causing them to be tied. Who will emerge on top? Check out next week. No one dropped out of this group this week, since no new players finished their timesheets high enough and nobody below decide to make a nice jump upwards, so Leif Leopold is safe this week.<br><br> <font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#30 Oliver Martin</font> was back in action this week, notching one PR but still losing about half a point of AF. He has around a point to go in order to pass the next player so maybe with a strong showing next week he can achieve it. After Kevin Mason’s entry at #32, everyone automatically moved down a spot and had to work in order to maintain their positions. <font color=yellow>#34 Zane Royal</font> experienced the cruel punishments of this entry by cutting about a tenth of a point but losing a place. But my goal every week is to cut at least one place of AF (or .0156), because you’ll move up eventually against the inactives. <font color=yellow>#36 Daniel Raferty</font> hit two PRs, most likely on Rainbow Road with a kart, but still lost half a point of AF. I’d say next week he might have a little better showing, call it a hunch.  Finally <font color=yellow>#41 Thomas van Deerse</font> jumped up four positions with 5 PRs and a decent 2.5 AF cut, and <font color=yellow>#48 Zack McNell</font> made it into the Top 50 from #52 with 8 PRs, displacing Max Anossow from the group and leaving Andy Lundeen on the bubble. <br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#55 Liam Ashcroft</font> starts of the activity here, by karting his way to two PRs. They weren’t enough to provoke an AF cut but they helped him not slide as far backwards. Lash should get into action this week though, because he might get caught by <font color=yellow>#57 Tim van Ham</font>, who hit 4 PRs and jumped from #59. Looking at the dust left by Tim is former POQ contender <font color=yellow>#61 Matthieu Mayer</font>, with 3 PRs and slowing down in activity a little. Maybe he’s taking a short break to come into full force later on. <font color=yellow>#63 Agustin Berrios</font> doesn’t really care either way, since he made a nice .8 point AF cut to clear a small gap that he’s stuck between now. <font color=yellow>#71 Sebastian Wimmer</font>  made a cut to his AF but due to Kevin’s joining still dropped down a place. Luckily he has a lot of room ahead and behind him of inactive karters. <font color=yellow>#81 John Brunn</font> jumped from #85 solely because he wanted #61, #71, and #81 active in the same week. Although I completely doubt that, he did grab 12 PRs throughout the 7 days. <font color=yellow>#95 Marvin Donjes</font>  has been attempting to fight his way through an 8 point AF gap, and he’s almost there. He just missed passing a player, and ended up dropping back a place because of Kevin, who I’m sure not a lot of people ranked below #32 like that much this week. Marvin did hit 12 PRs and cut 4.5 AF points. He’s been on fire lately, and there seems to be no limit to his cuts. Finally my favorite karter for no apparent reason, <font color=yellow>#100 Danny Gallenberger</font> fought his way back in to the Top 100 from #101, as Luke Berrill and Fintan Kelly lost their spots. On a random note to show you how much MKW has been active lately, only a few updates I mentioned Justin Best dropping out of the Top 100, and now he’s all the way back at #115. Moral of the Story : Stop karting, drop like a rock.<br><br><font color=red>~~The Forgotten Karters~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#104 Christian Nemetz</font> was in the Top 100 a few months ago, but activity has pushed him out. As he eyed the car of Danny Gallenberger, he surged forward two places with a 3 PR week, with hopefully more to come. Next we find <font color=yellow>#121 Dexter Howe</font>, who finally dropped the 110s tag in a bad way. He hits one PR this week that lost him AF, but not as much as Paul Tanney who he jumps over to retain his position (Kevin’s fault again). <font color=yellow>#124 Noah Gordon</font> hit 2 PRs and almost stayed even on AF (losing about .18), but lost a spot. Then Viktor joined and caused #126 and below to lose two spots from the get go. A little lower, <font color=yellow>#136 Zack Weber</font> experiences the pain of that new entry, as he slips two spots in the charts with a .3 AF cut and 4 PRs. <font color=yellow>#147 Chris Wild</font> moved up 5 spots with 8 PRs, and if he didn’t have to be so good on the other karts and could spend more time on MKW, I’m sure he could move up. I guess I’ll just enjoy my lead on him while I can. Finally near the bottom <font color=yellow>#342 Quassim Weber</font> sent in a 16 PR effort that moved him up three spots, and netted him 5 AF points. With nobody active almost 200 spots above him, he just has to cut AF week to week and the players should start falling. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>No new SRs this week, although as soon as the week ended a bunch of people caught on fire to grab some more, Nick gets more fun next week.  <br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Only one POW segment in the time since I updated. Look for 4th POW and January POM next time I write.<br>3rd POW Jan (15th - 21st) -  <font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney</font> made a nice comeback and jumped past Bubbles for #4, and soon afterwards went on to pass Marc and reclaim his #3 position. <br><br>Time to study for exams. I hate physics. See you guys in two weeks!<br>-Web</b><br></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>This past week has been such a crazy week. You thought averaging maybe 37-40 or so players a week for the past few weeks/months is a lot? That's nothing compared to this week leading up into the beginning of February. A total of 55 people were active this week, so let's see where the action is at.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>One less than last week, but two new people join us this week, one is a SMK and MKDD vet and another one I'm pretty sure is a wifi player. The new players respectively are <font color=lime>Aron Langerak and Hugo Queniat</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Compared to our 33 active players last week, we had a very big increase in players active this week. We had 55 players active this week, and I think this is the most players that have ever played in a week (from at least I could remember) from probably the beginning of the game. <br><br>Probably at a new time high in a very long time, a total of 7 people of the Top 10 played this week. <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font> cut a little bit of AF with 1 new time this week to edge closer to 4 AF. Making a couple of times, United States Champion <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> made 4 new times, but cut very little because of the high volume of activity from the people behind. Speaking of which, right behind Nick, UK Champion <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> makes a big group of 11 PRs and cut nearly 1 AF point, stretching his newly acquired #3 slot from Marco, but he doesn't let him get away so easy as <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> cut a little over half an AF point with 3 new PRs to keep less than 1 AF of Shaun. 2 places back, Australian Champion <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> keeps his consistent activity flowing with 2 new times but loses around a quarter of an AF point to very active Tyler behind him. <font color=yellow>#7 Tyler McNell</font> put on his A-game this week driving home 6 new times and cut a little over 1 and a half AF points to shorten the gap on Jimmy, I'm pretty sure Tyler and Jimmy will be pretty close rivals as they keep traveling to #5 David McPartland. Finishing off this area this week, Canadian Champion <font color=yellow>#10 Alex Shoal</font> lost a little bit of ground probably because of the high activity above and below him, but he still managed to make 2 new PRs to solidify his #10 spot.      <br><br>Like the Top 10, a very solid amount of activity going from #11 to #25 this week. Spanish Champion <font color=yellow>#12 Tony Ruiz</font> keeps working for the Top 10 spot, PRing twice and cut close to half an AF point. Continuing reckless activity, <font color=yellow>#13 Jay Batten</font> further improves 11 times, good for close to 3 AF cut and jumped 2 places and is within around .2 AF of Tony. Trying not to lose too much AF from Jay, Swedish Champion <font color=yellow>#15 Eric Hacksell</font> lost only about .1 AF but still made 1 new time to level out the losses almost. <font color=yellow>#17 Cole Gilbert</font> lost barely any AF as well but still managed to PR twice this week to keep his #17 spot. <font color=yellow>#22 Salvatore Bellusci</font> was the last player active in this section, who managed to improve 4 times and cut around 1 AF and pushes him very close to passing Daniel and being 1 spot from the Top 20.<br><br>A very pleasant surprise as the #26 to #50 group sparks with a pretty big deal of activity this week. Returning (?) to the Top 30, <font color=yellow>#29 Fabien Jacques</font> made a very large 1.7 AF cut with only 2 PRs, and slots himself 1 spot higher and dents himself into the Top 30. I put him as \"Returning (?)\" since I think I've seen him in the Top 30 before, but I may have mixed him up with another French player, but yeah. XD Not letting him get away easy, <font color=yellow>#31 Oliver Martin</font> stays active right behind him, setting 4 new times, jumped 1 place, and cut a little over 1.5 AF. Starting to make a stab at a few AF point gap between #32 and himself, <font color=yellow>#33 Zane Royal</font> makes 3 new times and cut close to half an AF point, bring down the gap from him and Sebeny to around 3 AF. Behind him, <font color=yellow>#33 Kevin Mason</font> got pushed back a place and around half an AF but still made 1 new time to come back a little bit. 3 places back, Irish Champion <font color=yellow>#36 Daniel Raftery</font> stayed in the same place, but still managed to cut around an AF with 2 new times, one of which is a new Site Record @ RR. Arriving at exactly the Top 40 club spot, <font color=yellow>#40 Thomas van Deerse</font> managed to move up 1 place with cutting only about .2 AF with 3 PRs but puts his foot in the Top 40 spot. Making very fast progress right behind Thomas, <font color=yellow>#41 Zack McNell</font> made 10 PRs good for an impressive 4 AF cut and jumped 7 places to be around .1 AF behind Thomas which separates him from entering the Top 40. Making a huge jump himself too, <font color=yellow>#46 Matthieu Mayer</font> made a big 26 PR string which cut around 15 AF and jumped him 15 spots to join the Top 50. Finishing off, <font color=yellow>#49 Liam Ashcroft</font> gets in with the big volume activity himself with a good deal of 13 PRs which cut him a little over 4 AF and a 5 place jump, which pushes Ross Coleman out of the Top 50. <br><br>Moving on to #51 -> #100, this is generally where our biggest part of activity is, but this week only 4 people were active. <font color=yellow>#58 Tim van Ham</font> cut around half an AF point with 3 new times but was still bumped back a place. Progressing well, <font color=yellow>#73 John Brunn</font> made 14 new times and cut just above 10 AF points and pushed him up 8 places making him not very far from joining the Top 70 now. <font color=yellow>#82 Emmanuel Amador</font> cut a good deal of AF as well, cranking out 13 PRs good for almost a 6 AF dent from his previous AF to drive himself 2 places better and comes close to passing former Champion Michael Fried. Coming to the most active player this week, <font color=yellow>#84 Marvin Donjes</font> improved close to half his sheet with 28 new times, cut well over 12 AF and jumped 11 placements. Closing out this area, <font color=yellow>#86 Thibaud Bourdeau</font> made a good batch of 10 PRs himself good for about a 3 AF cut but fell back 1 place.<br><br>The most active group of the update goes to the #101 and beyond group this week with a great number of 14 people playing. Very very close to the Top 100 is <font color=yellow>#103 Biagio Macula</font> who made a good batch of 11 PRs this week which moved him along 10 places and a 10 AF cut to put himself in easy striking distance of the elusive Top 100. I guess 10 is a popular number people chose to have this week as <font color=yellow>#114 Noah Gordon</font> copied what Biagio did. Noah managed to improve 8 of his times which cut 10 placements and a little over 6 AF points. Right behind him, <font color=yellow>#115 Fredrick Hutchington</font> made a nice 13 PRs good for over 8 AF to defy cutting 10 places because he cut 12. It seems like a pretty big trend where people are making big leaps of fate and cutting large amounts of places this week, good stuff! <font color=yellow>#119 Andre Hoelscher</font> cut around 5 and a half AF good for a 7 place jump to his new resting spot at #119. <font color=yellow>#123 Dexter Howe</font> made 2 PRs this week which cut close to half an AF, but because of the high volume of activity around him, he fell back 1 spot. Coming within 1 AF of Dexter, <font color=yellow>#124 Viktor Silivanov</font> made 3 PRs to push him up a spot and cut a little over 1 and a half AF. Making a dent into Top 130, <font color=yellow>#128 Loris Bagnasco</font> drove home 9 PRs which was good for a 2 place bump up and close to a 5 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#136 Zack Weber</font> keeps pace with 1 PR to cut himself a little bit to make up for lost ground this week. <font color=yellow>#143 Christian Wild</font> keeps his wild activity going (yeah bad joke) with 5 new times to drive himself up 4 places and cut almost 3 AF points. A few places back, <font color=yellow>#149 Tom Norton</font> makes almost a 2 AF cut with 1 PR (I'm pretty sure this may have been a correction on his DS flap or one of his new SGB PRs). Either way, this slots him up 2 spots and puts him in the Top 150 now. Jumping farther back, MKDS specialist <font color=yellow>#232 Timur Ahmad</font> returns to this game this week to improve 8 times and cut more than 13 AF, improving 8 placements. <font color=yellow>#241 Tony Fan</font> got pushed back 1 place from Timur, but still improved 1 time this week to not lose so much AF. Our second most active player this week I think, <font color=yellow>#284 Alvaro Fababu</font> made a batch of 25 PRs to cut over 40 (yeah I said it) AF to cut 24 placements. I think that is the biggest AF jump I've seen in a single week, that's awesome. Finally finishing up this weeks activity, <font color=yellow>#327 Kevin Pillinger</font> made 2 new times to bump himself up 1 place and about .2 AF.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>Two new Site Records this week, one being the return of Lee on DDR and the kart grabbing a WR again and the first God (flap) time on RR.<br><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> time of 1'48\"908 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'48\"573</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Raftery </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> time of 0'48\"000 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'47\"993</font><br><br>Very interesting week if I do say so myself. With 55 people active, it makes me wonder if this keeps going on for the whole year, what the record will be for the most active week of 2011 / the whole history of the game so far. Keep playing and we will find out with time, see you guys around.</b></p>",

Luckily for me, activity was low this week but the players that were active made some very nice moves.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Nobody new joined this week. I guess they like Nick better than me.<br> <br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>26 players were active this week, which is beginning to make me think that people like to read Nick’s news updates more than mine. Or maybe I just smell. Either way, the people that decided to play this week get to be in a more exclusive club.<br>“A welcome to the AF chart” goes out to nobody, the players with incomplete timesheets electing to stay that way for the 7 days. At least that’s good news for the hard working full-timesheet field, as they didn’t drop a spot due to a randomly appearing opponent.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Although only 26 players were playing, the Top 10 was full of activity as it has in the past month or so. <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> played a little and hit a few PRs, but slid back and lost positioning to his opponents. This is mainly because <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> is suring back for his #3 spot. Even though Marc only hit 2 PRs, they were great for his positioning, causing him to cut 1% off his AF and bring him within .4 of STanney. This is shaping up to be an impressive battle for #3, and I’m excited to see how it concludes. <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> stayed in place, but distanced himself from Tyler McNell. He still has a while to go (11 AF points) before hitting Bubbles and #5, but if he cuts AF week to week and Bubbles stays retired he’ll slowly make up the distance. A newcomer to the Top 10 from last week, although quite familiar with it is <font color=yellow>#8 Dustin Enders</font>. He jumped from #14 back into the Top 10. He’s never been able to push very far into the Top 10, so hopefully he can surge toward Tyler McNell about 1 AF point ahead. <font color=yellow>#9 Mark Schmidt</font> hit 4 PRs but it wasn’t enough to stop Dustin. These two have battled back and forth over the German crown for some time, and I doubt the battle is over judging from the past few months. Alex Shoal is knocked out of the Top 10 this week for the first time in many months, maybe even years, showing how no one is safe when the top is active.<br><br> <font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Five players played here, a decent amount of activity in a group that is normally decently active. <font color=yellow>#12 Jay Batten</font>, aka the karter that never stops moved up one place, clearing Artur Bauer. Alex is .9 points away, and then the Top 10’s gates are just off in the distance. Jay might reach the Top next week if he keeps up his never-ending progress. <font color=yellow>#15 Eric Hacksell</font> had 4 PRs, including a very nice SR on DKSC flap, which cut him a little over half a point of AF. Slotting in right behind him is <font color=yellow>#16 Jamie Disley</font>, moving up from #18 with a 5 PR week. Farther back is <font color=yellow>#21 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who was a pick of many to make the Top 20 this year. He might achieve that next week with his jump from #22 since last time. <font color=yellow>#23 Alvin Le</font> seems to be always active with 1 or 2 PRs a week, and hit 2 this time. He distanced himself from his pursuers by just breaking even on AF. <br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Only four players were active here, where most of the activity normally is. <font color=yellow>#26 Fabien Jacques</font> might be up into the Top 25 and make this group even more inactive sooner than expected. He jumped from #28 this week and is only .7 away from Leif Leopold and the Top 25. At least Leif didn’t lose his last SR and drop out of the Top 25 in the same week. <font color=yellow>#30 Oliver Martin and #32 Zane Royal</font> hit 1 and 2 PRs respectively, but they weren’t enough to prevent ground from being lost. Finally, <font color=yellow>#43 Liam Ashcroft</font>, who has really been making ground lately moved from #47 with only 4 PRs, a PR per position, which is pretty efficient.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>This group doesn’t start up until <font color=yellow>#70 John Brunn</font>, who made a jump from three spots down with 7 PRs. It was about 4.7 AF and now he’s in the exact middle of a gap, with about 4 points away from catching #69. If achieved he’ll probably slip under 100 AF, which is a great accomplishment, so it’s something to aim for. <font color=yellow>#74 Emmanuel Amador</font> hit 8 PRs and cut a little less than 6 AF points. It moved him up five spots from #79 and maybe he can catch John and sub 100 AF as well. <font color=yellow>#82 Marvin Donjes</font> is trying to pull a Jay Batten, as he’s been active and moving up for the past month or so. He hit 14 PRs this week and moved up a spot, now sitting directly behind ex-champ and MK Combined #1 Michael Fried. It’s a big jump to make but only .3 AF away, can DonkeyLaser do it? Finally, a mini-rivalry just emerged at the very bottom of the group, maybe in fear of dropping out of the Top 100. <font color=yellow>#97 Martin Prigent</font> hit 5 PRs to cut .8906 AF and retain his position. <font color=yellow>#98 Danny Gallenberger</font> hit 1 PR to cut .8125 AF and retain his position. And <font color=yellow>#99 Andre Hoelscher</font> hit 19 PRs to cut 16 points of AF and move from #119. All three are very close now, so who will emerge on top? And can they all remain in the illustrious Top 100? Daniel Pascua, the old king of DKSC drops out of the Top 100 this week, and another powerful face of the past falls victim to rising stars. <br><br><font color=red>~~The Field~~</font><br>Not a lot of activity here, but the few that played benefited, and the inactives only suffered a little. <font color=yellow>#123 Dexter Howe</font> went from king of the 110s to the epic numerical position of the charts, so not much was lost. He hit 2 PRs for a tenth of AF to be subtracted. <font color=yellow>#145 Tom Norton</font> shouldn’t really be down here, but he is for now. He submitted 3 new PRs, probably Top 10 times, and jumped 3.4 AF points, as well as 4 places. When he gets a real full timesheet he could be a great force near the top. <font color=yellow>#241 Tony Fan</font> was also active submitting his kart timesheet. I’m wondering where the highest kart-only player is ranked on the site, as I doubt there are many. Finally,<font color=yellow>#246 Andrea Gardina</font> returned to the active scene with 4 PRs, causing about 1 AF to drop off and a move up a place from #247. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>A lot of SR activity, but only three changed hands. The rest of the SRs were champions improving their dominance. <br><br><font color=yellow>Marvin Donjes </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'09\"412 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"397</font><br><font color=yellow>Eric Hacksell </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font> time of 0'35\"487 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"410</font><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> time of 1'48\"573 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'48\"418</font><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins lap</font> time of 0'33\"399 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"371</font><br><font color=yellow>Jak Russo </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road crs</font> time of 2'27\"916 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'27\"884</font> <br><br>With Jorge’s lost SR, Romain Smadja reclaims his title for most SRs with 9 and breaks the tie with Jorge. Jak Russo and Eric Hacksell join tied for 13th with a sole SR each, and Leif Leopold is bumped off the list.<br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Final POW for January, first POW for February, and the Jan POM had to be awarded, so I was busy looking at the stats program. <br><br>4th POW Jan (22nd -> 31st) -  <font color=yellow>Liam Ashcroft</font> had the second highest % AF cut with a 6.7% cut, as well as jumping from #59 ->#54. <br><br>1st POW Feb (1st -> 7th) - <font color=yellow>Matthieu Mayer</font> returned to the scene with a 16% cut and a move from #61 ->#46. Will he continue playing, or quiet down again? <br><br>Jan POM - <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font> had a very nice month, and is displacing karters left and right. He moved from #29 -> #15 with a 26.9% cut and 34 PRs. How high can he go? His potential seems endless. <br><br>Hope you enjoyed the news. See you in two weeks!<br>-Web<br></p>",

United States Champion <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> tried to make some progress with 3 improvements but still lost some AF from the very active players in the Top 10. One of them being UK Champion <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font>. Shaun has been on a huge roll since he has come back, improving impressively 8 times, picking up a WR for the first time in over a year, and cut a little bit over half an AF point to try and stretch away from Marco. French Champion <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> has been on fire ever since he came back as well, making a solid 5 times improved which cut almost an AF keeping the distance with Shaun and himself within around half an AF point, a very intense battle. Making nice progress as well upon his return, <font color=yellow>#7 Tyler McNell</font> made 7 new PRs and cut almost an AF point, closing the gap on the Australian Champ Jimmy to ~1.xxx AF and trying to fend off the three players behind him trying to get his spot. Making another return, <font color=yellow>#8 Mark Schmidt</font> cut a little AF with 3 new PRs and is very very close to retaining his German Champ status from Dustin Enders. And to finish this area off, the guy who never stops improving, yes you guessed right, <font color=yellow>#10 Jay Batten</font> continues his very consistent activity with about an AF point cut and 5 new times. These prolonged battles and new battles arising are very interesting to watch if you guys have been following along the past couple of weeks.<br><br>Following up the Top 10 activity, 4 people were active to the 25th placement this week. Pushing further into the mid Top 20 section, <font color=yellow>#16 Jamie Disley</font> cut some AF with 4 fresh new times, coming closer to Eric Hacksell. A little farther back, <font color=yellow>#21 Salvatore Bellsuci</font> lost about half an AF point but still managed to find his way to improve 5 times, one of which was regaining his MG 3lap WR. <font color=yellow>#23 Alvin Le</font> lost about the same AF but decided to only improve one time this week, so the gap between him and #22 Daniel Anderson is around 1 and a half AF now. Feeling ambitious, <font color=yellow>#25 Fabien Jacques</font> makes the first placement hop of the update, going from 26th to 25th to join this paragraph of updates, cutting roughly .2 AF with 2 new times. Less than 1 AF separates him from #24 and beyond as of now.<br><br>Coming to #26 to #50, a very good number of 8 people played, with some rather big movements. Staring us off, <font color=yellow>#29 Oliver Martin</font> successfully leaps from #30 to #29 to really get into the \"feel\" of the Top 30. He cut just about 2 AF with 4 new times to finish off this week. Two places back, <font color=yellow>#31 Kevin Mason</font> made 6 new times for a big 4 AF cut and made a 2 place jump, very very close to the Top 30 now. <font color=yellow>#33 Zane Royal</font> got pushed back in the process losing about half an AF point but still made 2 new times to not lose as much ground. Irish Champion <font color=yellow>#35 Daniel Raftery</font> made 7 new times, one of which is a new SR on RR 1lap, and cut about 2 AF and jumped a place. Coming to a very big cut, <font color=yellow>#37 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font>, aka the person I always typo when I update, submits PRs from November until now, cutting over 27 AF with 34 PRs and cut exactly 30 places, #67 -> #37. Right behind him, <font color=yellow>#38 Thomas van Deerse</font> had a good week too, cutting 4 places with 12 PRs to cut about 4 AF and moved up 4 places to join the Top 40 crowd. Completing the trio, <font color=yellow>#39 Liam Ashcroft</font> joined the Top 40 himself, #43 -> #39 with a batch of 6 new times good for a little over 2 AF cut. Closing us out on this area, <font color=yellow>#44 Zack McNell</font> found himself knocked back one place because of the people passing him but he still played this week and made one new time to prepare him for next week.<br><br>Top 100 territory gives us the most activity this week with 11 players improving their times. Starting almost at #50, Japanese Champion <font color=yellow>#51 Harp Valentine</font> started to play again with two new times, but got knocked back one place from the people who passed him up during the past few days. The next three people also got kicked back a place, but in the end still cut AF rather than losing it. <font color=yellow>#58 Yannick Wiesner</font> was the first one pushed back, but made 6 new PRs good to cut himself well over an AF point to have an ~4 place gap to get back to 57th. Behind him, <font color=yellow>#59 Tim van Ham</font> was the second one who still cut AF despite being pushed back, driving in 3 new times for close to an AF point cut. <font color=yellow>#60 Kyle R</font> had an identical week as well, with 3 PRs and roughly the same AF cut, trying to shorten the gap between him and Tim + Yannick. Two places back, <font color=yellow>#62 Agustin Berrios</font> changed it up and jumped one placement instead of being pushed back, with a good batch of 14 new times and a 3.2 AF cut. Only 3 AF separates him from the Top 60 now. <font color=yellow>#70 John Brunn</font> continues nicely with 3 new times and cut over an AF cut, he didn't gain any places, but he made a good dent in the gap between him and getting deep into the Top 60. Keeping up with John, <font color=yellow>#71 Sofie Wimmer</font> didn't really cut all that much AF because of the players active around Sofie, but still managed to make 3 new times to start decreasing the lead John has over her. Making consistent progress the past weeks, <font color=yellow>#77 Marvin Donjes</font> keeps it up with a 2+ AF cut, moved up 3 placements in the process and drove 12 new times. With an intense week, <font color=yellow>#95 Danny Gallenberger</font> PRd one third of his times sheet, jumping 3 places good for a 11 AF cut. Despite being passed, <font color=yellow>#97 Martin Prigent</font> still kept his place since he cut over 1 AF with 5 new PRs to not lose ground. Finishing up here, <font color=yellow>#98 Andre Hoelscher</font> had a good week, gaining one more place with a 4 AF cut and 7 new times. <br><br>Keeping around the same level of activity, \"The Field\" as Zack would say, had 7 people active to close this news update. Starting us off, <font color=yellow>#106 Christian Nemetz</font> continues to make progress to the Top 100 with a solid 1 AF improvement with 4 new times and stays at his 106th spot. With only two new times this week, <font color=yellow>#114 Noah Gordon</font> jumped two places with each PR to get him closer to joining the Top 100 group as well. Not far behind, <font color=yellow>#120 Dexter Howe</font> made a 3 placement jump into the Top 120 with a little over 1 AF cut and 4 new PRs. <font color=yellow>#138 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> made a good 2 AF cut with 3 new times to set him up for next week. <font color=yellow>#140 Christian Wild</font> found some time to play this game instead of SMK this week and jumped 3 places with 3 new times, cutting 2 AF like Tomas. 7 places back, <font color=yellow>#147 Tom Norton</font> fell back 2 places this week, but only made one new time, which is a new rSGB 3lap WR. The last player active of this update was <font color=yellow>#227 Tony Fan</font>. He made an impressive 15+ AF cut with PRing one third of his times sheet and jumped 14 places, good work.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>Very large amount of Site Records accumulated this past week and even more today for next week.<br><br><font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'37\"921 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'36\"845</font><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins lap</font> time of 0'33\"371 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"176</font><br><font color=yellow>Jak Russo </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road crs</font> time of 2'27\"884 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'27\"599</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Raftery </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> time of 0'47\"993 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'47\"931</font><br><font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 lap</font> time of 0'15\"019 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'14\"983</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach crs</font> time of 1'22\"238 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'22\"167</font><br><br>As this update comes to a close, interesting news awaits next weeks update, so stay tuned.

        "content": "<p><b>For all you news-desiring karters, your wishes are finally fulfilled. Because of personal issues, I couldn’t write the news last week, but this week you get twice the fun, and so do I!<br><br>This update covers news from 2/20/11 to 3/5/11. Meade will pick up the weekly updates again on Sunday. Good news about this is I finally got an active week. Anyway, enough intro text you don’t care about, and on to the important stuff.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Five new guys this week, which is a little more than twice the usual. I guess it makes sense, but why I put this sentence in the news update really doesn’t.<br><br><font color=lime>Andre Riviere</font> had 50 times sent in to the site. He’s about 319th now, but the other times will surely help him cut AF points. (and join the main chart as well, but nobody ever does that).<br><font color=lime> Victor Zanchi</font> slots in at about 200th, but only has 32 times as opposed to Andre. With a full timeset he could probably get close, if not into the Top 100, so I would recommend keeping up the progress on submissions!<br><font color=lime> Mohsen Mazza</font> defied all odds and actually entered the full AF chart in his first week, moving in at 241st. Technically, defying the odds is entering after not submitting a full timeset (it’s either first week or never), but Mohsen deserves some credit for actually writing down his flaps.<br><font color=lime> Logan Fournier</font> had 7 times, which really doesn’t show that much about his skill, except for the fact that he’s sitting at 344th (if every one of his other times was dead last ranked), also meaning he’s beating about 30 people on the main AF chart with 7 times, which I guess is an achievement within itself.<br>Finally, <font color=lime>Remy Faure </font> had the most impressive entry out of anyone, submitting 32 times but showing up as a ghost hovering over 191st. With flaps, he should easily be able to get near the Top 100 like Victor.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>That’s the longest the New Players section has been in a while, but now it’s time for the real fun, as the last 14 days brought 80 active players to the MKW page. Who said MKW was slowing down? <br><br>“A welcome to the AF chart” other than Mohsen entering in his first week goes out to <font color=yellow>#17 Jak Russo</font>, who had some very nice DDR times on entry and now enters at a very good chart position. Let’s see if he starts to drop, or can maintain or improve.  Also, <font color=yellow>#29 Alexandre Gilet</font>, who submitted 10 new PRs and jumped in at an impressively high position. I’m not sure if he’s been lurking in the non-complete zone for a while or if he’s new, but the Top 30, no matter how you enter it, is impressive. Also, <font color=yellow>#292 Julian Stephens </font> moved in at a slightly lower position, however I’m sure we haven’t heard the last of him yet. <br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Starting at the Top, the Elite 10 MKW members have been quite active recently, and this week(s) was no different. <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> is pretty much always active, and he kept up the PRs this week. He grabbed 6 overall, but it wasn’t enough to stop from the natural weekly AF gain. <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> has been on fire recently, and is quickly becoming a force in the rankings again. He hit 17 PRs in this two-week span, and cut 1.5 AF, trying to bridge the huge 7 point gap to Meade. <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> hit 5 PRs to hold his ground, and distance himself slightly from Bubbles. <font color=yellow>#6 Jimmy Benson</font> knocked out 6 PRs, and is now about 10 AF away from Bubbles, or more depressingly, 640 place improvements. Anyone think <font color=yellow>#7 Jay Batten</font> would slow down? I sure hope not, because as usual, he made a massive move. 26 PRs allowed him to make a move from #10 to #7. Jay is running out of chart positions, so I’m really not sure how he can top this recent progress. Finally, <font color=yellow>#8 Mark Schmidt</font> hit 13 PRs, passing Tyler McNell (who had a really bad week, #7 - #9) and putting a nice 3 AF buffer on his German title from #10 Dustin Enders. Glad to have this group nice and active again.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Jamie Disley</font> jumped from #16 with his current comeback, displacing both #12 Ben Hart and #13 Alex Shoal, frequent members in the Top 10. <font color=yellow>#15 Tony Ruiz and #16 Eric Hacksell</font> both were active with 4 and 1 PRs respectively, however due to Jamie’s huge move both dropped down a spot overall. After Jak’s entry at #17, we find <font color=yellow>#20 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who several (including yours truly) projected in the Top 20 positions. With his 10 PRs he made a massive 6 place jump, showing to the MKW world he belongs in this elite group. Finally, <font color=yellow>#23 Alvin Le</font> hit 3 PRs, but even with a .4 AF cut lost a place due to Jak entering so highly on the charts.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#28 Oliver Martin</font> hit 2 PRs, but sadly dropped one spot again due to Jak. He narrowly avoided dropping two however, as Alexandre popped in at #29. Next up in the 30s we reach a huge group of activity. <font color=yellow>#32 Lucas Acek, #33 Kevin Mason, and #34 Zane Royal</font> looked at each other for a rivalry this last fortnight, and played 3, 2, and 3 PRs respectively. The first two of this threesome lost two spots, and Zane lost one (or gained one technically and then lost two from newcomers), so they all have spots to fight back for next update. <font color=yellow>#36 Thomas van Deerse and #37 Liam Ashcroft</font> played together as well. However unlike the last group, each moved up two spots instead of losing ground. The two opposite trains may collide if the trends continue, for one long train that could probably screw over your times on a game like MK64. (+3 update points if you get the reference).  <font color=yellow>#39 Daniel Raftery</font> was too busy working on RR to cut that much ground, and hit 2 PRs for a net loss of 5 places, which is mainly because of newcomers and annoying trains. <font color=yellow>#41 Alberto Fiorese</font> dropped 2.6 AF points, yet still lost a spot, showing the harsh reality of AF gaps and active MK sites. The third train of this group involved <font color=yellow>#43 Franco Gubser, #44 Zack McNell, and #45 Matthieu Mayer</font>. This train was a little confused, because last update Matthieu was in 43rd, Franco in 44th, and Zack in 45th, but they decided to make a car switch and Matthieu was left on the back. Franco made a .98 AF cut with 8 PRs, so nice week for him. Finally, <font color=yellow>#48 Kyle R</font>, who might work for some secret agency due to the fact that his last name is classified hit 5 PRs to vault into the Top 50 from 54th and perform more stealth and espionage operations on the upper workings of the MKW players. All I can say is, we’re on to you Kyle.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#52 Agustin Berrios</font> hit his first SR on DC 3lap this update, notching up another achievement on his resume. Before long he should move into the Top 50, and hopefully can continue his success on DC and MMM. <font color=yellow>#56 Clement Rouchon and #57 Hendrik Boss</font> were active right near each other, Clement with 26 PRs and a 10 place gain, and Hendrik with 8 PRs and a one place loss. They both cut AF however, and maybe Hendrik will play in order to stay with his new rival. <font color=yellow>#60 Tim van Ham</font> ate his way to 4 PRs, but wasn’t hungry enough to eat away some of his AF points. Maybe next week, as Clement and Hendrik are right around the corner. <font color=yellow>#67 Stacy Needham</font> hit 1 PR and dropped 3 spots, while <font color=yellow>#69 John Brunn</font> hit 10, and moved up one spot. Technically he passed three players, but the charts don’t say it so I can’t write it. A 4-person group of activity jumped in next, with <font color=yellow>#73-76 Emmanuel Amador, Sofie Wimmer, Marvin Donjes, and Nate Paternost</font> all playing. Donjes was active as usual, he could be named Jay Batten Jr., with 17 PRs, but stayed stagnant due to an AF gap. Next up is <font color=yellow>#80 Jon Coppernoll</font>.  J-Cop hit 20 PRs, probably a hoarding group and brought himself up 8 spots. <font color=yellow>#86 Carlos Eduardo</font> hit 10 PRs and escaped from the verge of Top 100 elimination, moving from #97. <font color=yellow>#88 Thibaud Bourdeau</font> hit 9 PRs but dropped 2 spots. Carlos made some quality times and that’s what was the difference. Finally I couldn’t go a news update without mentioning <font color=yellow>#91 Danny Gallenberger</font>, who has risen high above the Top 100 expectations, coming from #94 this week. Although the tables are ever-changing, Danny has to be feeling the cushion behind him growing larger and larger every week. Lastly, <font color=yellow>#94 Andre Hoelscher</font> had his own battle to win, and that was avoiding the 101 and beyond group. He moved from #99 and tried to grab on to Danny’s cushion to no avail.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-373~~</font><br>A lot of activity down here, but I’ll just throw in some honorable mentions since the update has been long, and my head is hurting from looking at this word document. <font color=yellow>#101 Yorick Meeker</font> forged ahead towards Top 100 fame by hitting 28 PRs and moving from #122. About a point separates him from the elite group. <font color=yellow>#121 Jamal Fluellen</font> hit (hoarded) 36 PRs to jump from #137 to a lower spot. And finally <font color=yellow>#123 Loris Bagnasco</font> made a move up 6 places to try and track down Jamal.<br><br>I promise I won’t be as lazy with this section next time, but I figure you want news more than you want every player mentioned.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>A bunch of records were broken from new strats and such, but only the DC 3lap WR changed hands. A huge congratulations goes out to Agustin Berrios, for his first SR. I can’t believe we were actually in the same rivalry at the same time, and I wish him the best luck in the future with moving higher and higher, while I stay in the 150s or something.<br><br><font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'36\"845 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"626</font><br><font color=yellow>Marc Bas </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory lap</font> time of 0'35\"252 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"163</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'21\"854 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'21\"764</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Both </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine lap</font> time of 0'09\"443 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"393</font><br><font color=yellow>Agustin Berrios </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Daisy Circuit crs</font> time of 1'29\"819 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'29\"775</font><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> time of 1'48\"418 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'48\"359</font><br><font color=yellow>Jak Russo </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road crs</font> time of 2'27\"599 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'27\"420</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'13\"124 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'13\"114</font><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium crs</font> time of 1'51\"070 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'50\"470</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>I’m still getting caught up on these since I’ve been busy for the past week. I’ll work on them in the next few days and maybe get in a PM to Meade for a little excerpt in his next week’s update.<br><br>I’m sure there are typos but I’ll leave them unless they’re really drastic.

Starting us off, French Champion <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> did a small amount of PRs but managed to cut well over 1 AF to have a 1.1 AF distance to reclaim it from Shaun. Two places back, the guy who never stops improving, you guessed right, <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten</font> passed up Jimmy Benson this week to become the new Australian Champion. (I understand it shows UK on the PP but I'm pretty sure he is Australian). Anyway, he cut almost an AF with 6 new times this week. Behind him, <font color=yellow>#7 Jimmy Benson</font> didn't lose a lot of ground with the improvements of everyone else, contributing one new time. Let's see if he strikes back next week. Behind Jimmy, <font color=yellow>#8 Tyler McNell</font> makes a nice return and starts to gain lost territory from not playing for a while, jumping from 9th to 8th with a 1.2 AF cut. Finishing us off, German Champion <font color=yellow>#9 Mark Schmidt</font> lost points with people passing him but he still improved 4 times to almost even out what he had already lost. <br><br>Not so much activity into Top 25 but still had 4 people playing this week. Knocking on the door of the Top 10 comes a new challenger, <font color=yellow>#11 Jamie Disley</font>. Upon Jamie's return some weeks ago, he has made a bunch of progress from around Top 30 to #11, this week he contributes 3 new times to put himself 2.5 AF from #10, will he finally get into the Top 10? Some placements back, <font color=yellow>#17 Jak Russo</font> lost some ground but still improved 2 times to set himself up for next week. Making a big jump, <font color=yellow>#18 Salvatore Bellsuci</font> finally breaks into the Top 20, making 10 new PRs and cutting close to 2 AF. Closing this area out, <font color=yellow>#22 Alvin Le</font> gets a little closer to Top 20 with jumping 1 spot to 22nd, making 3 new times and decreases the gap from him and 20th to less than 2 AF.<br><br>It is interesting to look at the stats program at this point for the #26-#50 area. 6 people were active with only 2 people improving 2 times and the rest improving one course, and each person fell back a tiny bit in AF. Anyway, first to be reported in this area is <font color=yellow>#29 Alexandre Gilet</font>, who was one of the only 2 people who improved twice, staying in the same spot as last week. <font color=yellow>#33 Kevin Mason and #34 Zane Royal</font> both improved once, and lost about the same AF, so these guys didn't swap spots at all. 3 places behind Zane, <font color=yellow>#37 Liam Ashcroft</font> was the other person with Alexandre who PRed twice, and keeping his original place from last week. Ending off here, <font color=yellow>#44 Zack McNell and #45 Matthieu Mayer</font> were the last two people who PRed once and kept their original position. Some weeks this area decides to cut a load of places and other weeks they decide to lay off the kart for a while, so I guess this week was just \"one of those weeks\" for this area.<br><br>Instantly, my mind was blown away as I was scrolling down the stats program - scrolling slowly, I saw that #51 to #69 held no activity at all, so I thought that the most active group (generally) of the week had no players at all playing... well this clearly wasn't the case. A good number of 7 people still played in this area this week, from the #70 to #100 area. <font color=yellow>#70 John Brunn</font> lost some ground this week but not that much, as he still managed to improve 2 times this week. Cutting close to 2 AF, <font color=yellow>#73 Emmanuel Amador</font> didn't move any place, but he made a big dent into the gap between him and 72nd down to only 2 from an original 4 AF. <font color=yellow>#75 Sofie Wimmer</font> almost broke even this week with not losing ground but still lost a little bit, but ended up PRing twice this week to have good momentum for next time. Coming along well, <font color=yellow>#76 Marvin Donjes</font> made 4 PRs and continues his consistent progress up the ranks this week. Into the 80s now, <font color=yellow>#83 Carlos Eduardo</font> made a nice 3 place cut this week, making a nice round of 7 PRs and cut close to 3 AF. <font color=yellow>#89 Danny Gallenberger</font> continued the trend as well, making his own jump of 2 places into the Top 90 and cut a little over 2 AF with 5 new times. The last improvement here, making a leap of faith into the Top 100 comes <font color=yellow>#93 Yorick Meeker</font>. Yorick went from 101th to 93rd this week with an impressive 7+ AF cut with 8 new times, congrats.<br><br>Quieter than usual, 6 people still picked up their controller this week in \"The Field\". Inching closer and closer to the Top 100, <font color=yellow>#112 Noah Gordon</font> starts us off with close to a 2 AF cut with 6 new times, bumping himself up 2 places. 4 places back, we have <font color=yellow>#116 Viktor Silivanov</font> who jumped 4 places this week to get closer to the Top 100 like Noah. He improved 6 new times and cut over 3 AF to finish off this week. Coming to the biggest cut of this week with an insane cut, <font color=yellow>#121 Simon Uldry</font> improved way over half his times sheet, cutting 37 places and 46+ AF, great job. <font color=yellow>#124 Dexter Howe</font> did some magic this week with a 1+ AF cut with only 1 PR, jumping 3 places from last week. Affected by the jump of the Mighty Simon, <font color=yellow>#135 Sam Smith</font> got bumped back a spot this week but still gained positive AF points for 2 new times this week. Finishing this weeks update, <font color=yellow>#153 Nicholas Harvey</font> makes a pleasant return to MKW this week and starts his come back well with 4 new times and a 1+ AF cut.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>No new Site Records this week...<br><br>That's it for me. See you guys around.</b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Don’t worry everyone, I was really tired last night from my workout so I couldn’t get the news up. It’s up today though, and that’s better than skipping a whole week, right? Anyway, here’s the news from 3/13 - 3/19.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>One newbie, which has become the norm.

The huge surge of WRs in the past few weeks has slowed a bit, however many still wanted to advance in the charts. We’re nearing 400 players, so a spot in the Top 200 which once was laughable is becoming more and more impressive. Keep up the work guys!<br><br>The only “Welcome to the AF chart” goes out to <font color=yellow>#251 Sean Wilson</font>, who hit 12 PRs (not sure how many were new or old) to jump in at a decent starting ground. Now is the real challenge, as every time submitted can change his score. Will Sean work to gain ground, or go inactive and slowly drop? Only time will tell.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Proportionately, the Top 10 was the most active group this week, with a nice 70% turnout from the elite MKW karters. <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> is still on the great quest to reclaim his title, and each week that Jorge stays dormant it seems like a glaring possibility. We do know JG has some hoarded times, but with his 2 PRs and small .6% cut this week, Meade is about half a point of AF away from retaking the site crown, or 32 place improvements. <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> has found out that he had a lot more left in the tank, as this week he sends in 3 PRs, trying to fight off <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font>. Both have battled back and forth but Tanney is holding on strong to his position. Marc sent in a PR to stay active and show STanney he’s not giving up the fight yet. Passing Ex-Champ Bubbles who remains retired, we find a karter who seems that they’ll never retire. <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten</font> had a “quiet” week, only hitting 7 PRs for a 1AF cut, or a 3.5% improvement. 8 huge AF points lie between Jay and the Top 5. If he keeps up his progress, he should be there in a few months. Jay distanced himself from <font color=yellow>#7 Jimmy Benson</font>, who PRed 4 times this week. Due to Jay’s PRs he ended up gaining AF, but much less than the inactives around him. Lastly is <font color=yellow>#9 Mark Schmidt</font>. Mark hit 1 PR to try and widen the gap for the German crown from Dustin Enders (now at 4 AF). Dustin seems to submit in hoarding spurts however, so Mark may need to keep working.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Jamie Disley</font> continued his progress in a comeback, dropping 2 AF points and now sitting only a tenth away from the fabled Top 10. I can’t ever remember Jamie being in this illustrious group despite his wide range of great PRs, so this should be a great accomplishment in his already impressive MKW career. <font color=yellow>#12 Alex Shoal</font> has fallen out of the Top 10 but is never forgotten as a great karter, holding that spot for years. He dropped by to send in 3 PRs this week, one on Mario Circuit where he’s been working on his strategy, which helped him to drop 1.1 AF points and fend of the other attackers to his position. Next up is newcomer to the full AF chart (as of a month ago) <font color=yellow>#14 Jak Russo</font>. Jak jumped up three spots with 5 PRs, cutting off 2 AF points, and now sits ready to strike on #13 Ben Hart, and Shoal if they aren’t careful.  <font color=yellow>#18 Salvatore Bellusci</font> has been making strides in the charts recently, but had a quiet week. He had a nice 3 PRs, but it wasn’t enough to stop the inevitable AF gain from more active players. <font color=yellow>#22 Alvin Le</font>, Swiss MKW champion had a decent week, PRing twice but still gaining a bit of AF. Finally, a new entry to this group comes with <font color=yellow>#24 Alexandre Gilet</font>, who jumped all the way from #29 to just barely squeak in. He had 8 PRs which cut 6 AF, so they must have been amazing PRs in order to provoke such a jump. On the short end of the stick this week is Marvin Rekovsky, who falls back to #26 and will need to fight to be mentioned in this paragraph. Wait a minute, nevermind.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#29 Oliver Martin</font> always seems to start out this section, and this week was no different. He had a 1 PR week, and the jump from Alexandre pushed him back a spot. The lack of anyone really active around him helps though, and the Top 25 beckons. <font color=yellow>#36 Liam Ashcroft and #37 Thomas van Deerse</font> decided to kart together this week. They swapped spots however, Liam’s 7 PRs ousting Thomas’s 3, and each cut a little AF. Liam seems to have the edge now, and Thomas will have to play catch up to reclaim his spot. Ending off this quiet group is <font color=yellow>#44 Zack McNell</font>, who had 1 PR but fell back due to the more active players. Will he catch Tyler near the top? It seems far off, but a Jay Batten-esque move could do it.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#51 Agustin Berrios</font> is inches away from moving into the Top 50. He  jumped up two spots from #53 due to other activity, and now stands 1.3 AF points away from passing Ex-Champ Tim Shelbourne for a Top 50 position. With his recent SR progress, hopefully Nick can write about it next week. Farther down is <font color=yellow>#67 John Brunn</font>, who made a nice move from #70 up three spots. He’s always been hovering around this spot, and with a few good weeks (due to a lack of activity here), he could see himself moving up quite a bit. <font color=yellow>#73 Emmanuel Amador</font> held his ground with 4 PRs, cutting a few tenths off, while <font color=yellow>#75 Marvin Donjes</font> continued his constant surge up the charts. 9 PRs this week helped him cut 3 AF points and continue to bridge a 5 point AF gap. Next week with the same result he should latch on to another group of karters. <font color=yellow>#89 Danny Gallenberger</font> has risen above the 90’s and now secured himself a spot in the Top 100 MKW players. He hit 6 PRs to drop .7 AF, but again this group is very quiet, and merely cutting AF causes you to jump places. Finally, <font color=yellow>#92 Yorick Meeker</font> banged out 13 PRs, causing him to cut 6 AF, but due to huge gaps only move up one place. <br><br><font color=red>~~101-Wherever~~</font><br>For once the 101 and after group was very active this week. <font color=yellow>#105 Frederick Hutchington</font> hit 17 PRs, bumping him up all the way from #113 up 8 spots. He’s 10 AF away from the Top 100, so continued progress is very important for him to reach that goal. Also active were <font color=yellow>#110 Simon Uldry and #114 Noah Gordon</font>. Simon moved from #121 up 11 spots, while Noah cut .87 AF but lost two spots due to Frederick and Simon. <font color=yellow>#122 Dexter Howe</font> had two impressive PRs that moved him up two spots. <font color=yellow>#135 Brett Edwards</font> hit 5 PRs to cut 3.5 AF and move up a spot, but still needs to continue progress if he wants the Top 100. Other active names included Christian Wild and Nicholas Harvey, but no one really had any form of cut otherwise. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Only 2 records this week, but one holds extra significance.<br><font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 1'57\"480 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'57\"374</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square lap</font> time of 0'38\"997 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"990</font><br><br>With Alex’s improvement, the first true king of MKW, Alvin van Asselt is bumped off the records table. Sword loses a SR and returns to 3 from 4, however both Shoal and Tanney go from a solo record to having two under the belt. The top of the chart remains unchanged, with ROM at 8, JG at 7, and Meade at 6.<br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Sorry I couldn’t finish with awards, I did about a month’s worth of them, however I figured you’d want the whole news up rather than the awards. I’ll finish them in a few days and send a supplement to be added into Meade’s update. I think you’d want all the awards as opposed to a few in the news at once, and some have already been updated, so just check the Awards page.<br><br>Also, before I forget the POQ is quickly coming up, and as you guys have stated you’re interested in voting for the POQ’s, I’ll have a poll put up a few days after this news update. I’ll let you know all of the stats so you’re not in the dark. <br><br>Peace and keep on Karting!<br>-Web<br></p>",

        "content": "<p><b> I guess you can consider this the start of the 2nd quarter of 2011, so let's see how the first week rolled out.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Three new people joined the site this week... welcome to <font color=lime>Yann Deptia, Hato Mugi, Thomas Petraud</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>We finally broke the 40 player/week active barrier again as opposed to recent weeks with 41 players playing with some pretty nice jumps.<br><br>A very good deal of activity was in the Top 10 this week with 8 out of 10 players active (not really typical to see). At the top, <font color=yellow>#1 Nick Meade</font> took advantage of the very slim gap at the end of the week to play a bit and made 5 PRs, gaining the Site Champion status from #2 Jorge Hernandez who hasn't played for some weeks. Keeping really consistent activity since his come back at the turn of the new year, UK Champion <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> improved 17 of his times for a huge cut of over 2 AF, effectively gapping himself from Marco for now. The French Champion <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> didn't let that affect him though, as he too made a very big cut with 8 new PRs and cut 1.5 AF to keep the distance ~1 AF from Shaun. This very interesting rivalry between Shaun and Marco in recent weeks has been very fun to see, it's almost like a tug of war game really. Anyway, now we arrive to <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten</font> who is (confirmed) as a British player (sorry about my last update Jay). He capitalized big this week when he improved 12 times on his times sheet to cut off another chunk of the gap from him and #5 David McPartland. Trying to gain some ground back to regain 6th, Australian Champion <font color=yellow>#7 Jimmy Benson</font> lost more than half an AF due to heavy activity in the Top but still had time to make 2 new times to have the distance to Jay just barely above 2 AF now. Now that I see it, along with Jimmy, <font color=yellow>#8 Tyler McNell, German Champion #9 Mark Schmidt, and #10 Jamie Disley</font> all lost a little more than half an AF this week due to heavy activity from the Top and from lower placements, but they all contributed 4, 2, and 3 new times, respectively. <br><br>A nice amount of activity came from the Top 25 too, with 6 people trying to advance into the Top 10/20. Having really quick progress (reminds me of Jay in past weeks), <font color=yellow>#12 Jak Russo</font> made a big cut of his own, with cutting close to 3 AF with 8 new times and jumped from 15th to 12th, very close to the Top 10 now. Behind him, Canadian Champion <font color=yellow>#13 Alex Shoal</font> was unfortunate with the heavy activity losing a little over an AF worth of points, but he still made one time, so maybe he will play next week. The Spanish Champion <font color=yellow>#14 Tony Ruiz</font> had a similiar week to Alex as well, with losing a little more than half an AF but still improved 3 times to set himself up for next week. <font color=yellow>#18 Salvatore Bellusci</font> made 4 new times but was still set back close to an AF point. Eager to join the Top 20 again, <font color=yellow>#21 Alvin Le</font> lost some AF like the majority of people but still ended up making 3 new times to be only .5 AF from passing Cole to rejoin the Top 20 group. Finishing this area up, <font color=yellow>#23 Alexandre Gilet</font> seemed to break the chain by making 3 PRs and lost around .1 AF, he didn't break the chain with that, he broke the chain with actually gaining a spot to #23 from #24 even though he lost AF, if that makes any sense.<br><br>Maybe the most active group this week was the Top 50 territory with 10 people active, with some pretty nice jumps involved too. <font color=yellow>#26 Fabien Jacques</font> lost less than .1 AF this week (might even be 1 or 2 places actually), but he still made 2 new PRs and is roughly .2 AF from passing #25 Daniel Anderson to join the Top 25 group again. Not too far behind Fabien, <font color=yellow>#29 Oliver Martin</font> made 2 PRs too and lost close to the same amount of ground, but both still have a lot left they can do in coming weeks. A little farther back, both <font color=yellow>#34 Zane Royal and #35 Liam Ashcroft</font> lost over 1 AF but still made 1 and 2 new times, respectively. Two places back,  <font color=yellow>#37 Thomas van Deerse</font> made 3 new times and kept his place for the most part without much placement lost. Coming up very fast is <font color=yellow>#38 Matthieu Mayer</font> behind Thomas, who improved 15 times this week good to jump himself 4 placements and almost 6 AF, nice going. Making a mighty leap himself behind Matthieu, <font color=yellow>#39 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> made 15 PRs as well, jumping 4 places like Matthieu, and cut over 3 AF, good work to you as well. Several places back, <font color=yellow>#44 Kyle R</font>, the person whom we don't know his surname, improved 2 times this week to edge a little closer to the Top 40. Behind Kyle, <font color=yellow>#45 Andrew Tran</font> submitted a majority of hoarded times as well as several new times that pushed him up 60 places, cutting around 72 AF and improving close to 75% of his times sheet, definitely a new force to be reckoned with in coming weeks. Closing out, <font color=yellow>#47 Zack McNell</font> lose a placement to Andy but still improved 2 times this week.<br><br>Man what happened to my Top 100 area this week? Normally this brings the most amount of activity next to \"The Field\"; only 4 people played this week. Not wasting this opportunity, <font color=yellow>#62 John Brunn</font> does some very good work this week jumping 4 places with 7 new times and cut a little over 2 AF, coming near the Top 60 now. 6 places back, the persistent tank <font color=yellow>#68 Marvin Donjes</font> continues very high improvements with PRing almost half his times sheet, jumping 7 places and almost 10 AF. <font color=yellow>#75 Emmanuel Amador</font> lost 2 places due to activity from John and Marvin most likely but he still improved 2 times to make it a little less. Finishing up, <font color=yellow>#89 Danny Gallenberger</font> made a dent at the gap from the beginning of the Top 90, making 7 new PRs with a little over 1 AF cut to finish off this area.<br><br>To \"The Field\", this held the last 6 people who played this week. <font color=yellow>#105 Simon Uldry</font> cut a little over 3 AF himself with 7 new times and edged closer towards the Top 100 this past week. Getting close to Simon this week was both <font color=yellow>#109 Dave Tandy and #110 Noah Gordon</font>, where Dave made 5 new PRs to stretch a little closer to the Top 100 but Noah wanted in on the action as well so he answered with 4 new PRs, jumping him right behind Dave from #114 with a near 2 AF cut, future rivalry? Into the 200 and beyond, <font color=yellow>#209 Tony Fan</font> recently changed from Kart to Bike and quickly began piling on PR after PR and managed to cut 18 placements with about 40% of his sheet improved cutting 28 AF, great job. To conclude the news, both <font color=yellow>#291 Julian Stephens and #292 Andre Riviere</font> were both active with 4 and 13 new times, respectively.   <br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>A good amount of Site Record activity with 3 new SRs:<br><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium crs</font> time of 1'50\"470 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'50\"446</font><br><font color=yellow>Hato Mugi </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Mario Circuit lap</font> time of 0'28\"817 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'28\"742</font><br><font color=yellow>Brett Edwards </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens lap</font> time of 0'38\"573 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"558</font><br><br>Keep watching to see new rivalries begin and continue during this quarter...</b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Welcome back to the newsroom MKW community, it’s been a while but with random technical difficulties and such the news has been delayed. I’m back to inform you on what should have been April 3rd, however it’s 14 days later. So place your mind back two weeks ago at a time when, well whatever happened in the past two weeks didn’t happen, and enjoy this delayed news update. This update covers from March 28 to April 2, 2011. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Two new players this week, which is a little better than the usual one.<br><font color=lime> Munim Peerally</font> shocked the world by actually completing a full timesheet and popping in the AF charts at #249 on his first submission, something that rarely happens. With a decent starting spot, only improvement can come from here. <br><font color=lime> Riley King</font> submitted the 32 times that I think most players get confused as a full timesheet, which would put him at 244th if the rest were dead last, which hopefully they won’t be. A nice starting set which isn’t actually a full timeset.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>44 Players were active this week, two of which you’ve already heard about, and a majority of which you’ll hear about now. I just don’t worry about those non-full timesheeters, since nobody can really see their overall standing anyway. <br>The “Welcome to the AF chart” section is blank this week, since no one but Munim completed their timesheet. Everyone in incomplete timesheet land wanted to stay there, but with several very impressive karters only several submissions away from a Top 100 placing, maybe a sudden moment of action will shake up the standings. Both Sebastian Kovats and Sean Owens submitted more times to fill out their timesheet and get closer to the fabled 64 near the top of the list, but neither finished it off. Hopefully next week someone will break the trend. <br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>After a four day reign with the crown, Nick Meade succumbed to the pressure of <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font>, who returns with a bunch of hoarded times to reclaim some SRs, and more importantly the #1 overall spot.  Jorge sent in 8 PRs to cut a full point of AF, propelling him to a .9 AF point lead over Meade. Nick wasn’t active this week so that added to the gap, but right below him <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> was still playing to close the large gap between #2 and #3. Tanney hit 5 PRs to drop .2 points off his AF, and now has (only?) 3.7 AF to go before he catches Meade for #2 to reclaim his old peak position on the charts. <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> cut exactly the same amount of AF that Tanney did with .2344, submitting 4 PRs of his own. The gap here is still about 1.3 AF points, so Marc will need to work overtime since Tanney is so active. Passing over the retired bubbles, we come to <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten</font>. Active as always, Jay sent in 12 PRs to drop 1.2 AF points, which is ridiculous at this level. He’s now only 5.1 AF away from Bubbles, and I say only because it should take him a few weeks if he keeps up the activity level. <font color=yellow>#7 Jimmy Benson</font> sent in 1 PR but it wasn’t enough to keep him even, and he lost a few tenths. <font color=yellow>#8 Tyler McNell</font> sent in two PRs and cut one place, or .0156 AF points. <font color=yellow>#9 Mark Schmidt</font> could make a run for this position if he has a nice week, as he is only .8 AF away. This week however he only sent in one PR and it didn’t cut him any AF points. At the bottom of this very active group, newcomer to the Top 10 Jamie Disley stayed quiet, but with the increasing activity below he might want to pick up the controller soon.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Jak Russo</font>, who was just entering the charts a month or so ago is now fighting for the Top 10. After this week, he passed Dustin Enders, the King of Hoarding, to lie in wait within .4 points of the Top 10. Jamie’s comeback has brought him into the fabled group, but if Jak continues at his pace and Jamie stays quiet, the switch will surely happen. A little lower, <font color=yellow>#14 Tony Ruiz</font> hit 6 PRs to drop half of and AF point, but currently is wandering around in an AF graveyard, so he’ll have to keep playing to escape. <font color=yellow>#18 Salvatore Bellusci and #19 Alvin Le</font> were both active as always, hitting 4 and 2 PRs respectively. Alvin however had a massive 1.4 AF cut passing James Richards, and is now .4 AF away from passing Salvatore, who only cut .28 AF this week. <font color=yellow>#22 Alexandre Gilet</font> passed Mick this week with 6 PRs. His 1.4 AF cut puts him at the gate of a small AF graveyard of about 2 points. Finally, <font color=yellow>#25 Fabien Jacques</font>, aka MT Flap King, sent in 2 PRs (maybe MT 3lap and flap?) to cut .07AF and hold his ground from the coming attackers. <br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>As always, this group didn’t have a massive range of activity, but the people that did play had massive improvements. <font color=yellow>#28 Matthieu Mayer</font> continued his rise to the top of the charts, jumping four places from #32 with a 3.56AF cut. One of the victims was <font color=yellow>#30 Andrew Tran</font>, who lost a spot but did send in one PR to lessen the damage. <font color=yellow>#31 Kevin Mason and #33 Liam Ashcroft</font> moved together to finish one place apart. No that’s not a typo, Kevin’s 5 PRs and 2.8 AF cut were enough to tie him exactly with #31 Oliver Martin. Lash had a much better week with 9 PRs and a 3.7AF cut, he’s sitting .3 away from the #31 duo. A little lower down, <font color=yellow>#37 Zane Royal</font> hit 3 PRs but none were of huge significance, as he still lost .2AF. <font color=yellow>#38 Thomas van Deerse</font> was on the move, with a 2.1 AF cut and 4 PRs he jumped over Joe Sebeny to sit behind Zane in wait. To close out the group, <font color=yellow>#46 Zack McNell</font> continues his quest to catch his brother with 2 PRs and a one spot gain over Franco Gubser.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>This group can only be described as “few and far between”, as almost no one played as usual. It has to be that feeling of only having two numbers in your position that gets you on a lazy streak. <font color=yellow>#56 John Brunn</font> takes advantage of the laziness, and moves up all the way from #61 with only 5 PRs. That’s efficiency. <font color=yellow>#59 Tim van Ham</font> makes a similar move, rising from #63 to #59 with only 6 PRs. Take an example from these two, MK community. Once you make it through the golden gates to the Top 100, everything becomes a little easier. <font color=yellow>#68 Marvin Donjes</font> had a slow week, hitting only 5 PRs. He’s stuck in a huge gap of AF, so he’ll need to summon his past self to grab one of those 35 PR weeks again. <font color=yellow>#71 Yann Deptia</font>made his sophomore week a good one, cutting about 1 point of AF with 3 PRs, and advancing a spot from #72. Much farther down we come to <font color=yellow>#83 Danny Gallenberger</font>, who I’m happy to report has secured himself in the Top 100 for a while. He jumped from #87 with 12 PRs, and with a few more tenths can jump past a couple more karters. <font color=yellow>#92 Emmanuel Debenest</font> saw the gates nearing his vision and the 101-110 group looking for blood, so he accelerated away from his 96th position to feel a little safer. He had a massive 8 point AF cut with 9 PRs. Finally, <font color=yellow>#100 Frederick Hutchington</font> has his long journey pay off, as he moves the final four spots to the fabled group, displacing Bernando de Jans (or that guy who made that massive 64/64 hoarding submission and cut 100AF last summer). He’s in a very unsafe position right now, so only time will tell if he can hold his ground. <br><br><font color=red>~~101-Fin ~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#105 Simon Uldry</font> cuts almost 2 AF and moves up a place, spurred on by 5 PRs. Close behind are <font color=yellow>#108 Noah Gordon and #109 Dave Tandy</font>, who both are looking at Frederick with fire in their eyes. Noah cut a point of AF with 1 PR, and Dave jumped Michael Schneider with 9 PRs and a 3.5AF cut. Both are so close to that Top 100 goal, but so far away. While you’re wrapping your mind around that last sentence, check out <font color=yellow>#113 Viktor Silvanov</font>, who jumped 6 spots from #119 with 9PRs and a 5.3AF cut. He passed <font color=yellow>#116 Christian Nemetz</font>, who was once in the Top 100 (how harsh the times have been). Christian played for one PR but it lost him AF due to great activity above. <font color=yellow>#119 Loris Bagnasco</font> filled Viktor’s empty void with a move from #127. 16 PRs came along for the ride, and due to their weight 6.1 AF points had to be left for other travellers to pick up. <font color=yellow>#124 Dexter Howe</font> hit a PR that didn’t gain him ground but kept him from losing as much. <font color=yellow>#141 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> had a similar story, 2 PRs not putting him above even. <font color=yellow>#202 Tony Fan</font> karted his way to one PR, and <font color=yellow>#286 Andre Riviere and #288 Julian Stephens</font> both began long climbs to the top near the bottom of the charts to close out the activity for this week. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>A very nice amount of records this week, several spurred on by Jorge’s hoarding submission/return. Jorge now has 9 SRs, which propel him past ROM on the leaderboard, and send Meade back to 4 and a tie with Marc for 3rd.

        "content": "<p><b> Getting back on track with updates, here is the week of 3 April -> 10 April. Yeah it is a full week because of some difficulty with the stats program for the 9th, so this includes an extra day, making the next news update 1 day shorter. After that it will be the same Sunday to Saturday content in news.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Four new people to add to the AF roster this week, welcome to... <font color=lime>Jason Collis, Stephen De Winter, Eric Shore, Aziz Abdullah</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font>  <br><br>41 people were active in this (7) day news update. <br><br>8 of the 10 players of the Top 10 were active this week with some pretty interesting activity, including a new AF player that slotted some people down a spot. Directly at the top, improving times to no avail, reigning champ <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font> improved 11 more of his times, and reached new limits by cutting nearly 1 whole AF, which made him the first player since Alvin way long ago to be under the 5 AF mark. With these new times also, he became the first Myth player of MKW, quite the accomplishment. United States Champion <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> couldn't really do much to stop Jorge, only making 2 small PRs and lost some AF. Becoming a serious contender for #2 or even #1, UK Champion <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> continues his monstrous activity with 11 new times, cutting almost an AF and settling at mid 9 AF. If he continues weeks progress like this, for sure he could be the Site Champion soon. The French Champion <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> shouldn't be counted out though, he cut close to half an AF with 4 new times and is still making steady progress behind Shaun, showing he is still around and fighting. Behind him, new AF player but long time member of the players' page <font color=yellow>#5 Aziz Abdullah</font> slotted 5th, finally submitting all his flaps, albeit if a lot of them are 1 shroomers. He made 7 new times this week (generally the flaps) and rests at almost the 20 AF mark. Two places behind him we have <font color=yellow>#7 Jay Batten</font> who lost some ground from the high activity around this area but still improved 9 of his times to nearly even off what he lost. Even though he was pushed back a spot, <font color=yellow>#9 Tyler McNell</font> still cut positive AF with 2 new times trying to catch Jimmy for #8. Finishing off comes <font color=yellow>#10 Jak Russo</font>, who made an impressive 2+ AF cut with only 5 PRs, coming really close to the small gap between him, Tyler, and Jimmy. <br><br>Top 25 wasn't really all that active with only 4 people playing. German Champ <font color=yellow>#11 Mark Schmidt</font> was an unfortunate victim who got slotted back 2 spots and lost some ground but still made a single new time. A few places back, the Spanish Champ <font color=yellow>#15 Tony Ruiz</font> cut close to half an AF with 3 new PRs. Around maybe 20 places or so separate him from getting to #13, if he makes an extra push, he will most likely get that and more. Both <font color=yellow>#18 Alvin Le and #19 Salvatore Bellusci</font> made 1 new time as well, but they both lost some ground. Apart from that, this area was quiet.<br><br>People began playing again as we hit Top 50 here. 8 people picked up their controllers and tried to move up the charts. Making great progress deeper into the 20s, <font color=yellow>#28 Thomas van Deerse</font> made 12 new PRs and cut nearly 4 AF and put himself a place better than last week. If he improves by just 1.5 AF or so, he could jump 3-5 spots too, so keep playing! Very close to Thomas, a new comer to the Top 30 is <font color=yellow>#30 Lucas Acek</font>, who jumped a mighty 7 places from #37 to join the ranks of the Top 30, cutting over 6 AF with 10 new times. <font color=yellow>#33 Kevin Mason</font> cut close to half an AF with 1 PR to keep some activity alive as well. <font color=yellow>#35 Liam Ashcroft</font> was an unfortunate victim like some others, improving 1 time but still losing some ground. <font color=yellow>#44 Kyle R</font> had a similar week as well, doing 1 better with 2 new times but still losing ground and a placement. 4 places back, <font color=yellow>#48 Zack McNell</font> was like Kyle and Liam, with a new time but still losing ground. We finish with positive numbers though, as <font color=yellow>#49 John Brunn</font> digs a deeper dent in the Top 50 with nearly a 3 AF cut with 5 new times, and <font color=yellow>#50 Matthias Sempels</font> joins the ranks of the Top 50 by jumping up a spot with 11 new times and over a 2 AF cut.<br><br>The Top 100 was virtually dead this week with only 5 people playing, this could only mean \"The Field\" had the most people active. Anyways, starting us off, <font color=yellow>#54 Tim van Ham</font> cut almost 2 AF with 3 new times and only a few AF separate him from the Top 50 now. 11 places back, <font color=yellow>#65 Marvin Donjes</font> continues consistent progress through the weeks with close to 2 AF cut this week and 6 new times, jumping up 1 placement. Both <font color=yellow>#72 Stacy Needham and #83 Danny Gallenberger</font> lost around the same ground but still submitted 1 new time to finish off the week. The last player was a new face to the Top 100, completing a goal he set for this year in only the first 4 months of the year. <font color=yellow>#98 Noah Gordon</font> cut over 8 AF with 14 new times and jumped 9 placements to join the Top 100, congrats Noah.<br><br>\"The Field\" had 9 people playing this week (thought it was more before I counted the actual people who made cuts) but is still the most active group of this week nonetheless. <font color=yellow>#103 Simon Uldry</font> is very close to the Top 100 now, cutting 2 spots and making 4 new times, just that extra push will propel him there I am sure. <font color=yellow>#111 Viktor Silivanov</font> cut a nice 3 placements with almost 3 AF cut and 6 new PRs to boot. An interesting situation, <font color=yellow>#114 Christian Nemetz</font> got a good slice of luck this week with losing AF but still submitted 1 time, but still ended up finishing a spot higher this week. If only it was that higher in the top ranks. Anyway, <font color=yellow>#119 Jamal Fluellen</font> comes for more this week with almost 2 AF cut with 3 new times, jumping 2 spots. <font color=yellow>#123 Dexter Howe</font> almost mirrored Jamal, with 2 PRs and the same cuts as he did. Coming back from well over a year of inactivity, we see brother of Shaun <font color=yellow>#132 Paul Tanney</font> make a nice 2 place advancement with 6 new times and almost 3 AF cut, nice to see you again Paul. <font color=yellow>#136 Brett Edwards</font> pitched in on activity with 1 new time, but lost a place. Finishing off, both <font color=yellow>#272 Julian Stephens and #286 Andre Riviere</font> made respectable cuts of 8-14 PRs and nice placement jumps.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>Not much Site Record activity to note compared to other weeks, only two were broken:<br><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Daisy Circuit lap</font> time of 0'28\"448 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'28\"374</font><br><font color=yellow>Marc Bas </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 crs</font> time of 0'53\"145 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'52\"674</font><br><br>Zack should have \"last\" weeks news up tomorrow, then I will be back at the end of this week for this weeks news (man that confused me). Sorry for the delays of news, but everything should be all good now. See you around.</b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Before you start reading this entry, read the two below. That is, if you wanted to see the old news you missed out on. Instead of lumping everything together we decided to split it up into 3 one-week entries, and this one covers April 11th through the 16th. Yeah yeah I know that’s only 6 days, but because of server problems Meade’s was through the 10th since the 9th was corrupted. You probably should have read that before complaining hmm? Just kidding, anyway let’s get on to the important stuff. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>One new player this week.<br><br><font color=lime> Bryan Straatman</font> submitted two times. Not really sure what they were and why he decided to start out with so little, but he did. His position is somewhere in the 300s, but that doesn’t really matter since the other 62 times will drastically change his standing. <br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>31 Players were active this week, a lot less than my last update and a little less than Nick’s. I’m really bored for some reason, so today I’m going to switch it up and go from bottom to top. Not really sure if Shadow ever did this in his old updates, but oh well, if he did maybe you guys were just aching to have a second version. <br><br>But wait! The “Welcome to the AF chart” needs to be recognized! Actually, nobody new joined the AF charts this week either from joining straight with 64 times or slowly fighting their way on to the ranks. Now it’s on to the news.  <br><br><font color=red>~~381-101 ~~</font><br>Starting at the very bottom, it’s hard to tell who actually improved by just looking at AF count, since there was a player deletion who had 13 times, causing a bunch of people to gain AF. However, looking at the number of PRs column, it becomes obvious.  <font color=yellow>#271 Julian Stephens</font> was the lowest ranked player to PR this week, sending in two of his improvements to hurdle Moritz with a 2.5 point AF cut. A little further up, we reach recent newcomer <font color=yellow>#233 Munim Peerally</font>, who was quick to start his upward battle. Munim sent in 6 PRs this week for a 8.1 point AF cut and a 9 place move. If this keeps up, the Top 200 will be within his sights in no time.  Next up is <font color=yellow>#206 Dimitri Coueffe</font>, submitting 11 PRs giving him a 4.7 AF loss. The nice cut was only enough to move him up one spot, however I’m sure he can improve in the future. Next we reach <font color=yellow>#148 Tom Norton</font>, who really shouldn’t be ranked this low but is due to not having a “full” timesheet. Sword submitted 7 PRs, three of which were site records, to cut 2.5 AF points and move up three spots back into the Top 150. Can’t wait until we see what Sword’s true potential is. Just barely above him is secret agent <font color=yellow>#146 Polar King</font> too important to the mission to disclose his real name. King cut 2 AF points but due to low activity around him stayed exactly in position at #146. <font color=yellow>#135 1:59.945</font> aka Brett Edwards sent in one PR which cut him .6 AF compared to his inactive surroundings, however couldn’t move up a spot. The entire Tanney household is getting back into the MKW scene, with <font color=yellow>#122 Paul Tanney</font> submitting 11 PRs to attempt to catch his younger brother. He did vault 10 spots up with an 8.7 AF cut, however the road is long and dangerous to #3. <font color=yellow>#118 Dexter Howe</font> has fought his way back in to the 110s for which he was known months ago this week. Moving from #122, Dexter Owned 5 PRs and cut 1.98 AF points, not that Much but maybe in future weeks he can improve more. To close out this highly active group, <font color=yellow>#103 Simon Uldry</font> sent in one PR that made up the difference of his loss this week, keeping exactly the same AF as 7 days ago. <br><br><font color=red>~~100-51~~</font><br>Two weeks ago (okay, three days but meh) I mentioned <font color=yellow>#99 Frederick Hutchington </font> cruising into the top 100 in style from #104. He slowed down a little bit due to celebrating and fell out again. However this week he fought back in, coming from #102 with with a 2 point AF cut and 2 solid PRs. Ahead of him is <font color=yellow>#98 Noah Gordon</font>, fresh into the two-digit crowd. Cutz only had one PR this time around and didn’t cut any more AF, but he held of Frederick so that’s a plus for this week. Then follows a huge group of people who are either dead, asleep, or just not karting (I’m going to guess it’s the third one). We have to move all the way up to <font color=yellow>#65 Marvin Donjes</font>  in order to find the next active karter. With 2 PRs this week, Donjes cut about .15AF points or 10 spots in order to slowly move up against the silent crowd. Slightly above is <font color=yellow>#51 Tim van Ham</font>, within reaching distance of the Top 50. He moved up three spots with three PRs, in total losing 1.2 AF points, and is about 2.2 from catching #50 Matthias Sempels to earn his ticket to move up a class.<br><br><font color=red>~~50-26~~</font><br>The activity here was scattered as usual in this group, however several had decent cuts. <font color=yellow>#49 Zack McNell</font> fought valiantly to keep his spot, but with only one PR fell victim to <font color=yellow>#48 John Brunn</font>.  John hit 4 PRs to cut about 1AF points, and has a very nice set of four players less than 1AF away from him to look at with hunger in his eyes. <font color=yellow>#39 Zane Royal</font> had a 2 PR effort that earned him .3AF points which is about half of a percent. <font color=yellow>#35 Liam Ashcroft</font> is another one of those guys that is steadily gaining every week without really being seen, so I will expose him this week. He hit 2 PRs and moved up a spot in order to secure my suspicions. <font color=yellow>#33 Kevin Mason</font> did the same, 2PRs for a one spot gain. I’m keeping watch to see if Kevin and Liam are working together to sabotage other player’s positions. Finally, <font color=yellow>#26 Fabien Jacques</font> sent in one improvement, but it wasn’t enough to help him lose AF points. <br><br><font color=red>~~25-11~~</font><br>Only three karters active here, as everyone else is apparently fine with their current standing. <font color=yellow>#25 Thomas van Deerse</font> had a 2 PR effort that pushed him up three spots, displacing Fabien and stamping his seal on the Top 25. <font color=yellow>#20 Salvatore Bellusci</font> sent in one PR to shave off a bit of AF, but not enough to move him around anywhere. Finally, <font color=yellow>#18 Alvin Le</font> moved up one spot from #19 with 3 PRs, cutting him 1.8AF points. With newcomers popping in here and above, karters who once thought they were in safe positions are now dropping like rocks. (See #15 Alex Shoal, in the Top 10 only months ago, etc.)<br><br><font color=red>~~10-1~~</font><br>Four karters were playing in this elite section, as newcomers strove to displace veterans. <font color=yellow>#9 Jak Russo</font> sent in 5 PRs and cut .76AF, but he was knocked back a spot by a huge spurt of PRs from <font color=yellow>#8 Jimmy Benson</font>. Jimmy had 9 PRs for 3.76AF, fighting back against both Jak and Jay who have been fighting in place. <font color=yellow>#7 Jay Batten</font> however, has passed Jimmy by several points and is now marching towards ex-champ #6 David McPartland. This week, he had 9 PRs, for a 1.85 AF cut, and is now within 2 points of passing Bubbles and setting Doom on his radar. To end off the week, <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> had three PRs, for a tenth of a point cut, and continues to close the gap between NMeade and his kart. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Sword shook up the SR table this week, gaining three. He jumped up to a tie for third place with Marc Bas (5SRs), after Marc grabbed one SR of his own. Both ROM and JG suffered hits to their impressive tallies, and now have “only” 9 and 7 respectively. Newcomer Jak Russo also took a hit, dropping from 2 to 1 SRs. <br><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 1'57\"296 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'57\"251</font><br><font color=yellow>Marc Bas </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 crs</font> time of 0'52\"674 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'52\"518</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach crs</font> time of 1'22\"167 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'22\"074</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach lap</font> time of 0'25\"274 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'25\"247</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>1st POQ, 2011 - <font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney</font>, for his massive comeback and race up the Top 10 ranking.<br>1st April POW - <font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney </font>, for 11 PRs while already being ranked third, and almost a full point of AF cut. <br>2nd April POW - <font color=yellow>Jimmy Benson</font>, for fighting off some newcomers to the Top 10 while hitting 9 PRs and 4.2 points off his AF. <br><br>POM for March will have to be covered in a later update due to the stats already being archived.

        "content": "<p><b>Sup guys, two important things you need to know. Meade needed me to cover for him this week, and this update is a day longer due to the stats not reporting on Sunday, so it covers April 17th through the 24th. That’s about all you need to know. You can literally turn off your computer now. Unless you want to read the news, which is a little further down. You do? Fine, I’ll keep typing then. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Two new players this week.<br><br><font color=lime>Sebastian Giraud</font> joined with 38 times, all of which were raced on a legitimate Nintendo Wii console, I think. Other than that, I don’t know much about them, and hopefully he’ll finish up the timeset in the coming weeks.<br><br><font color=lime> Tonny Su</font> sent in 35 times, and even though that’s three less than Sebastian, he still is higher up on the charts. This means those 35 were better; however the other 29 could be absolutely atrocious, and knock him below Sebastian. Only time will tell. <br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Not sure if it was the extra day that I’m adding into this update, or everyone just had an urge to play kart, but 57 players were active in the 8 days of this update. Due to the vast amount of players, this section will be condensed since the movement will be longer. It’s over now.<br><br> “Welcome to the AF chart” goes out to <font color=yellow>#80 Sebastian Kovats</font>, popping into the top 100 in style and annoying a bunch of players below him. Also <font color=yellow>#237 Eric Shore</font> joined the AF charts completely, in a position where there’s nowhere to go but up. The Top 200 waits for him, and maybe in the coming weeks he can achieve it. <font color=yellow>#333 Stephen de Winter</font> appears near the bottom of the charts, but that means that he has great potential and the happiness of watching inactive players fall behind him left and right. Let’s return to the non-inverted standings and check out this week’s activity. <br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Jorge went back into hiding to hoard some more PRs or just play other games, and his sub 5-AF took about a tenth of a point hit, still far and away from the other competitors. <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> was not despondent in the least, putting in his share of the PRing action. Meade hit two PRs, not saving him from a gain of AF, however he did cut his losses. <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> was not slowing down, as usual with 8 PRs. He lost a tenth of AF, and is 1.5 AF away from Marc and gaining on Meade. <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> was also playing, trying to desperately fight back the points he lost, and had a nice first step. 5 PRs amounted to a loss of .6 AF points. #5 Doom stayed quiet, and this allowed for <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten </font> to sneak up on him. Jay made a landmark move this week, passing ex-site champion and longtime holder of the crown David McPartland, with 6 PRs and a 1.12 AF cut. At this rate, he should be passing Aziz for #5 in a few weeks. Just below, <font color=yellow>#8 Jak Russo</font> returned fire on Jimmy Benson who attempted to defend the 8 spot last week. With 5 PRs and a 1.5 AF cut, Jak not only passed Jimmy but surged out to a 1 AF lead on him. Bubbles is now 3 AF away from Jak, and at his rate the pass isn’t far off. <font color=yellow>#9 Jimmy Benson</font> hit 2 PRs, but they weren’t significant enough to allow Jimmy to hold with Jak, and he gained .6 AF points. To close out the Top 10, <font color=yellow>#10 Dustin Enders</font> had his usual hoarding spree, coming back with a massive 30 PRs and reclaiming not only his Top 10 spot but the German crown from Mark Schmidt, who he relegated to the paragraph below. The AF cut was monstrous, 8.62 AF off of his score, however he’s still 3 AF away from Jimmy.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Mark Schmidt</font> had an impressive effort of 7 PRs this week, but Dustin’s hoard overshadowed him. He moved past Tyler McNell, however due to Dustin’s move, kept his position.  He still cut 1.7 AF points, and is now another 1.7 AF points away from catching Dustin. This is one of the most intriguing country title battles on the site, and as Mark continuously submits while Dustin sits back and hoards, the outcome each week is unpredictable<font color=yellow>#12 Tyler McNell</font>, once a top 10 commoner, sent in 3 PRs of minor significance, but they weren’t enough to stop him from gaining AF on top of the sad fact he got passed by both Mark and Dustin. Jamie Disley was quiet for once, and <font color=yellow>#14 Tony Ruiz</font> had two PRs as well, but he gained AF and was passed by Dustin. <font color=yellow>#16 Eric Hacksell</font> had a nice submission of his own, with a three place jump and a 3 point AF cut. 3 + 3 = 6, and that’s the PR count for Hacksell this week as he displaced Ex-Top 10er. <font color=yellow>#17 Ben Hart</font>, who had 2 PRs and an AF cut, but still lost on the position front. <font color=yellow>#18 Alvin Le</font> would have gained a spot, but due to Eric he stayed put. He still jumped over Artur Bauer, famous for his over 100 point AF cut into the Top 10 a few months ago, but he’s been dead ever since. Back to Alvin, 3 PRs kept his AF exactly where it was last week, without one place gained or lost. <font color=yellow>#20 Cole Gilbert</font> had a nice three spot move with several PRs he probably achieved in the span of 5 minutes combined. He cut 2.9 AF, and never really seems to retire, but never really is active either. <font color=yellow>#21 Salvatore Bellusci</font> was shuffled out of the Top 20 with Cole’s move, and he gained AF even with 4 new PRs. Right below, <font color=yellow>#22 Matthieu Mayer</font> jumped from #27 with a five place move and 19 PRs, and now sits .4 AF away from Salvatore poised to overtake him barring a strong showing next week. The result will be interesting, so stay tuned here. <font color=yellow>#23 Alexandre Gilet</font> dropped back two spots, but still played even with this misfortune. His 4 PRs almost allowed him to break even on the AF losses, however he can recover in the coming weeks. Finally, <font color=yellow>#25 Thomas van Deerse</font> continues in this group hovering on the fringe with 3 PRs and a .3 AF cut. Mickael Smolen was notably displaced from the Top 25 this week, adding another karter to the list of drop-outs with all of these rising stars taking their place. <br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Here’s where the drop off in activity began, where karting was scattered and those who moved moved well. <font color=yellow>#30 Kevin Mason</font>  had three PRs that moved him up three spots, cutting 1.5 AF in a close pack. The next karter is about 3 AF away, so more work awaits. <font color=yellow>#34 Liam Ashcroft</font> moved up a spot with 6 PRs and a .6 AF cut, and five players are within the next 3 AF points, so with a good week the places could fly. <font color=yellow>#37 Oliver Martin</font> gained some AF with only 2 PRs, but did manage to gain about .4 less than his counterparts due to playing. <font color=yellow>#39 Zane Royal</font> had a solid week of 1 AF point cut and 3 PRs raced, however <font color=yellow>#40 Daniel Raftery</font> had a massive spree of PRs, not only on RR flap where he took the SR, but on 23 other PRs. He had a 10 point AF cut and jumped three spots to settle right behind Zane. Finally, <font color=yellow>#48 Zack McNell</font> did one of those weird things on the rankings that should never happen. He submitted three PRs, moved up a spot, but lost AF. Weird as it is, Zack doesn’t care since it puts him further and further away from dropping out of the Top 50. <br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Speaking of dropping out of the Top 50, <font color=yellow>#51 Tim van Ham</font> might cause someone to do that if he keeps his pace. This week he sent in 4 PRs to gain a minor amount of AF, but drew closer to his inactive compatriots. <font color=yellow>#60 Marvin Donjes</font> had a five place improvement with 13 PRs, also cutting 2.8 AF. Another 5 or so karters are within the next 3 AF points, so another charge from Donjes could be imminent if he keeps up his pace. <font color=yellow>#68 Yann Deptia</font> had 16 PRs to jump from #73. With a 7.4 AF cut, he had some graveyards to fight over, however he’s in the middle of a pack now, so place movement should become much easier. <font color=yellow>#83 Jon Coppernoll</font> and <font color=yellow>#84 Danny Gallenberger</font> moved together. Danny hit 3 PRs, cut one point of AF, but dropped a spot on his ranking. That’s because Jon hit 6 PRs, cut 2.8 AF, and passed Ashley O’Hara. Danny passed Degausser too, however the joining of Sebastian Kovats combined with the pass from Jon has two losses plus one gain to average out to a one spot loss. Near the back, everyone was active. <font color=yellow>#92 Thibaud Bordeau</font> notched 13 PRs to move up two places with a 5.3 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#94 Emmanuel Debenest</font> had an inverse effect. 1 PR let him cut a point of AF, but he lost two spots in his ranking overall. <font color=yellow>#99 Noah Gordon</font> still fighting on the edge of the Top 100 sent in one PR, but the AF cut wasn’t enough to stop him from dropping back a place. Finally, <font color=yellow>#100 Simon Uldry</font> made a push from #103 with a 3 PR week to cut 2.3 AF. The 100-108 places are separated by 3 AF, so out of this group a bunch of people could rise to the occasion, even Frederick Hutchington, displaced again from this group this week. <br><br><font color=red>~~101-381 ~~</font><br>Down here, nobody really plays unless they are fighting for the Top 100. Most have already given up hope. <font color=yellow>#109 Dave Tandy</font> hasn’t, as he moved up two spots with a 16 PR week and a 6.4 AF cut. If Dave can move up three more AF he’s in the middle of a pack, where moving into the Top 100 will be much easier due to seeing his progress. <font color=yellow>#111 Martin Prigent</font>  had a PR, but gained AF and Sebastian and Dave made him lose two spots in his ranking. <font color=yellow>#113 Paul Tanney</font> is making a short comeback like his brother, and I assume fighting to rejoin the Top 100. 11 PRs came from the older Tanney, as well as a 7.43 AF cut and a move from #122. Keep up the progress Paul, and show the world that older brothers are on top! (Well there is MKDD, but regardless). <font color=yellow>#116 Christian Nemetz and #117 Loris Bagnasco</font> both played, both with 3 and 14 PRs respectively. Christian stayed even and dropped two spots, and Loris cut 5.3 AF and moved from #123. That’s the difference. <font color=yellow>#121 Dexter Howe</font> had a very unfortunate week, with 4 PRs sent in for a .8 AF cut, but a drop all the way from #118 from two passing him and one joining. <font color=yellow>#136 Brett Edwards and #146 Zack Weber </font> both had one PR and gained AF. Brett dropped one spot and Zack dropped two. However activity here came from <font color=yellow>#142 Tomas Pallaruelo</font>, with three PRs and a 1.1 AF cut, and <font color=yellow>#145 Polar King</font>, moving from #146 with a 3.4 AF cut and 6 PRs. <font color=yellow>#197 Tony Fan</font> had 5 PRs for a 2.4 AF cut, but this is so spread out that he didn’t move up or down a single spot. He would have moved up one, however Sebastian spoiled it for him. <font color=yellow>#222 Sean Wilson</font> is in the early stages where a 45 PR week might not actually be a hoarding spree, and he cut 39.4 AF points to move all the way from #255. Very nice week from him and hopefully more to come. <font color=yellow>#240 Dave Johnston</font> had 14 PRs for a 9+ AF cut and a movement from #249. Finally, <font color=yellow>#269 Julian Stephens</font> is still truly fighting from the bottom, waiting for someone to make a movie out of his remarkable story, as this week he hit 5 PRs for a jump from #271 with a 2.5 AF cut.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Only one SR changed hands this week, and only two were achieved overall. ROM reclaimed his rPG flap from Brett, continuing the battle between auto and manual on the flap, and inched closer to JG on the quest to recapture his SR title, second with 8 to JG’s 9. Brett dropped from three SRs to two, still a very impressive count for such a course-specialist based game. Dan of course continued his kart rampage on RR, improving the flap even further.<br><font color=yellow>Daniel Raftery </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> time of 0'47\"931 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'47\"840</font><br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens lap</font> time of 0'38\"558 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"548</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Only one award this week, a day off from 4th April POW being in there however it will have to wait.<br> <br>3rd April POW - <font color=yellow>Jak Russo </font>, for jumping past Jimmy with a 10% AF cut, as well as moving through the Top 10 when the rest of the group made small cuts, if any. <br><br>Thanks for tuning in to this news update, a little unexpected and a little late, but hope you enjoyed it nonetheless. See you guys in two weeks!<br>-Web<br></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Web here back for my third update in a row. Since I covered for Nick last week, that’s why you’ve been seeing a lot of Yoshi avatars lately. But he’ll be back on May 7th for his update while I’m having fun at the SATs. (Although I think NMeade’s doing them too, so nevermind). Anyway, let’s get to the action. This update covers April 25th to April 30th, due to the one-day longer update last time.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Two new players this week. This seems to be a new common practice, as one just isn’t enough.<br><br><font color=lime>Will Eudy</font> had 17 times in his first set of submissions, but with the rest to come his final positioning is uncertain. <br><font color=lime>Jacob Shive</font> submitted 32 times, presumably all the courses, and will most likely stop there (as is with most new joiners). Alternatively, if Jacob reads this then he can get motivated to submit the flaps. Hopefully that happens.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>An average amount of activity this week, as 43 players sent in PRs.  As the overall SR time creeps towards sub 69 minutes, hopefully the toppies will keep playing to lower it. <br><br> “Welcome to the AF chart” goes out to nobody, as everyone who joined this week didn’t have a full timesheet, and the people that were in the green section of no-return (everyone who doesn’t have 64/64), didn’t feel like being bold and finishing up. The good news is that two of the top five players in the non-full timesheet zone are getting closer to having full timesheets. Lee Duggan went from 55 to 56 times, and Victor Pavao went from 61 to 63. Lee is ranked 46th if all of the other 8 unsubmitted times were dead last on the chart, so when he submits them a challenger near the top will surely emerge. On to the movement.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>The top 10 decided to play dead relative to their activity the past few weeks. <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> is the constant force that drives the top however, this week with 2 PRs that brought his AF down to a solid 9.5. He’s less than two points away from catching Meade for his old chart peak at #2, maybe with this constant work it can happen. Right behind <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas</font> sent in 2 PRs as well, however ended up gaining almost a tenth of AF, the times not strong enough to keep him even. He fared better than Aziz Abdullah, who elected not to submit. Down to <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten</font>, the constantly submitting karter was quiet this week. He only cut .07AF points with 2 PRs. Regardless, everyone inactive gained about a tenth of AF, and Jay is still only 1.7  AF away from catching Aziz for the Top 5. <font color=yellow>#8 Jak Russo and #9 Jimmy Benson</font> both played, both hit 2 PRs, and both gained AF. Jak gained about .2 and Jimmy .1, but Jak’s lead is almost a point on Jimmy now, so he’s still safe with his #8 spot. The good news for both of them is how they are slowly catching up to Bubbles. I also just noticed that everyone active hit 2 PRs this week in the Top 10, maybe that’s the secret to advancing this high in the ranks. Hurry everyone, go and PR, but stop after you hit 2!<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Only five players active here, and it seems that the German battle has been forgotten, at least for one week. <font color=yellow>#15 Alex Shoal</font> sent in one PR, but still gained AF. At least he proved he has more MKW in him. <font color=yellow>#16 Cole Gilbert</font> submitted two weeks in a row, which is a little shocking however the results were nice. 9 PRs, a 6.1 AF cut, and a move from #20 to #16. Is Cole making a serious comeback to this game? Will he join the top 10 soon? Stay tuned to find out. <font color=yellow>#21 Salvatore Bellusci</font> had 6 PRs this week, also grabbing one SR by lowering his own MG 3lap. He did have a second SR on MG flap that he got throughout the week, but it was beaten again leaving him with only one. He did end up gaining AF, and the Top 20 is still 2.15 AF away, however Salvatore can work harder and grab this distinction. <font color=yellow>#23 Alexandre Gilet</font> had three PRs which cut .3 AF, however he’s stuck in an AF graveyard, trying hard to fight his way out. Finally, <font color=yellow>#25 Thomas van Deerse</font> had 1 PR to show for this week, gaining a little less AF than the rest of his inactive karters and hopefully  further securing his Top 25 spot.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#30 Kevin Mason</font> continued work on his times, submitting two PRs this week, however still gaining .2 AF. <font color=yellow>#34 Liam Ashcroft</font> had a similar situation, with 1 PR and a loss of about .3 AF. Continuing this trend, <font color=yellow>#37 Oliver Martin</font> had 1 PR for a loss of about .3 AF. All of this repetition probably annoyed a few karters, especially <font color=yellow>#39 Paul-Phillip Baehr</font>, who really hates things that repeat themselves for no apparent reason. Ignoring this probably wrong statement, Paul had 15 PRs that brought him from #43, netting an SR at MG flap. <font color=yellow>#40 Zane Royal</font> had 2 PRs, which cut .1 AF off of his score, but due to Paul-Phillip’s great movement, lost a position. <font color=yellow>#41 Daniel Raftery</font> was too busy playing with a kart on RR to worry about losing positions. Due to this, he dropped one spot from #40 to #41, although did hit 2 PRs, only gaining a little AF. <font color=yellow>#43 John Brunn</font> lost a ranking position, but had 4 PRs and a .95 AF cut. To close things off, <font color=yellow>#50 Tim van Ham</font> works his way up through the ranks to finally reach the top 50, from 51st place. He had 3 PRs that cut 1.6 AF together, some great cuts from him at such a high stage.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>The constantly moving <font color=yellow>#55 Marvin Donjes</font> moved up five places this week, helped along by 9 PRs. It’s been a nice time seeing his rise to the top of the charts week after week from outside the Top 150, and with more weeks like this (2.65AF cut), he has much more to climb. Farther down is the only karter to be Top 100 in all six games, <font color=yellow>#71 Stacy Needham</font>. Stacy moved up two spots from #73 with 3 PRs and a .9 AF cut. He’s trailed slightly by <font color=yellow>#75 Nate Paternost</font>, who joined in the upward current of a 4 place jump of his own. 8 PRs and a 5.7AF cut were the catalysts of this reaction. <font color=yellow>#79 Sebastian Kovats</font> moved from #80 with 8 PRs and a 4.3 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#82 Danny Gallenberger</font> is far and away from dropping out of the Top 100 now, this week jumping up from #84 with 9 PRs and a 1.9AF surge. Taking the vacancy is <font color=yellow>#84 Jon Coppernoll</font>.  J-Cop didn’t really want this vacancy, as it’s a one place demotion from #83 last week, however he did cut .6250 AF with 2 PRs. The new joiner in the Top 100 this week (as there always seems to be at least one) was <font color=yellow>#89 Andre Hoelscher</font>. Andre moved from #102 this week with a massive 22 PRs, which provoked a 16.2 AF cut to sit very comfortably in this elite group. <font color=yellow>#95 Emmanuel Debenest</font> had a .12 AF cut with 1 PR, trying to hold his ground among the forever-entering karters. Simon Uldry dropped out this week. <br><br><font color=red>~~101-End ~~</font><br>Well this was a little delayed in its arrival, however these players deserve a mention because of the fact that they played against the odds below the Top 100 and fought their way upwards. Starting things off, <font color=yellow>#101 Simon Uldry</font> hit one PR. He ended up gaining .26 AF points and dropping out of the Top 100 down a place, but his continued activity is positive news for the future. <font color=yellow>#112 Paul Tanney</font> has had a surge in the past weeks of returning to several MK games. This week he hit 10 PRs on MKW, and cut 3.4 AF points. He also jumped up a place from #113 over a large AF gap. <font color=yellow>#121 Dexter Howe</font> was active as always, and had a decent 1 PR effort to cut about as much AF as he lost and finish with a nearly even week. Slightly lower is <font color=yellow>#140 Tomas Pallaruelo</font>, moving up two spots from last week. His 4 PRs allowed him to cut over 2.5 AF points, meaning those PRs had to be very significant. With work like that the Top 100 isn’t that far out of reach. <font color=yellow>#146 Christian Wild</font> had a 2 PR effort prompting a 1.23 AF cut. He hurdled me, and even with his apparent “retirement” he should continue progress in the future. <font color=yellow>#148 Evan Simmons</font> was also active, hitting 16 PRs for a 21 point AF cut. He jumped all the way from #164 up to #148, continued weeks like that (if even humanely possible) could result in the Top 10 in a few months. Good luck Evan! Above the Top 200 cusp, <font color=yellow>#196 Tony Fan</font>, the kart only user moved his way up a place with 1 PR and an AF cut of exactly one place, or .0156. A surprise awaits your resident news update in the 220s. <font color=yellow>#220 Sean Wilson</font> had a 17 PR week that jumped him up two spots with a 6 point AF cut. <font color=yellow>#223 Munim Peerally</font> had an 8 PR week that sent him up from #235 jumping up the standings. And <font color=yellow>#227 Eric Shore</font> had a massive 23 PR week that sent him from #237 up to his current position. Closing out the group is the KartFather himself, <font color=yellow>#346 Sami Cetin</font> sent in two PRs that had him cutting a tenth of AF and moving up one spot.  Finally, a shock at the bottom of the charts. <font color=yellow>#378 Jeremy Lee</font> realized how truly pathetic it was sitting at dead last at #384 on the charts, and decided to do something about it. He sent in a full timesheet of improvements, 64 PRs in total, cutting 21 AF points and moving above 6 karters. His move leaves Peter Ferguson sitting in the worst position of all on MKWPP. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>A bunch of SRs happened this week, with three in total switching hands.  The resulting activity saw a shakeup in the SR table. Lee Duggan and Daniel Raftery both moved from 2 SRs to 3, and a T-6th on the page. Alex Shoal dropped from 2SRs to 1, and tied for 12th with all the other course specialist guys. Paul-Philipp Baehr made his debut on the table by grabbing a SR, and both Marvin Donjes and Jak Russo lost their only SRs this week and were knocked out of this group.<br><br><font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'32\"861 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'32\"425</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'09\"397 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"379</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Raftery </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road crs</font> time of 2'27\"420 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'26\"939</font><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square lap</font> time of 0'38\"990 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"954</font><br><br>Due to the fact that I'm finishing this unfinished update now, the awards that I missed will just be covered then. Thanks for reading! I could say see you in two weeks although I'm typing the new update now, so that would be lying. See you in two weeks!<br><br>~Web :cool:</p>",

        "title": "May Fever",
        "content": "<p><b>Back for another news update, this time the first week of May is the subject at hand. Simply put, the activity from 1 May to 7 May.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>No new players this week...<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font>  <br><br>The first week of May doesn't disappoint, with 47 strong and actively karting this week<br><br>A little change with this news update you will notice is that this paragraph won't be nearly as long as it generally is. That is because only two people played this week in the Top 10, which is dramatically lower than of recent weeks passed. Still having complete and utter domination, Site Champion <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font> didn't cut as much AF as he would have, but still submitted 3 new times to officially make a 3 AF gap from the United States Champ. The only other person who played in this area this week was non other than the guy that never stops PRing, <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten</font>. Jay lost barely a place or two in AF overall but still sent in 3 new times like Jorge to chop the gap to almost 1 AF from Aziz.<br><br>Picking up pace, the Top 25 gives us plenty to talk about with 6 players karting here. Up first, making the first positive AF cut of the update, former German Champion <font color=yellow>#11 Mark Schmidt</font> cut almost half an AF with 4 new times to send in. This creates a slim gap of only .5 AF between him and Dustin for both the German Champion status and the Top 10 slot. This battle has been pretty interesting the first half of the year thus far, and it doesn't seem like either one of them are done yet, that's for sure. Spanish Champion <font color=yellow>#14 Tony Ruiz</font> is still inching up little by little each time with 3 more PRs this week to become very close to taking over Jamie for the #13 spot. Apparently at a standstill in his furious progress, <font color=yellow>#16 Cole Gilbert</font> only submitted one new PR this week (I am pretty sure it was not a new World Record this time) and is almost 1 AF away from taking back (?) the Canadian Champion status. <font color=yellow>#19 Artur Bauer</font> makes the same move, with one new time as well, but actually jumps from 20th to 19th to be \"in\" the section of the Top 20, so to say. Behind him comes the new Netherlands Champ <font color=yellow>#21 Alvin van Asselt</font>. I am pretty sure this isn't a come back, as practically all of these times (16 of them) were made randomly over the course of around a year or so. Either way, they cut him over 8 AF and pushed him back from 28th to 21st. Last comes <font color=yellow>#25 Thomas van Deerse</font> who lost his title to Alvin but made 3 new times to keep himself set at the 25th spot. <br><br>Positive activity still shows from the Top 25, as the Top 50 did two better this week with 8 people active. Starting us off, <font color=yellow>#27 Mickael Smolen</font> shows some activity again, even if it was with only 1 PR. Sadly he fell back a place because of other improvements but he still has a lot left to cut if he put more time in. Chopping away at a once pretty large gap, <font color=yellow>#30 Kevin Mason</font> cut well over 1 AF this week with 5 new times. To move up 3 spots he only has to cut that same amount again, so keep pushing Kevin. <font color=yellow>#34 Liam Ashcroft</font> stayed in the same place like Kevin did, with 2 new times. Only a 2 AF gap or so separates him from practically the Top 30, so a good group of new times could make it possible. Like Alvin, <font color=yellow>#38 Brendan Payne</font> most likely isn't making a come back, it was just one time that was updated of his from months and months ago (probably TF). <font color=yellow>#40 Zane Royal</font> had the same this week with one new time to contribute, and rests right at the 40th spot at the moment. A few places back, <font color=yellow>#43 John Brunn</font> still makes consistent progress, with cutting more AF with 3 new times this week. It only seems like a month ago that he was back near 100th place and now he is here already, nice progress John. Near 50th, <font color=yellow>#48 Zack McNell</font> was pushed back with negative AF like a lot of others in this update but still submitted one new time to set himself up for next week. Finishing this area out, <font color=yellow>#50 Matthieu Sempels</font> jumps one place to finish 50th this week with 7 new times and almost 2 AF cut.<br><br>Approaching Top 100, 7 people played here, so pretty much the average number has been ~7 for most sections so far, a pretty nice number. Both <font color=yellow>#55 Marvin Donjes and #56 Tim Shelbourne</font> made one new time this week. Both are only a few AF from joining the Top 50 as well. Several places back, <font color=yellow>#73 Simone Bertini</font> makes a good move this week with over 2 AF cut with 6 new times and jumped an overall placement to boot. Behind him, <font color=yellow>#74 Lewis Benny</font>, long time retired player, sent in one new time (albeit it was probably one of the mass times that were updated). Either way, even with the time, he lost a placement to Simone. <font color=yellow>#77 Sebastian Kovats</font> cut almost half an AF this week with only one new time, which jumped him a place too. A few spots behind him, <font color=yellow>#82 Danny Gallenberger</font> makes a good effort at chopping the fairly large gap between him and the pack of the beginning of the Top 80 with 3 new times that cut almost 1 AF. The last person to report about here is <font color=yellow>#100 Noah Gordon</font>, who cut exactly half an AF with only 1 PR, how about that.<br><br>I am guessing 7 is the lucky number as it is the number of people who played in \"The Field\" as well. Nearly tasting the Top 100, <font color=yellow>#103 Pierre Doffine</font> cut over 3 AF with only 2 PRs which cut him 5 overall placements, quite the radical cut there. If only it was that simple in the higher ranks. Continuing positive cuts, <font color=yellow>#111 Viktor Silivanov</font> 1 ups 2 people this week with 8 new PRs to rest at 111th, cutting almost 4 AF, well done. A little farther back, <font color=yellow>#134 Dylan Scullini</font> cut one overall place with 3 new times to 134th. 5 places back we arrive to <font color=yellow>#139 Polar King</font>, who made an impressive 12 PRs this week to cut 6 placements, and almost 13 AF. <font color=yellow>#141 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> got pushed back in negative AF but still made one new PR this week to take some of it away. <font color=yellow>#163 Aubrey Clissold</font> was another person who had only 1 time updated since it was a relatively old one. Lastly, honorable mention goes to <font color=yellow>#263 Julian Stephens</font> for cutting 6 places, 7 AF and making 11 new times.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br><br>A nice amount with 6 of our Site Records chopped down farther.<br><br><font color=yellow>Bapt Johnson </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows lap</font> time of 0'23\"958 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'23\"934</font><br><font color=yellow>Andrew Grieve </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'51\"122 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'51\"070</font><br><font color=yellow>Andrew Grieve </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 1'57\"251 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'56\"895</font><br><font color=yellow>Clement Blizzard </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Yoshi Falls crs</font> time of 0'59\"308 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'59\"207</font><br><font color=yellow>Andrew Grieve </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 crs</font> time of 1'59\"038 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'58\"856</font><br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens lap</font> time of 0'38\"548 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"544</font><br><br>And that's all I have to say about that. To close out this update, I'd like to bid you a goodbye. This is my last news update as I am resigning from writing the news. It was fun the half a year I did it, but now I am passing the baton on to someone else who will take my place alongside Zack for the news. That person should be decided on and announced most likely this week. For all who have read and/or enjoyed my news updates, I thank you, and best of luck with future karting.</b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>While I'm typing up this news update, take some time to look down two updates and admire the 101-End section of my last written update. There was a huge amount of activity I missed, including people moving in the 200's, and a change in the dead last position on the chart of MKWPP. <br><br>First of all, I'd like to take a moment to thank Nick Meade for the help he gave me with news updates for these past months. As you all probably know, last summer when I first became a news updater the news was occasional at best, and his joining on the news team got me rededicated to the news and helped get it out every week. Now that he's retired, we are in the process of deciding on the next news updater. If you want to help out, shoot Nick or me a PM on the forums and we'll put you in consideration. Next week the new updater will probably make their debut, and if not they'll join two weeks from now since we have to get them settled. Enough rant, let's get on to the karting. <br><br>This fine May week of MKW brought few karters to the controller, as many were probably enjoying the warm weather for the first time in a while. However those dedicated players that did play had a great surprise as they made nice cuts with little opposition. Let's get on to the news and find out the facts. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>The norm in the new players column this week, even with the decreased activity. Two players joined us, and both with full timesheets. No I'm not lying.<br><br>The first player is <font color=lime>#141 Cyril Fulag</font>, who sent in all 64 times for a very solid intro ranking on the site. With such a high joining position, more is expected to come in the near future. <br><font color=lime>#327 Jordan Haack</font> showed great courage by sending in his first set of times. Many karters send in PRs one by one until they improve, and wait to join the full AF charts until they are guaranteed a good position. Knowing he had nowhere to go but up, Jordan sent them all in. I commend you Jordan, all new karters should take example from you.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Only 27 karters were active this week, a great surprise as activity had been constant for a while. However lulls in the action happen every once and a while and in a few weeks we could be back to full strength.<br><br> “Welcome to the AF chart” goes out to nobody, unless you want to count Cyril and Jordan. Then again, karters should just take their example and join from the start, and this section can be gotten rid of and I have less to type. I'll just keep it here for motivation when those few decide to make the leap into the full AF charts.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Up in the realm of the untouchable, the Top 10 was very inactive this week, realizing they had a nice cushion behind them. Everyone took a week off that is, except for <font color=yellow>#10 Mark Schmidt</font>. Once again renewing the rivalry for the German MKWPP crown, Mark hit 3 PRs and cut .6406 AF points, enough to jump Dustin (bumping Enders down to #11) and give him a .35 AF lead on the German Site Title. This battle has been interesting every week, and Dustin’s next hoard should switch up the standings once more.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Slightly more activity here, but proportionately, pretty much the same as only 3 players were active here. <font color=yellow>#19 Alvin Le</font> had a 1 PR effort for the week, and gained virtually no AF. This helped him distance from Artur Bauer and slowly move towards #18 Ben Hart. <font color=yellow>#22 Matthieu Mayer</font> is truly becoming an elite player. This week he had 7 PRs, vaulting him up one spot and cutting .6 AF points. If he keeps up this progress he can become the next Jay Batten (who I just realized was silent this week for the first time in a while). Finally <font color=yellow>#25 Thomas van Deerse</font> held on to his #25 spot with 1 PR. It didn’t give him a cut in AF for the week, however he gained less than others.  Hopefully activity can return here next week as well.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>This was one of the more active groups, with a whole 6 players playing, but again that’s about the same as last group since both the players active and total players in the group are doubled. <font color=yellow>#33 Liam Ashcroft</font> kept on karting as he’s known to do, setting 3 PRs for a 1.01 AF cut and a one place jump. A little below him is a group of three all committed to karting. <font color=yellow>#40 Zane Royal, #41 Daniel Raftery and #42 John Brunn</font> all played this week. Zane had 2 PRs that helped him not to lose as much ground, and he didn’t gain or lose any spots. The PRs potentially saved him from a drop, as Daniel cut .29 AF points and now sits only .2 behind Zane with his 1 PR. John was the one who made the move. He jumped up one spot to latch on to the train, hitting 5 PRs for a 1.96 AF cut. John passed KC master Joe Sebeny in the process. Closing out the group was the duo of <font color=yellow>#47 Zack McNell and #48 Matthias Sempels</font>. Zack had 3 PRs that sent him up one spot from #48 with a .56 AF cut. Matthias filled the vacancy, moving from #50 with 3 PRs of his own and a .92 AF cut. <br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Sadly, most of the activity in this group is near the top, which means that in a few weeks, this group could be even less active if those karters keep up their upward movement. Starting at the top position in the group, <font color=yellow>#51 Tim van Ham</font>had two PRs that helped him to move slightly towards Franco Gubser. Right below is <font color=yellow>#52 Marvin Donjes</font>. Before people questioned his skill and claimed he was just good at specific courses, however now that he’s nearing the Top 50 it’s hard to argue that his skill has grown exponentially. This week brought 10 PRs, a 3.5 AF cut, and a jump from last week’s 55th position. Right below him is <font color=yellow>#55 Yann Deptia</font>, a recent joiner to the charts. Moving all the way from #68 last week, Yann had 21 PRs and a huge 10.1 AF cut. Here’s where the drop off happens, and where there are a bunch of inactive players. Down to <font color=yellow>#76 Sebastian Kovats</font> is where everything picks up again. Sebastian had 3 PRs this week, that brought him up one spot with a .65 AF cut. Slightly lower, <font color=yellow>#82 Danny Gallenberger</font> found no need to stop playing, and sent in his one PR for the week. He stayed about even on the AF front, which is better than the karters surrounding him. That closes out this group, which is never especially active, however this week was at a new low point. It seems the few that are active make their way out of this group in a month or so and then I have to wait for the next mover to make it out of the Top 100. This is the group of people dropping out of the Top 100.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-381 ~~</font><br>This week, the 100+ group will not be forgotten! The same faces were pretty much active as last week. <font color=yellow>#102 Frederick Hutchington</font> was the highest active that had a three digit place position, trying to move back into the Top 100. His 1 PR didn’t bring that much ground, although he did gain about .2 less than the people around him AF wise. <font color=yellow>#114 Jamal Fluellen</font> was very impressive. He moved up a whole 9 places, with an 11 PR week, which cut him off 6.5 AF points. He’s known to hoard, so hopefully his next set of times moves him closer to the Top 100. <font color=yellow>#117 Christian Nemetz</font> was also playing, sending in 2 PRs but still dropping one place from Jamal’s huge move. Showing a testament to the massive amount of movement in MKW, Christian has been fairly active recently, however a couple months ago he was in the Top 100. <font color=yellow>#122 Dexter Howe</font> had a single PR that didn’t stop him from dropping a place on the rankings. Next active player was <font color=yellow>#147 Christian Wild</font>. He cut a tenth of AF with 1 PR, however Cyril joining above made him lose a place in the rankings. Much farther down, below the active 220’s group that was silent this week is one of the great stories of MKW. <font color=yellow>#376 Jeremy Lee</font> was in the dead last position two weeks ago on the MKWPP, a place he had held for two years. Last week he shocked everyone by handing the reigns to Peter Ferguson and moving up 6 spots. This week he continued his movement, with a full 7 AF points cut off. He moved up 2 positions, and had 4 PRs. With continued activity, he could reach the Top 350 soon. The hardest part about the bottom is that the players are few and far between, large AF gaps separate them. Good luck to Jeremy on his upward battle! <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Nothing in the SR column this week. Judging by the forum posts I've seen, our mysterious new news updater next week will have some news to cover in this section, however that's it for me this week.<br><br>For the awards section, check back this evening when I get home for school. I finished up the movement though, and that's really what you care about. Thanks for reading, and see you in maybe two weeks!<br><br>~Web</p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hey everyone, Web here, I'll be getting around to posting the news tonight. Just wanted to pass on some news to you guys. The new updater for the site has been chosen by me and Nick, and will make their debut on the news this Sunday, May 29th for the 22-28th Update. <br><br>My update covers the 15th to the 21st, and I'll put it up tonight. Just figure you'd want that news.<br><br>Also, on another note, we're over 50% on the domination page, I think that's the first time I've seen that number. Keep it up and maybe with recruiting we can get 100% by 2020!<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>No new players this week. Not really sure why, but I guess we had a nice streak for a while. Hopefully next week will start back up the trend.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>As with last week's 29 players, this week only brought 27 to the site. Everyone must miss Nick.<br><br>Our “Welcome to the AF chart” goes out to behind <font color=yellow>#166 Tonny Su</font>, who joined about a month ago on the April 30th update. This update he sneaks in at a decent starting position before the month of June strikes. Other than that, no one else joined the AF charts, but I'm happy with just one joining. With Tonny's entry, 387 players now sit on the charts, nearing the big 400 mark. Let's get on to the real movement.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>As with last week, the Top 10 wasn't active at all, even less active than last time. The  The top 10 decided to play dead relative to their activity the past few weeks. <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten</font> was the only active karter, trying to fight his way into the Top 5 spots on the charts. With 4 solid PRs, Jay cut .7188 AF points and ascended further away from ex-champ Bubbles and closer to Aziz Abdullah. If Doom doesn't return to activity soon another \"Jay Batten week\" should cause his downfall. Only .4 AF separates Jay from his Top 5 goal. You'll have to see what happens later today.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>In this group, as with last week, only three players played. The difference was that only one of them was active last week. That shows a glimmer of hope, as different players are playing albeit sparingly. Starting things off, <font color=yellow>#16 Cole Gilbert</font> came back from the dead to grab a SR (that's all he ever does), however not cutting much AF since he was already close to the top on the chart there. He's stuck in the middle of a group now, so he'll have to make a small effort to try and pass Alex Shoal, although I'm not really sure he's interested in moving up. Regardless, most of us know he could if he wanted to. Next up is <font color=yellow>#22 Matthieu Mayer</font>, submitting 3 times this week. They overcame the general AF gain to cut Matthieu .29 AF, and send him a little closer to #21 Alvin van Asselt. <font color=yellow>#25 Thomas van Deerse</font> closes out this group again, still at that bubble position at #25. His 2 PRs cut .09 AF, but more importantly stationed him very close to #24 Alexandre Gilet (only about .2 away). With another week or two, Thomas could be off of the dreaded bubble position in this group. <br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>With a small (or big) delay on this news update for whatever reason, let's get back to the news in late May.... :P. This was a very active section as usual, with the bulk of karters playing here. Starting things off, <font color=yellow>#30 Kevin Mason</font> sent in one PR, however it didn't have much of an impact on his AF score as he gained about the same rate as the players around him. Even so, continued activity is better than nothing! Moving to the first player with an AF cut here we reach <font color=yellow>#38 Zane Royal</font>, who hit 4 PRs for a sweet .85 AF cut. This normally wouldn't mean much, however the great amount of activity here leaves groups clustered, and Zane ended up passing two players from #40 due to his activity and their lack thereof. <font color=yellow>#41 John Brunn</font> is a member of the new breed of karters originating in the past year or so that has been making huge strides on the page. He's up another place from last week, 7 PRs bringing in a 3.2 AF cut. John has finally overcome a massive 6 AF graveyard, which is huge for such a high spot on the page. He's now locked on to a nice train that doesn't have AF gaps of more than 1 up until the Top 15, so one of the final major pushes has just been made. <font color=yellow>#42 Daniel Raftery</font> suffered because of this, even with his one PR that brought on a tenth AF cut, he got jumped by John. Dan is on the verge of breaking this graveyard too, so both can follow each other higher on the charts. Notable place jumpers this week include <font color=yellow>#45 Franco Gubser</font>, moving from the bubble spot at #50 up a nice 5. His week included 6 PRs and a 2.53 AF cut. This great week overshadows <font color=yellow>#46 Zack McNell</font>'s. Zack had 5 PRs and a 1.1 AF cut, including passing Kyle R and Mike Smith (*cough* inviso *cough*) to move up two spots, but Franco pushed him back one for a net gain of one place. Closing out the Top 50 is a new entry, the player that never seems to stop PRing, ever since he joined in the low 100s. <font color=yellow>#48 Marvin Donjes</font> ascends from #52 with 13 PRs and a 3.09 AF cut. He never seems to stop getting new times, however this active group combined with its fair share of AF graveyards may prove difficult. <br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Following the most active group is ironically usually the least active group here. They didn't fail to disappoint, as out of 50 possible karters that could have grabbed at least one PR, only four decided to. It's no wonder why people like Donjes and Brunn ascended through this group so quickly, as no one else is around to bring you down. In fact, this group is the treadmill group, as several karters just fly through here as the rest slowly drift down. The most recent graduate was Marvin Donjes, and now that he's out of the picture someone has to take his place. Will it be <font color=yellow>#53 Yann Deptia</font>? Already a few spots from leaving, Yann only joined a few months ago. This week he shot up two places with 6 PRs and a 1.7 AF cut. Two more weeks like that and he'll be gone, leaving even less activity in this group. Traveling down past a pile of dusty controllers we reach <font color=yellow>#71 Sebastian Kovats</font>, potential successor #2 to the 51-100 destroyer crown. He moved from #75 to #71 this week, which is promising. He also cut 3.32 AF. Keep up that progress and you'll be out of the group in no time! Two players in the 80s close out this group. <font color=yellow>#82 Danny Gallenberger</font> is far and away from the 100 zone, and had 1 PR this week that cut just enough AF to take him a little below the baseline for the week, .0625. Finally, <font color=yellow>#86 Thibaud Bordeau</font> jumped from #93 (yay inactivity!), aided by 12 PRs and a 3.75 cut. <br><br><font color=red>~~101-387 ~~</font><br>In the constant quest to get two digits after your ranking on the MKWPP, we reach the band of a couple hundred hopefuls fighting for that goal. Just barely missing out on that classification this week was <font color=yellow>#101 Frederick Hutchington</font>. With 3 PRs, he jumped up from #102 with a solid .42 AF cut, however standing between him and the Top 100 distinction is a 2.9 AF wall. The climb is worth it (or so I've heard), and Frederick has breathed the fresh air of the Top 100 before, so getting back is even a better feeling. Good luck! <font color=yellow>#111 Viktor Silivanov</font> had a 5 PR week, that brough a 2.28 AF cut but nothing place wise. <font color=yellow>#114 Loris Bagnasco</font> fared better here, jumping from #118 with 14 PRs and a 5.43 AF cut. Both could post serious threats for joining the Top 100, because once you're in, you're pretty much in as long as you keep playing. Further down is a trio of karters, <font color=yellow>#138 Sam Smith, #140 Cyril Fulag, and #142 Tomas Pallaruelo</font>. Sam had 3 PRs for a .4375 AF cut, and no place change. Cyril had 5 PRs for a 1.41 AF cut, and a one place jump. Finally Tomas brought one PR, but gained AF, albeit slightly less than his inactive competitors. Passing Tonny Su's entry at #166, and falling much farther down, we find <font color=yellow>#218 Eric Shore</font>, with 23 PRs and a 13.1 AF cut. Very nice activity showing great potential there, jumping 9 spots in the rankings. <font color=yellow>#222 Michael Timpe</font> had an interesting week. He had 4 PRs and a 3.071 AF cut, which was enough to jump two players. However with Eric Shore's jump bumping him back down one and Tonny's joining doing the same, he's back in 222nd again. At least it's a cool numbered position. Closing out the news are <font color=yellow>#262 Julien Stephens and #286 Andre Riviere</font>. Julien had 4 PRs, a 1.92 AF cut, and a 2 place jump, while Andre had 8 PRs, a 5.48 AF cut, and a 3 place jump. Decent progress from these lower-ranked karters with more ground ahead. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Minimal SR activity this week, however better than last week's invisible SRs. Cole took Delfino 3lap away from Sword, shifting the charts a little bit. Sword drops to T-5 with 3 SRs, and Cole jumps to T-9 with 2. On a separate note, I just noticed that we're nearing the sub 69 minute mark for 3lap and flap combined SRs. Down to 69:05.803 from .913 last week, hopefully in the next few months with some SR activity this goal can become a reality. <br><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square crs</font> time of 2'05\"413 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'05\"303</font><br><br>That's the news for this week. As for awards, check out the really long titled news update near the top of the page for information on them getting caught up. Thanks for reading!<br><br>~Web</p>",

So, let's check out all the movement and new players!<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Three new players joined us this week, although none of them with full time sheets.

It must run in his family. Hopefully we'll see some more action from him in the coming weeks and a push into the Top 250.<br><br>In other news, new name <font color=yellow>Violet Breeze</font> wins our \"Almost-Welcome to the AF chart\" award.<br><br><font color=red>~1-10~</font><br>Once again, not very much action in the top 10 this week. So, that means <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten</font> gets this entire portion of the news update to himself. He sent in 3 PRs this week with a .1 AF cut, whereas inactive Aziz lost .17 AF this week. Jay is now less than .2 AF points from the elite Top 5. <br><br><font color=red>~11-20~</font><br>In this portion, once again one will see just about nothing but zombies. Only one player was actively sending in PRs. The rest were dead, but not really because they are still there. Anyway... that active player is <font color=yellow>#12 Tyler McNell</font>. McNell only sent in 2 PRs this week, but made over half an AF cut. He has almost covered the AF graveyard between 13th and 11th, and if he keeps this up we may see him in the Top 10.<br><br><font color=red>~21-50~</font><br>Welcome to the active zone! This portion of the AF ladder for many was like the security lines at the airport. A lot of jostling and forward progress, but seemingly getting nowhere.<br><br>This may have felt the case largely due to <font color=yellow>#32 Daniel Raftery</font>. This guy apparently took the platinum access or something and skipped 10 players with 10 PRs and a 5.8 AF cut! Will the others be able to catch up to this kind of progress?<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Liam Ashcroft</font> might be able to chase Daniel down. He sent in 4 PRs this week, passing inactive Lucas Acek. Also a possible contender for the Top 30 is <font color=yellow>#35 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> who sent in 9 PRs this week with a 3.5 AF cut. It was enough to pass 5 players, losing a spot though to Daniel. <br><br><font color=yellow>#37 Andrew Tran</font> also sent in a PR this week and made a 0.5 AF cut. Despite this, he still loses a place, but not a place on the news update!<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Zane Royal</font> sent in a PR as well with an AF cut, but remarkably lost two places! I suppose that's one small step for Zane, one giant leap for Baehr and Raftery. <br><br>Not much further down we have <font color=yellow>#44 Alberto Fiorese</font>. His action was impressive this week with 13 PRs sent and a 3.4 AF cut. He's got a massive AF graveyard to battle though if he wants to enter the Top 40. Will he be able to do it? <br><br>Depends, as the competition is fierce behind him with <font color=yellow>#46 Marvin Donjes</font>, who sent in 10 PRs and made a 1.4 AF cut. <br><br>Last to mention in the Top 50 is its new active entrant, <font color=yellow>#49 Tim van Ham</font>, who made a nice cut this week and is also pressuring active #48 Zack McNell. Congratulations Tim and good luck to you for the future!<br><br><font color=red>~51-100~</font><br>In here, the action is a bit quieter and spaced out. Kind of reminds me of walking to the security line; nobody really jostling, many people off to the side drinking their Starbucks, although one will still definitely see a person in a rush, weaving in and out of the commuters in front of him. <br><br><font color=yellow>#53 Yann Deptia</font> is the closest of these individuals to the security checkpoint. He didn't pass anybody, but his 3 PRs are enough to bring him within 4 AF of the Top 50.<br><br>Similarly, <font color=yellow>#71 Sebastian Kovats</font> turned in quite a few PRs and made a nice cut.<br><br><font color=yellow>#82 Danny Gallenberger</font> also sent in a PR that passed about 30 players on the course or lap, but he still lost over .5 AF.<br><br><font color=red>~101-Satellite Parking Zone 2 section Z~</font><br>Again, a few active players were in this bracket, all of them leisurely taking their time driving up to the airport terminal. <br><br><font color=yellow>#109 Viktor Silivanov</font>, <font color=yellow>#113 Loris Bagnasco</font>, and <font color=yellow>#138 Cyril Fulag</font> all made nice AF cuts and passed a couple players. (Although for Viktor it seems his rDH time is a bit off, so we'll see how things look after that smoke clears.)<br><br>Way farther down (much farther than Daily Parking) we find <font color=yellow>#210 Eric Shore</font> who was active this week, passing a decent amount of players (9). <font color=yellow>#220 Sean Wilson</font> also finds a parking spot a bit farther back. Lastly, in the satellite parking you will find <font color=yellow>#335 Stephen De Winter</font>, who is the only active player outside the Top 300 this week.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Three new site records this week, all of them fast-laps. I almost said four here by the way, but a 17 second fast lap on DS Desert Hills doesn't seem possible. I'm sure our time updating crew will have this fixed shortly though. :cool:<br><br><font color=yellow>Yann Deptia </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows lap</font> time of 0'23\"934 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'23\"924</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine lap</font> time of 0'09\"393 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"386</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain lap</font> time of 0'40\"450 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'39\"902</font><br><br>Well, that covers it all looks like.

Maybe we'll see some new faces next week. <br><br><font color=red>~Movement~</font><br>24 Players were active this week, and many players lost some significant AF. Where could all that AF have gone? Let's find out... <br><br><font color=red>~1-10~</font><br>One player was active in the Top 10 this week, and he happens to also be <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font>. He turned in two PRs this week, including the new Site Record, and cut nearly a tenth an AF point. With the second ranked player retired from AF play, and third place Shaun nearly double the AF of Jorge, could we be looking at a very long-standing champion?<br><br><font color=red>~11-20~</font><br>Shockingly, not a single new PR can be found in this entire field of players this week. Will one of these players step up their game and take advantage of the inactivity?<br><br><font color=red>~21-50</font><br>Five players were active in this wave, the foremost of which being <font color=yellow>#21 Matthieu Mayer</font>. Matthieu made superb progress this week, turning in 4 PRs which resulted in a 1.5 AF cut. He is just 1.5 more AF away from the inactive Top 20, so hopefully we'll continue to see him climb the ranks!<br>Not far behind, we see <font color=yellow>#24 Thomas van Deerse</font>. He too is close to the Top 20 and could very well be a powerful contender. He turned in 3 PRs this week and made a 0.9 AF cut. Keep it up! <br>Another skip away is <font color=yellow>#31 Liam Ashcroft</font>. \"LAsh\" made a decent 3 PRs this week, enough for a 0.8 AF cut and two places gained. <br><font color=yellow>#39 Oliver Martin</font>'s activity, even though it was \"just\" 1 PR, was enough to hold off active Zane Royal. A little bit farther, and he will hit a tight pack of inactive players, so with these two both active, well, expect some action!<br>Furthest down in this range of players is <font color=yellow>#47 Matthias Sempels</font>. He played the game impressively this week, submitting 10 PRs. It was enough for a 2.8 AF cut and a move well into the Top 50! It takes a lot of work nowadays to break this barrier, so congrats to him.<br><br><font color=red>~51-100~</font><br>Despite this gap of players in the news update, only two players picked up their controllers and successfully PRed here. <br>So, props to <font color=yellow>#69 Sebastian Kovats</font> and <font color=yellow>#82 Danny Gallenberger</font> for their progress and AF cuts this week. Danny's was rather small, but he is nonetheless making forward progress. Sebastian's wasn't exactly minor though; he submitted 6 PRs and made a 3.3 AF cut, taking him under the 100 AF point line. Congrats to him, and maybe he will soon pass that rotting news updater in 66th. ;)<br><br><font color=red>101-T-Man</font><br>Activity! In fact, if my blearing eyes for want of sleep do not mistake me, there are 13 players showing up with PRs in this AF range this week! <br>We start with what appears to be a very close miss to the Top 100 by <font color=yellow>#101 Dave Tandy</font>. He landed 10 PRs this week and just about kicks Noah Gordon out of the Top. Should be interesting, especially with our \"Welcome to the AF Chart\" recipient this week: <font color=yellow>#104 Violet Breeze</font>. She is only 1 or 2 AF away from this significant Top as well.<br>Also of note this week is <font color=yellow>#111 Viktor Silivanov</font>. He will face the only consequence of accidentally submitting one time wrong, or having the updaters mess up, and that is having the news writer have no clue as to how much AF he would have actually cut this week. Keep it up Viktor, and I will (or Web will) be sure to get your proper stats next time!<br><font color=yellow>#132 Cyril Fulag</font> continues to make progress this week with a 4.5 AF cut and 6 players passed. Not bad, not bad at all.<br><font color=yellow>#139 Sam Smith</font> made a little progress this week with a 1.7 AF cut, although it doesn't seem he has passed any players this time. He might need to step up his game a bit, because <font color=yellow>#146 Christian Wild</font> lifted his fingers off the other MKs and played for maybe 10 minutes this week. Oh, what's that? Oh yeah. He PRed 6 times and made a 4.7 AF cut. C'mon Chris, so close to #1 on the combined (overall) rankings now!<br>Not too far away is our runner-up for the \"Welcome to the AF Chart\" award, <font color=yellow>#151 Victor Pavao</font>, who joins us with 5 PRs sent this week. Not a bad start at all Victor, keep up the good work. :)<br>Two more people of \"major\" note this week. They are <font color=yellow>#168 Tonny Su</font> and <font color=yellow>#202 Robin Cheah</font>. Tonny made a nice 1 AF cut this week, and Robin is about to break into the Top 200 it seems with a massive 19 AF cut. Make sure to seal that break shut with duct tape once you're done Robin. <br><br>Honorable mentions this week go to #40 Zane Royal, #197 Tony Fan, #212 Eric Shore, #219 Sean Wilson, and #222 Michael Timpe. <br><br><font color=cyan>~Site Records~</font><br>One new Site Record was submitted this week. Congratulations to:<br><br><font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez </font> who beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 crs</font> time of 0'52\"518 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'52\"415</font><br><br>Well done karting this week, MKWii community. Keeping track and reporting it all has been a blast, and hopefully my news updates have not put you to sleep. Now... has anyone seen those non-TAS charts?  :hehe:<br><br>~NStride<b></b></b></p>",

        "title": "Summertime Karting",
        "content": "<p><b>Hey everybody, summer has finally dawned on the karting world. This means everybody in school has a lot more time to PR and enjoy the outside world instead of being crammed inside a non-air conditioned schoolroom. The activity was about average today, but the great surprise was in the new members joining the site. Enough with the spoilers, let's get to it!<br><br>This update covers from June 5th to June 11th, 2011. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Five new players this week! Shock was wondering where all the players were, but everyone joined a week later than he was expecting. Only thing is, how many joined the main AF charts....<br><font color=lime>Zachary Tyler</font> sent in all course times before realizing the flaps can only be accessed on the endscreen. Good luck hunting for the rest of them, it's always nice to have another Zack on the AF charts.  <br><font color=lime>Christopher Ramirez</font> had the same 32 times, but was higher on the charts. While Zachary was about 391st with his set, Christopher turned in at around 187th, which is great for only half a timesheet. <br><font color=lime>Andrew Ahearn</font> saw Jeremy Lee leaving the dead last spot about a month ago, and realized somebody had to fill it eventually. With his initial timeset of all 64 times, Andrew secures the second to last spot ahead of Peter Ferguson. As we all know, anyone can improve from here. Just use Jeremy as your inspiration story Andrew, and you'll be in the Top 300 in no time!<br><font color=lime>Kevin Reinisch</font> was kind of boring this week, since he joined with 32 times, but was behind Christopher and ahead of Zachary at ~225. Not much else to say about him, so hurry up and finish the timesheet so I can track your movement! <br><font color=lime>Zach Walker</font> was the second Zachary to join this week, but decided he had to one-up his predecessor. Zach submitted 35 times, either the flaps he's most proud of or the three he could get after noticing that you can't see them anywhere else but the endscreen. Either way, the 35 seems promising for a full AF chart entry, and being at 303 now, there is some potential in Zach's times.<br><br>On an unrelated note, I think that's the longest \"New Players\" section I've ever typed!<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>The movement was average, maybe a little lacking as 39 players were active. <br><br> “Welcome to the AF chart” goes out to nobody, only Andrew Ahearn joined the ranks and he was a newbie this week. <br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>The top 10 was mostly inactive again, much changed from their previous months were everyone was actively moving. Only three were karting this week. <font color=yellow>#4 Marc Bas and #5 Aziz Abdullah</font> each sent in one PR. Marc's wasn't enough to stop the gaining of .0781 AF, and Aziz cut just enough AF to stay even for the week. If both want to stay in their current positions however, that's not going to be enough. <font color=yellow>#6 Jay Batten</font> was on his weekly rampage up the charts, this week with 4 PRs and a .2 AF cut. The cut for the week leaves him about .0185, or one place behind Aziz. This means Jay has to move up two places on one chart, or one spot on two charts next week in order to pass for #5. (Although that's disregarding the AF gain everyone naturally gets, you get the point). Will Jay finally join the Top 5, where he's been searching for a spot in for months? You'll have to arrange a meeting with my co-anchor, NStride to figure out that news next week.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Where NStride was searching for any sings of life last week, I found a minor amount of karters PRing in this group, four to be exact. Things start off kind of low, with <font color=yellow>#18 Alvin Le</font> and 3 PRs. Alvin cut .8906 AF with these great times, and shot up a spot from #19, hurdling Ben Hart. Following closely behind is <font color=yellow>#20 Matthieu Mayer</font> with 2 PRs of his own. Matthieu didn't cut any AF, but he was so tightly packed with Artur Bauer he managed to pass him by gaining less AF. Closing out the group, <font color=yellow>#23 Salvatore Bellusci and #24 Thomas van Deerse</font> couldn't overcome the gain of AF with their 3 and 2 PRs, respectively. Salvatore gained .18 AF, and Thomas stayed even, so the two moved slightly closer together this week. With no one else playing around them little efforts are all that is necessary to ascend.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Starting things off here was <font color=yellow>#30 Daniel Raftery</font>, making 8 PRs to jump up three spots, bringing a 1.8 AF cut with him. Trailing closely behind that cut was <font color=yellow>#32 Liam Ashcroft</font>, although his 1 PR wasn't enough to overcome the general backwards turn of AF points, and he gained some regardless. <font color=yellow>#35 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> had a nice 5 PR week that triggered a .45 AF cut, and behind him <font color=yellow>#36 Oliver Martin</font> had a 3 PR week that brought him up from 39th. Oli has been near the Top 30 at points however recently has been relatively inactive, it's nice to see him returning and still PRing. <font color=yellow>#41 John Brunn</font> holds his ground and gains a place from #42 with 3 PRs and a .6719 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#44 Zack McNell</font> is starting to get on a roll now, this week moving up two spots from #46 with his 3 PRs and .4375 AF cut. Only problem now is he's facing a 4 AF gap to #43, and once he reaches that spot he has a 7 AF gap to #42. It's a very steep cliff that will take work to climb, however as the Tyler McNell has shown, success in MKW runs in the name. <font color=yellow>#46 Marvin Donjes</font> is officially staking his claim in the Top 50 this week after two relatively quiet weeks. Overcoming a minor AF graveyard, this week brought 7 PRs and a .8750 AF cut. He's nearing #45 Alberto Fiorese and #44 McNell, however he too can see the major cliff looming in the distance. \"The Donkey\" has proven time and time again he can rise to the occasion, and this should be interesting. Finally, <font color=yellow>#50 Tim van Ham</font> tries to hang on to his bubble spot with a 1 PR effort, however failed to cut any AF, only gain less than others. With people lurking a paragraph below to snatch his spot, Tim may want to start PRing hardcore to maintain his class.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Getting back to this group, starting off the movement is <font color=yellow>#52 Yann Deptia</font>, who has been very active recently on the charts. He's almost clear of this group, leaving them after methodically making his way through the ranks. This week moved him up one spot from #53 with 5 PRs, and a 2.2 AF cut, or 2.75%. Slightly behind is <font color=yellow>#57 Harp Valentine</font> with a pair of new times. They moved him up one place as well, with a 1.35 AF cut. Another large gap follows before reaching <font color=yellow>#69 Sebastian Kovats</font>, with 2 PRs of his own. He ended up gaining AF by not jumping enough positions, however did lessen the blow to stay in place. Down to <font color=yellow>#81 Danny Gallenberger</font>, a 4 PR week is shown. It moved him up one place (seemingly the trend for the group), and cut .21 AF off. Everyone else below was asleep, showing how the trend works: the 50-100 group is for a few select players to use as a springboard to the Top 50, and otherwise is filled with players who just made the Top 100 and are slipping back down, or the past greats slowly falling back into unimportance. Take ex-champ Michael Fried for example, now sitting at #94. Now 93 players are beating one of MK's greats, and a longtime site champ. <br><br><font color=red>~~101-End~~</font><br>Starting off this group is <font color=yellow>#101 Frederick Hutchington</font>, still fighting desperately for that one spot that catapults him into MKW importance. He moved up from #102 this week with 5 PRs, cutting .718 AF and moving within 1.1 AF points of catching Cutz for the Top 100 ranking. Further down is another Top 100 contender, <font color=yellow>#108 Viktor Silvanov</font>. Viktor had 4 PRs, but moved up three spots from #111th, and only cut .6094. Maximum efficiency is bringing him closer to the elite group, and in later weeks we'll see what happens. <font color=yellow>#113 Martin Prigent</font> is next in line, bringing to the table 5 PRs which cut him .75 AF. No rank movements, however he's in a graveyard now (2 AF ahead of #114 and 3 AF behind #112). Here's where it gets tough to continue on. Next are <font color=yellow>#132 Cyril Fulag and #133 Sam Smith</font>, each playing this week and ending up right next door to each other. Sam moved from #139 to catch the next active train with only 1 PR (1.59 AF with 1 PR is very impressive), while Cyril had three that weren't enough to cut back the gain he got from other players. In the distance <font color=yellow>#143 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> had one PR of his own as he struggled to keep within distance of the two movers. Down in his own little world is <font color=yellow>#167 Tonny Su</font>. With 6 PRs he jumped up a place from 168 and cut 1.75 AF points. Farther down is <font color=yellow>#195 Tony Fan</font> with 1 PR that moved him up two spots, and <font color=yellow>#208 Eric Shore</font>. Eric's goal is to hit the Top 200 in MKW before moving on to other MarioKart games, and with 7 PRs this week bumping him up 4 spots, his weight is relieved by 3.87 AF points. <font color=yellow>#232 Murray Wright</font> returns to the scene with 52 PRs. They moved him from #288, and cut 71 AF points, most likely hoarded over some time. Closing things off are <font color=yellow>#262 Julien Stephens</font>, moving from #265 with 14 PRs and a 5.1 AF cut, and <font color=yellow>#285 Andre Riviere</font>, moving from #289 with 4 PRs and a .56 AF cut. Activity is still in spurts in this group, and new players are joining so it doesn't entirely become a dead zone. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>SR wise it was pretty quiet, with only three records slipping through the cracks. Paul-Philipp moved into a tie for 3rd on the SR table with his 4th SR, and Hahaae netted his second as Matthieu Mayer joined the ranks with his first. Losers this week were Jorge Hernandez, falling from 9 to 8 but retaining first, Aziz Abdullah dropping from 2 to 1, and Eric Hacksell losing his sole record on DKSC flap to drop off the chart altogether. <br><br><font color=yellow>Matthieu Mayer </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows crs</font> time of 1'15\"996 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'15\"964</font><br><font color=yellow>Ethan McCormac </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font> time of 0'35\"410 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"377</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 0'35\"095 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"801</font><br><br>Thanks for reading guys. As for awards, look up and you'll see everything up to the 3rd week of June has been caught up. They'll be regular again now that the task of getting them caught up is finished.<br><br>~Web</p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, just took a look at the awards page and realized it was kind of dusty. As I finish up the news update from yesterday I'll leave this as a placeholder. Tomorrow I'm going to get as much of the awards caught up as I can, since the POM for March hasn't been decided and the POWs date back to late April. On another note, as the second POQ draws to a close, I'm going to hold off on a vote for a POQ, since the last polls have been disastrous, to say the least. <br>Anyway, just keep on the lookout tomorrow as I get this updated. It's officially my summer vacation now (last final was today! :D), so awards are due.<br><br>Also, the May 26th Update is now finished, so check out #'s 26 to the end when you can, there were some interesting moves down in the lower sections. I'm finishing up yesterday's update now so watch for the sections to come pouring through.<br><br><font color=lime>~~POWs</font><br>April, Week 4 - <font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert</font>, for a small return to the charts with a 9 PR and 6.14 AF cut week. <br>May, Week 1 - <font color=yellow>Kevin Mason</font>, 5 PRs and a 2.4% cut off his AF count led the Top 100. <br>May, Week 2 - <font color=yellow>Yann Deptia</font>, 21 PRs and a 10 point AF cut after recently joining the charts. Moved from #68 to #55.<br>May, Week 3 - <font color=yellow>John Brunn</font> for 7 PRs that helped him clear an AF graveyard to move up a place. 4.95% of his AF, or 3.29 points were cut in the process.<br>May, Week 4 - <font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> hit 9 PRs and cut 3.54 AF points, leading the Top 50. Moved from #39 to #35 in the ranks.<br>June, Week 1 - <font color=yellow>Matthias Sempels</font> brought 10 PRs and jumped from #52 to #47. Cut 2.84 AF points and dropped 3.69% off. <br>June, Week 2 - <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font> ascended from #24 to #22 this week, helped by 8 PRs and a 2.25 AF cut.<br>June, Week 3 - <font color=yellow>Matthias Sempels</font> stands out again, moving from #44 to #43 this week. His 4.62% AF cut was the most of the top 50, 6 PRs shaving 3.4 AF points off. <br><br><font color=lime>~~POMs</font><br>March - <font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney</font>, for determination with a long AF graveyard in front. 25 PRs prompted a 17% AF cut (2.4 points), and a piece out of the massive AF gap to #2. <br>April - <font color=yellow>Jak Russo</font>, for a huge jump from #11 to #8, cutting 26% AF with 21 PRs (amounting to a cut of 9.6 AF points). Honorable Mentions go to Jorge Hernandez, Dustin Enders, and Shaun Tanney<br>May - <font color=yellow>Marvin Donjes</font>, for standing out below with minor activity above. 30 PRs gave a 8.06 AF cut (about 10%), and gave a jump in rank from #57 to #47.<br><br>Thanks for reading and good luck karting, these awards never stop so there's always a chance to grab one for yourself! <br><br>~Web</p>",

Other than that, not much to tell on how he'll slot in when or if he finishes his timesheet.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>The movement continued at its average pace, with 40 players playing this week. Hopefully the pickup will happen soon, or MKW might have just started to lose those 50-player weeks for good.<br><br> “Welcome to the AF chart” goes out to <font color=yellow>#183 Will Eudy</font>, joining back on the May 1st update. Two months later, his timeset is finally finished, and he settles onto the main AF chart in a comfortable 183rd to start. Everyone below lost a spot by default. However everyone below <font color=yellow>#215 Nicola Torre</font> are really angry because they dropped two spots by default this week. DarkRoy joined in at #215 after being on the site for a few years, and hopefully movement will follow. Closing things off here, a third member joined from the section of incomplete timesets, <font color=yellow>#349 Peter Lankton</font>. Anyone below #349 dropped three spots, but they probably expected that anyway since that area of the AF tables is filled with a lot of broken controllers and old strats nobody has touched for a while. Very long section here, lets get on to everyone else who already made it onto the charts.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>The Top 10 has been very quiet in the past months, after the time where 8 or 9 would be active all at once. This week only brought two to the table, and if you've been watching the activity in the past few months, you can probably guess who they were. First off, <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> had a 7 PR week, cutting about .32 AF points. The cut brings him under the 10 AF mark and makes him the third MKW player to do so. He's about 1.2 points away from #2 Nick Meade, who has retired AF playing, and with progress like this Shaun should reclaim his peak position on the charts soon. This news update would be empty if I didn't mention <font color=yellow>#5 Jay Batten</font>, as he's been active for months and months, each week coming with several PRs to work up the charts. Recently, he seems to have reached a stumbling block, which is perfectly understandable for being so high on the charts and only having so many places you can cut. Two PRs this week were the result from Jay, however he did gain .05 AF points and failed to break even. The gap for him is 10 AF points to reach #4 Marc Bas, which is a massive canyon for already being so highly ranked, however it wouldn't suprise me if in a few months Jay is still chipping away at the gap. <br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>It appears that in Mario Kart Wii, the new breed of players that are coming through the ranks are hidden one group below the top. The 11-25 section had more activity than usual, five players in total. <font color=yellow>#12 Tyler McNell</font> led the charge, with 3 PRs and a .25 AF cut. It brought him closer to German #2 Dustin Enders, however I'm guessing Enders has about 10 PRs saved up for a hoard he'll be posting soon. <font color=yellow>#17 Alvin Le</font> is next in line, with 2 PRs and a 1.26 AF cut. This great jump was enough to propel him past Eric Hacksell and set Cole in his radar. <font color=yellow>#20 Matthieu Mayer</font> had a nice week, with 2 PRs and a .406 AF cut. He didn't move in the ranks, but any cut of AF is a nice bonus. <font color=yellow>#23 Thomas van Deerse</font> finally is making his way past the bubble spot in this group, moving up another place from last time. His 5 PRs prompted a 1.85 AF cut, and now he's about a tenth away from catching 2008 POY Alvin van Asselt. <font color=yellow>#24 Salvatore Bellusci</font> is trying hard to regain his old Top 20 standing. His 4 PRs this week cut .48 AF, but Thomas passed him, setting his goals back another place. <br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Although not the huge influx of activity as usual, this group still had its fair share of players trying to improve their MKW standing. One player who has been mentioned at the top of this group for a while and is looking to make the big jump is <font color=yellow>#27 Kevin Mason</font>. With 2 PRs, Kevin had a nice .29 AF cut and is moving his way to the Top 25. Hot on his heels is <font color=yellow>#28 Daniel Raftery</font>, who had 7 PRs last week, enough to move him up two spots from #30. His 2.73 AF cut is also unmatched and a very nice deficit for the week. <font color=yellow>#31 Liam Ashcroft</font> had an uncharacteristic week by only PRing once and gaining AF, hopefully he'll be back in stride next week. Another player to watch is <font color=yellow>#38 John Brunn</font>, moving from #41 this week. With only 3 PRs, he cut exactly 2 AF points and continues to make a dent on the standings. Next up is a face we haven't seen in a while, <font color=yellow>#41 Zane Royal</font>. With 3 PRs, Zane cut .17 AF and moved up one place on the rankings. Closing out the group is a cluster of three active karters. <font color=yellow>#44 Matthias Sempels</font> had a 4 PR week that cut him 2.2 AF, however he didn't move up in rank. <font color=yellow>#45 Zack McNell</font> had a 2 PR week that moved him up one place with a .4688 AF cut. The victim was <font color=yellow>#46 Marvin Donjes</font>, who had 2 PRs, however gained AF and was passed. A weird backwards week for Donjes will most likely be corrected for the next update.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>It's official. There's no pulse. This group is D-E-A-D. Out of 50 players that could have played, only three, yes THREE actually did. That's a measly 6%. <font color=yellow>#57 Sebastian Kovats</font> is about as scared as I would be moving through a group of 47 dead karters, so he decided to work overtime this week and grab 12 PRs. Those PRs catapulted him from #65 up 8 spots, with a 4.8 AF cut. One more week of intense karting should let you see some active faces Sebastian, don't give up yet! Next down is <font color=yellow>#81 Danny Gallenberger</font>, who had 6 PRs for a 2.3 AF cut. It didn't change his ranking any, but he's on the verge of overcoming the AF graveyard he was placed in, fighting past 6 points to stand only 1.6 away from the Top 80. He has all the time he wants though, since nobody is really going to play here. Lastly is <font color=yellow>#100 Frederick Hutchington</font>, who made the jump into this elite group after beating a graveyard of his own. 2 PRs brought a .89 AF cut, and now he's passed Noah Gordon for the biggest bubble spot on the whole page. Will he last, or will the \"disease\" that effects so many innocent karters in the group strike him down. Time will tell.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-End~~</font><br>Down here was probably the most activity, which is surprising because this is where I though all the dead karters were. Apparently not. Starting things off, a player ready to leave the triple digits is <font color=yellow>#102 Viktor Silvanov</font>, jumping all the way from #108 last week. He had 10 PRs and a 4.17 AF cut, and next week he should be up there if the pace continues. <font color=yellow>#108 Virgil Blondel</font> rose from the dead to send in a 39 PR group, jumping from #145 up 37 spots. The 46 point AF cut is a huge accomplishment, but the gate to the Top 100 becomes harder to reach each passing day, so Virgil may have to continue karting hard to reach it. <font color=yellow>#113 Loris Bagnasco</font> is next, sending in 19 PRs for a 5.68 AF cut and a jump up one position. Right behind is <font color=yellow>#115 Sam Smith</font>, with 27 PRs, a 24.7 AF cut, and a jump all the way from #133. Apparently this was the week of hoarding in MKW, or just the week of ridiculous playing. <font color=yellow>#132 Cyril Fulag</font> continues progress sans Sam, and has 7 PRs that brought a 2.782 AF cut. He passed two players, however two passed him in Virgil and Sam, so he sticks right in place. At least the AF came off. <font color=yellow>#146 Christian Wild</font> seems to be active in every MK game at once at the moment, as he rallies to try and take Michael Fried's combined Mario Kart crown. This week he brought 2 PRs to the table, cutting .89 AF. Also, he gained about .002 combined ranking points, which I think is the first time I've ever cared about those on a news update, but since Chris is so close to the MK Champion crown, every little .001 is important. <font color=yellow>#161 Tonny Su</font> had 13 PRs for a 5.5 AF cut, moving up four spots on the ranking. <font color=yellow>#195 Tony Fan</font> had another 2 PRs that cut .7812 and let him pass one player, however he was pushed back to #195 due to Will Eudy's entrance. <font color=yellow>#201 Eric Shore</font> nears his Top 200 goal with a jump from #203 aided by 7 PRs. <font color=yellow>#241 Dave Johnston, #263 Julien Stephens, and #287 Andre Riviere</font> were all also active, cutting massive amounts of AF and PRing all the way.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Two SRs, and only one that changed hands this update. Danny Gallenberger took his first ever SR this week, depriving Paul-Philipp Baehr of one of his four. Other than that, the SR table stayed pretty solid.<br><br><font color=yellow>Danny Gallenberger </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'09\"379 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"302</font><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium lap</font> time of 0'35\"668 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"448</font><br><br>For awards, look down to see the great catchup. On another note, the 3rd POQ should be announced very soon, probably in two updates so keep your eyes peeled for the announcement. There it is, a full update at once. I think Shock isn't going to be back for the next update, so I'll have it for you on Sunday. Until then, keep karting!<br><br>~Web</p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, Webinator here with an on-time news update, as surprising as that is. This week brought a decreased amount of activity to the MKW world as the heat turned up. Let's get right to it!<br><br>This update covers June 19th to 25th, 2011.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>One n00b enters MKWPP's gates this week. <br><font color=lime>Jalen Woody</font> sent in 33 times, the one flap he submitted remains a mystery since again, I'm too lazy to check. Hopefully the rest of the sheet fills in in a couple of weeks.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>The activity has steadily fallen in the past weeks, with only 33 players sending in submissions this week. From a news writer's point of view it's easier on the fingers and brain, but my heart aches for the 50 and 60 player weeks again. You might force me to make a comeback or something. Scary stuff.<br><br> “Welcome to the AF chart” is also disappointed this week since nobody from the incomplete timeset world decide to make the jump upwards into full-AF land. There's a few players that have 54 or more times submitted, and only have less than 10 to send in. It's not that difficult and getting mentioned on the news is always a nice bonus. <br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Two updates ago three were active. Last week two played. This week the activity in the top was limited to only one. If any of you had to take a guess, you'd probably hit it right on the head. Yep, the only player was <font color=yellow>#5 Jay Batten</font>, who had a decent week cutting .23 AF points off. He sent in 5 PRs, which ended up cutting 1% off his AF score. He's 9.6 AF points off of #4 Marc Bas, but if nobody else plays Jay could reach the Final Four quicker than expected.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>The lucky number for this section is five, as it seems to pop up so frequently as the number of players that pick up their controllers here. Better than most groups in terms of percentage, but when you're so close to the Top 10 a last burst of activity is needed to reach the pinnacle that only the strongest of karters possess. Starting things of was a player close to realizing this goal <font color=yellow>#13 Tony Ruiz</font> moved up a rank with 7 PRs, shaving off his AF score by 3.4 points. Jamie Disley was the victim of this move, although Tony has 4 points to cut for another spot. Two active karters slightly below that couldn't overcome the backwards treadmill of activity were <font color=yellow>#16 Cole Gilbert and #17 Alvin Le</font>. Both sent in one PR, with disappointing results. Cole stayed dead even with no loss or gain on AF points, and Alvin gained .12 AF points whereas everyone around him gained .24 points. Slight victories, however much better than the dead weight around them. <font color=yellow>#22 Thomas van Deerse</font> is continuing his progress, with 2 PRs this week. He gained .14 AF points, however those around him that didn't play, namely ex-champ Alvin van Asselt gained more, and Thomas moved up one spot in the main ranking. Closing out the group is <font color=yellow>#24 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who was one of the two that actually cut AF here. He sent in 3 PRs to eliminate .3281 AF points, and close the gap on Asselt to half an AF point. Knocking Alvin out of the top 25 will be a milestone day, marking a further deviation from the 2008 MKW days and looking towards the future, although this group has to step it up for something drastic like that to happen.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Seven players were playing down here, moving throughout the group from those about to exit above to those who just checked in from the dead zones of the 51-100 crowd. <font color=yellow>#26 Kevin Mason</font> moved up one more spot this week, and is now in the prime position of this group. One more week could earn him the key to the second highest group, if he could cut off 1.6 AF points. That small graveyard poses a challenge to Kevin's slow and steady pace, however with no one else playing he should be the next contender to earn a Top 25 spot. <font color=yellow>#33 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font>'s highlight of the week was taking a Site Record at MG flap, however he proved himself in terms of the main chart. With 4 PRs, he cut .53 AF points and moved up two spots on the ranks. <font color=yellow>#36 John Brunn</font> also moved up two spots with 4 PRs, however his AF cut was different at 1.68 AF points. He's shooting up the ranks in this week and his potential seems limitless, hopefully the upward trend continues. Down near the bottom of the group lie three close karters, <font color=yellow>#43 Matthias Sempels, #45 Marvin Donjes, and #46 Zack McNell</font>. All three cut AF points, Sempels with 4 PRs losing .82 off his score (and moving up one spot), and Donjes with 8 PRs and a 1.67 AF cut moving from #46 up one spot. This displaced Zack McNell, dropping one spot on the ranks despite his .12 AF cut. His 2 PRs weren't enough, but any form of forward progress is nice. Finally <font color=yellow>#49 Yann Deptia</font> escapes the harrowing frights of the dead regions, and moves from #52 up three spots this week. His resume was 4 PRs cutting 1.42 AF points this week, and more importantly, a rank promotion.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Dead as usual down here. Maybe it's just that I got used to the 50 and 60 weeks too much, but this group never seems to have any signs of life. Six players played down here, and with only 12% of the group active the section is much smaller this time than usual. <font color=yellow>#56 Sebastian Kovats</font> had 4 PRs that brought him up a spot with a 1.12 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#58 Harp Valentine</font> was exactly tied with Sebastian last week, however his smaller AF cut at .375 couldn't let him keep pace and pass a player like his ex-tied compatriot. Augustin Berrios is now the man in the middle between this separated pair. Another active pair grouped closely together are <font color=yellow>#75 Nate Paternost and #77 Danny Gallenberger</font>. Nate cut 4.89 AF points with a 9 PR submission that only brought him up one place. Danny had a similar cut at 4.21 AF with 5 PRs and a jump from #81 up four places. At the bottom of this group are two karters that are clinging on to the edge of the cliff, desperate not to drop off of the Top 100 ledge. <font color=yellow>#97 Dave Tandy</font> sent in a 25 PR submission, cutting 7.06 AF and moving him up from #103 to grasp the group, determined not to let go this time. <font color=yellow>#98 Frederick Hutchington</font> moved into the Top 100 for the third time last week, and this week used his momentum to his advantage with a 5 PR, 4.18 AF cut week. Cut loose from the group is #101 Noah Gordon, who will have to fight back into the hallowed gates of double-digit placing.<br><br><font color=red>~~Everyone Else~~</font><br>Down here the group ranges from old pros trying to make comebacks into the Top 100 to rising stars ready to reach their potential and make the first big step to MKW greatness. <font color=yellow>#108 Virgil Blondel</font> had a nice hoard last week, and this week sent in 1 PR. It couldn't stop the gain of AF, but it was near even at only a .04 gain so it looks good for the future. <font color=yellow>#115 Sam Smith and #116 Martin Prigent</font> traveled together this week, with 3 and 5 PRs, respectively. Sam cut .65 AF and Martin cut 1.53 AF, although neither moved up any spots. <font color=yellow>#126 Cyril Fulag</font> moved up all the way from #132 this week, the first very promising week that we've seen from him after his entry recently. 7 PRs brought a 4.64 AF cut, and a great prospect for the future. <font color=yellow>#145 Christian Wild</font> is still fighting to be the best in MarioKart, and this week cut .7812 AF points with 2 PRs. He moved up one spot as well, and gained about .002 combined points, another small step to MK greatness. Farther down is the section where you can still submit huge PR sets in one week and it isn't a hoard. <font color=yellow>#180 Will Eudy</font> moved up three spots with a 7.15 AF cut and a quarter of his timeset improved. <font color=yellow>#191 Eric Shore</font> achieved his goal of hitting the top 200. Moving up ten spots from #201 with 16 PRs, he cut 9.9375 AF points, and possibly this great progress will convince him to keep with MKW. <font color=yellow>#194 Tony Fan</font> had 2 PRs, cutting 1.65 AF points and gained one place. <font color=yellow>#204 Nicola Torre</font> moved up 11 spots and cut 12.78 AF points with only 2 PRs, very huge PRs as they had to have cut about 384 spots each. The typical suspects were active at the bottom, with <font color=yellow>#263 Julien Stephens</font> getting 3 PRs but not moving up a spot, and <font color=yellow>#281 Andre Riviere</font> hitting 6 PRs to cut 7.58 AF points to move from #287. That's it for the week's movement, let's get on to the top of the charts with Site Records.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Two SRs were in the works this week, on one course. Mushroom Gorge got its fair share of mountain riding as Salvatore Bellusci furthered his course record, and the flap battle continued as Paul-Philipp Baehr took back his flap from Danny Gallenberger, who snatched it the week before. Only one SR title change meant little movement on the main SR chart, other than Paul moving up to T-3 with 4 SRs and Danny dropping off the list losing his sole SR.<br><br><font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'32\"425 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31\"747</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'09\"302 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"236</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Nothing this week since no deadlines passed since last time, however next time tune in for the 4th POW for June, the June POM, and the 2nd POQ for 2011! <br><br>Thanks for reading, I'm pretty sure Shock will be here next week, if not then see you next week! Keep karting, get that active players number back into the 40's and 50's.<br><br>~Web</p>",

        "content": "<p><b></b><b>Hey everyone, I'm back. We have had a crazy karting week, and I look forward to reporting it this fine Independence Day (Good Riddance Day in England).<br><br>This update covers the activity from June 26th to July 2nd.<br><br>Before we start on the news though, I would like to just put out there what the time updaters would like to see in a submission. We have had some troubles with the updating here and there because some basic guidelines are being ignored. In the future, please submit times in the following generic format:<br><br>--------------<br>John Doe:<br>LC: 1'10\"122<br>LC flap: 22\"193<br>GV: 21\"255<br><br>Thanks!<br>--------------<br><br>Time updaters do not care about if you use Wii Wheel all the time, what your YouTube channel is, or any side story that goes with your PRs. Also, please do not use spaces between what you use to separate minutes from seconds from milliseconds. It is a real hassle to parse a submission, then realize you have to go back and backspace every time entry. Also, it hasn't been too much of a problem, but please make sure you use the correct abbreviations. Time updaters prefer abbreviations and NOT fully typed course and lap names. Saves time for you too. Lastly, unless you are a top player that PRs at most about 3 times a day, please don't send in a new submission for every single new record you achieve. Seriously, please do not send in more than 4 submissions a day. It's not fun coming onto the updating page and realizing that you will be there for the next hour, with half the submissions coming from the same person and many times on the same course over and over. <br><br>So yeah. Just wanted to take care of that pet peeve I was having. On to the news!<br><br><font color=red>A new glitch</font><br>That's right, in case for some reason you didn't know by now, a new glitch has been uncovered on Coconut Lawl... I mean Mall. Although I won't be covering the new glitch in this update since it only covers through the 2nd, I'll just say for now that the World Record is currently around 50 seconds. If you haven't done this glitch yet, do it soon and I'm sure you'll gain some major AF points! <br><br><font color=white>The New Players</font><br>A warm welcome to: <font color=blue>Daniel Crutcher</font>, <font color=blue>Ovila Acolatse</font>,<font color=blue>Roronoa Fabrici</font>, and <font color=blue>Thomas Ullrich</font>. <br><br><font color=red>Activity</font><br>Lots of activity this week. So much so that it would be an eye bleed to even read all the activity of all the active players, so that means unless you did some PR action that was quite worthy of note, you're not probably going to be on this update. (65 players PRed). <br><br><font color=red>~1-20~</font><br>Really active this week! 9 players PRed, and since they are all so highly ranked, all will be mentioned. First off is <font color=red>#3 Shaun Tanney</font>. He made 2 PRs this week and further solidified his position as European MKWii King. Not too far behind him is <font color=red>#5 Jay Batten</font> who made 4 PRs this week. Continuing down this list of actives we find former champion <font color=red>#7 David McPartland</font>. He submitted 3 PRs this week. <font color=red>#8 Jak Russo</font> is right behind him though with 2 PRs submitted this week. We could find a bit of jostling around here soon given the new CM glitch.. <font color=red>#10 Dustin Enders</font> finishes off the top 10 with a strong move, a 0.4 AF cut where most others seemed to be losing AF despite their PRing. <br><br><font color=red>#14 Cole Gilbert</font> gets a mention this week, as he passed 2 players with his 7 PRs. Is he getting in position to try to take over the #1 spot on the combined charts with the release of MK3DS coming up? Further down we have some more old names on the active list. <font color=red>#16 Alex Shoal</font> makes an AF cut but loses a place, <font color=red>#17 Alvin Le</font> maintains his exact AF and keeps his spot, and <font color=red>#18 Eric Hacksell</font> also sent in a PR but lost AF.<br><br><font color=white>~~21-50~~</font><br>12 players were active in this AF range this week, so pretty active. However, no auto-mention rule applies here, so you will not make the main page this week unless you made an AF cut or submitted 3 PRs or more. Why? I don't know; PM Tom Gaffikin if you have questions on the forum. <br><br><font color=white>#24 Salvatore Bellusci</font> barely met this requirement, with 3 PRs but a loss of AF. He may want to keep up his activity though because only 3 AF behind him is <font color=white>#25 Kevin Mason</font>. Kevin made 3 PRs this week as well, but he did enough for a 1.8 AF cut. <br>This next player gets a line on the update completely to himself, because not only was he active, but he also passed 3 players with 11 PRs. This is quite impressive for this level of play. I am talking about <font color=white>#27 Fabien Jacques</font>. Congrats on a great week to him!<br>A bit further down is <font color=white>#31 John Brunn</font>, who had a great week as well and is closing in on the Top 30. He made 5 PRs this week and passed 4 players, so he gets his own line in the news update as well. <br><font color=white>#44 Zack McNell</font> also impressed this week by passing 2 players with his 5 PRs. Close behind him though is <font color=white>#45 Marvin Donjes</font> who PRed 6 times and passed a player. Donjes sits only .2 AF behind McNell, so will Coconut Mall end up being the tie breaker? Rounding out the Top 50 is <font color=white>#47 Yann Deptia</font> who made just 2 PRs, yet still progressed 2 AF points and passed 2 players. <br><br><font color=blue>~~~51-100~~~</font><br>11 active players in this bracket today. :) Again, you will need 3 PRs or an AF cut to get a mention if you play within this range. I am a bit less forgiving than Web, but if you make it on here with me you really earned it!<br>Starting us off here is <font color=blue>#54 Sebastian Kovats</font> who made a slight AF cut and maintained his position. Next mention goes to <font color=blue>#64 Ross Coleman</font>. He may have lost some AF this week, but he submitted 5 PRs. Right in front of him is <font color=blue>#63 Bob Holden</font>; I mention him because these two are really neck to neck at the moment. Once again, will CM be a major decider as to who comes up on top? <br>A bit further down and we see <font color=blue>#77 Danny Gallenberger</font>. This guy is overcoming quite the AF gap between 78th and 76th. Keep it up man!<br>This next contender on the charts really let us know that he is out there and moving up! I'm talking about <font color=blue>#84 Dave Tandy</font>. He made <u></u>29 PRs<u></u> this week! This was enough for a 13 point AF cut and a blowing away of 12 players. Look out! <br>Next up is our \"Welcome to the AF Chart\" award winner. Well, we like to welcome everybody, but the guys who join the highest get this particular ribbon. Say hello to <font color=blue>#86 Thomas Ullrich</font>. We'll see if he keeps progressing now or ditches us now that he's on the page. Of course the former is better. :rolleyes:<br>Three more people to cover here. First of these is <font color=blue>#92 Michael Fried</font>. Fried made 5 PRs this week and passed 2 players. The contest for the top position of the combined charts is on!<br>Next is <font color=blue>#97 Virgil Blondel</font>; Blondel passed 9 players this week with a 12 AF cut across 10 PRs! Really moving along... keep it up!<br>And last to cover in the Top 100 this week is <font color=blue>#100 Kevin Borne</font>. He cut .4 AF and barely managed to stay in this barrier, edging out Frederick by .3. Competition is again intense here!<br><br><font color=red>*101-End*</font><br>20 more active players here. :D This week, to get a mention in this area you will need a 3 AF cut or more or 5 PRs. Just because. <br>So, let's start this out with <font color=red>#116 Martin Prigent</font>. Martin had a good week this week as he made a .7 AF cut with 5 PRs. If he hadn't played on the other hand, he would have lost over 1.5 AF. So, well done to him!<br>Perhaps the mention of the week goes to <font color=white>#118 David Schiering</font> though. Brace yourself for this: 36 PRs, 88 AF cut, and 61 players passed. I would like to call hoarding, but you never know what people are capable of doing in a week...<br>Quite a bit farther down, and you will see <font color=blue>#143 Tomas Pallaruelo</font>. He had a successful week with 10 PRs and a 5 AF cut, as did <font color=red>#150 Victor Pavao</font>, whose 8 PRs boosted him up a spot. <br>A bit farther down is <font color=white>#181 Will Eudy and #187 Eric Shore</font>. Well done to those two for making small AF cuts with their 6 PRs. <br>As we head outside the Top 200, we still see a lot of activity. First is <font color=blue>#208 Sean Wilson</font> who made an 11 AF cut. Following him is <font color=red>#216 Munim Peerally</font>. Munim did particularly well, with a 27 AF cut and a nice surge to that Top 200. A bit deeper into this pit we find <font color=white>#227 Dave Johnston</font> and <font color=blue>#229 Murray Wright</font> both make a move of 12 AF points.<br>Joining us in the lower ranks is <font color=red>#234 Roronoa Fabrici</font>. Well done on joining the page, now make your climb! Maybe also new to the page <font color=white>#256 Daniel Crutcher</font> can help give you motivation.<br>Even further still, (yes, people are PRing even way down here!), climbing this ladder (or not really?) to higher ground is the last mention of this update. This goes to <font color=blue>#263 Julian Stephens</font>. He made a 6.4 AF cut and had 11 PRs and went absolutely nowhere with it. Tough place to be haha. <br><br>And that concludes the movement. Time for...<br><br><font color=yellow>New Site Records</font><br>4 new Site Records this week:<br><font color=yellow>Thomas Ullrich </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 0'19\"625 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'19\"581</font><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium crs</font> time of 1'50\"446 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"659</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'31\"444 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'31\"436</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'31\"763 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'31\"752</font><br><br>And oh will there be quite the contention for next week's CM course and flap. Who will be the ones to take it by the next update? I guess we'll wait and see.<br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Hey guys, Web here invading the update for a second to put in the awards that have been happening the past couple of days. For more info check the awards page!<br>~~POW<br>The 4th POW for June is awarded to <font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert</font> for shining the most in the top. His 6 PRs brought a 3.12 AF cut from his score, and he jumped from 16th to 14th in the main ranking, showing again he's never truly done with MKW.<br><br>~~POM<br>The June POM goes out to <font color=yellow>John Brunn</font> for finishing out a fantastic quarter with a great month. He jumped another ten places with the largest cut in the top.<br><br>~~POQ<br>The 2011 2nd POQ goes to <font color=yellow>John Brunn</font>, for a solid cut across the three months and a great move from #56 to #32, while cutting 25 points of AF (or 30% off his previous total) from his score.<br><br>After today is the deadline for the first POW of July, so it will be featured in my Sunday update. Thanks for reading and keep on karting!<br>~Web (sorry, couldn't resist)<br><br>~NStride (The guy Web called Shock last week. lol)<b></b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b><font color=cyan>Separate Charts Do Exist!</font><br>Hey guys, Webinator here with some important news you probably know about already, but with more juicy details! For all of you suffering for years after the discovery of Grumble Rock, Mushroom Mountain, Wario's Green Pipe and Bowser's Trippy Walkthrough Ceiling, MKWPP finally has a solution: separate charts. They do exist right now, and are currently being worked on so upon release the players ranking near the top of the charts on Non-SC aren't just horrible glitchers. (And believe me, I've found a bunch of 1:45 MG glitched times and 1:50's GV glitched times). <br><br>As of right now there are 18 times on the charts, both 3lap and flap for 9 courses (MG, CM, WGM, GV, BC, rGV2, rBC3, rDKJP, and rDKM). They will be separate Non-SC charts for now and most likely for the long run, with the combined or \"main\" AF chart staying with glitched times, because as you know by now time has gone on too long for the Non-SC times to get the upper hand on the charts, as many players who have since retired would be left with incomplete timesheets.  <br><br>So just to let you know, we're still working out the kinks, making sure the stats are working fine and trying to get everything in sync so we won't have any glitches upon the release of the charts. Just stay patient a little longer and all of your Non-SC dreams will be fulfilled. In other news.....<br><br><font color=cyan>Coconut Mall's Invisible Stores of Mystery and Happiness</font><br>As most of you know, the 9th glitch was found on a MKW course in the past week, as Coconut Mall fell under fire. The new glitch involves using the railings to bounce out of bounds into a safe zone, and then drive throughout all of Nintendo's great solid walls on the interior of Coconut Mall to trigger glitchy checkpoints and get a time under 50 seconds, and a flap of about 6 seconds. Loads of fun this MKW game is. Anyway, those times aren't on the charts right now because of the fact that we have to sort out the Non-Glitch and Glitch times on CM and make sure that everything is stable before releasing them. The WRs have changed hands many times, and for that you might want to check out Pierrepont's mkwii.co.uk site that lists the record history, but once the separate charts are released we'll take both Non-SC times and the glitched CM times on the site. Hang tight and keep driving through the various stores and cars around CM while the charts are finished.<br><br>Oh yeah, and apparently there will also be weekly news here, however I'll type that later tonight. This first section was mainly an alert for those who don't frequent the forums on the current happenings of the site and when resolutions are going to happen.<br><br><font size=4><font color=red>THE ACTUAL NEWS!!!!</font></font><br>Hey guys, ignoring those two important MKW issues and things going on right now we have an actual news update to bring you all. For some reason people love NStride/Shock/Andy/That Karter with the amazing voice who should release his Sky Garden Song from Fenner's stream to the public's updates more than me, because for some reason all of the big updates happen around him. Either that or I'm strategic with when I update. Regardless, only 37 players played this week, which is good news for them because everyone on the main AF chart will probably get mentioned. <br><br>This news covers July 3rd to 9th, 2011. <br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Three new players this week joining just as the Coconut Mall chaos erupts. Maybe it prompted their entry onto the charts, or maybe news of Non-SC charts is beginning to drive players to MKWPP.  <br><br><font color=lime>Gthree San</font> submitted 32 times, probably the courses. ~235th now, but then again that doesn't mean much.<br><font color=lime>Brian Smith</font> sent in 38 times. Why 38? Ask Brian, why should I know? Hopefully his timesheet gets finished, as any number above 32 is a step in the right direction towards that goal. Brian is ~374th, so maybe a little more work is needed on the flaps.<br><font color=lime>Alex Bjorkman</font> was weird and sent in 4 times. Other than that, I don't know much about him other than his last name is pretty cool. <br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>As mentioned above, 37 players played. Let's just get down to it. <br><br>Nobody gets the  “Welcome to the AF chart” greeting, because nobody was tough enough to make the jump from the incomplete timsheet section. Yeah I just called all of you out, now go finish out those timesheets, get on the full AF chart and make the MKW community proud!<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Two karters were active up here, finding it necessary to press on in their quests for MKW excellence. The Top 10 has really been quiet for the past few months as only a select few have really been active. First off, <font color=yellow>#5 Jay Batten</font> was obviously active, hitting only 1 PR this week to lessen his gain slightly, although not avoid it entirely. The MKW German crown battle intensified however, as <font color=yellow>#9 Dustin Enders</font> sent in his periodical hoard of times. The 13 new submissions shot him up a place from #10, and resulted in a cut of 2.64 AF points. Dustin and Mark Schmidt have battled back and forth over their country's crown in the most exciting country battle in all of MKW, as it is unpredictable who will have the better score week to week. Will Mark come back and take it? Time will tell.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Five players were active here, which is pretty typical for this group. The usuals were karting, starting off with <font color=yellow>#11 Mark Schmidt</font> determined not to let his German rival gain too much of an edge. Mark sent in 7 PRs, cutting 2.08 AF points and drawing very near to kicking Jimmy Benson out of the Top 10 for the first time in may months. He's only .2 away from the Top 10 again, and .8 away from Dustin and the German title, so the battle should heat up in the coming weeks. <font color=yellow>#12 Tyler McNell</font> sent in 1 PR just to keep up his activity streak, however couldn't cut any AF points and stayed firmly in place with a 4 AF cushion ahead and behind him. <font color=yellow>#16 Alex Shoal</font> made a small return to MKW this week, sending in 3 PRs, two of which were site records, and almost breaking even for the week. It helped him to draw nearer to #15 Jamie Disley who is only .2 AF ahead, however Alex seems to be wavering on retirement/inactivity so we'll see if the move will happen. Closer to the end of this croup is <font color=yellow>#21 Thomas van Deerse</font>, who moved up one spot this week with 2 PRs and a .15 AF cut. Passing ex-2008 champ Alvin van Asselt he only has more prestigious karters ahead. Finally, newcomer to this group <font color=yellow>#25 Kevin Mason</font> was at the Wii again, determined to continue playing so as not to drop back into the 26-50 group so soon. His one PR didn't help much, however it did make him gain only half the AF of the players around him, proving any bit of PRing helps out.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>A quiet week from this section, however that's to be expected from their usual playtime. The top performer was <font color=yellow>#31 Robert van Zanten</font>. RVZ moved up a place on the charts with 3 PRs and a cut of 1.06 AF points, hurdling <font color=yellow>#32 John Brunn</font> even though Brunn was active. John also had 3 PRs, but only cut .7344 AF, leaving him about .28 AF separated from RVZ. John has been on a tear and RVZ has been mostly inactive, so signs point to the pass happening soon, however RVZ might have some more PRs to share. Closing out the group are four players all in the 40s scrambling to avoid displacement from this group. <font color=yellow>#41 Zane Royal</font> hit 1 PR but didn't do much AF wise. <font color=yellow>#43 Matthias Sempels</font> hit 4 PRs and cut 1.07 AF, but stayed at #43. <font color=yellow>#44 Zack McNell</font> had a 1 PR, .9219 AF cut week that put him right on the heels of Matthias, and <font color=yellow>#45 Marvin Donjes</font> was relatively silent with 1 PR that didn't give him enough AF to stay even.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>You expected activity here? Only 5 players showed up this week, typical stuff. Starting things off is <font color=yellow>#54 Sebastian Kovats</font>, determined to exit this wasteland and move up into the slightly more active 26-50 group. He had 2 PRs and cut off one point of AF on his quest up the charts. <font color=yellow>#60 Bob Holden</font> had 3 PRs and moved up three spots, cutting 1.37 AF points in the progress. He seems ready to make the jump as well, sad for this group because it will lose activity. <font color=yellow>#72 Stacy Needham</font>, one of the only two MK players to be Top 100 in all games brought his talents back to MKW this week. 3 PRs almost brought his AF back to even, however he has 5 games to be focused on otherwise so he can improve more here when he wants. <font color=yellow>#77 Danny Gallenberger</font> is really making great strides since his suffering on the cusp of the Top 100 months ago. He cut 1.25 AF points and put himself about .6 away from Lewis Benny and his next rank. Closing out the group is the other one of the two karters in the Top 100 on all games, <font color=yellow>#98 Kevin Borne</font>. Kevin was an ex-site champion in 2008 battling it out with Alvin, and is impressively known for not using any glitches across the entire game. He just strengthened his membership in that group again this week by jumping from #100 with 2.78 AF dropped off his score.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-Obscurity ~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#101 Sam Smith</font> starts off this sad batch of karters, getting 20 PRs and jumping up 13 spots with a 14.718 AF cut. Right below <font color=yellow>#105 Viktor Silvanov</font> had 11 PRs and cut 2.03 AF off. Continuing this trend of impressive triple-digit karting, <font color=yellow>#110 Loris Bagnasco</font>had 12 PRs, moving from #115 with a 4.52 cut. Finally ending this streak of double-digit PR hoards is <font color=yellow>#119 Michael Schneider</font>, with 13 PRs, a jump from #121, and a 6.51 AF cut. Much farther down is <font color=yellow>#154 Tonny Su</font>, with a batch of 7 PRs prompting a 4.5 AF cut and bringing him up from #159. <font color=yellow>#181 Will Eudy</font> was active with 3 PRs and a .58 AF cut, but no place improvements. <font color=yellow>#202 Munim Peeraly, #217 Dimitri Coueffe, and #218 Murray Wright</font> all had AF cuts over 2 points and great batches of PRs that moved them up the charts. Finally, the \"Funky Kong Never Give Up Award\" goes to <font color=yellow>#244 Daniel Crutcher</font>, who hit 17 PRs to prove that the lowest active player on the charts doesn't always have to be the lowest active player on the charts. What did I just say there? I have absolutely no idea. <br><br>Honorable mentions to <font color=yellow>#187 Eric Shore</font> and <font color=yellow>#368 Quassim Weber</font>, who played but didn't cut any AF. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Only 2 SRs this week, and both from an old face come back to assert his WR status once more. Alex Shoal sent in his MC improvements, taking the flap from ROM and tying Sword's course record. That might be the first tie for an SR MKWPP has had in its history, although don't quote me on that because I'm sure that I'm wrong. On the SR table, Shoal made a comeback from off the chart to tied for 10th with 2 SRs, and Romain Smadja (ROM) dropped further away from Jorge by losing one and moving from 7 to 6, now two away from Jorge's 8.  <br><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>TIED the <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'21\"764 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'21\"764</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit lap</font> time of 0'25\"337 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'25\"325</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>I'll update this with the first July POW on the 12th, or tomorrow by the date I'm typing this. <br><br>That's it for this week guys! Next week and potentially the week after that I'll be down the beach, so you might see two updates in a row from NStride.<br><br>~Web</p>",

But hey look, now it's here!<br><br>Let's get down to the action right away. This news covers the activity from July 10th to July 16th, and it was not very packed with PRs. However, the top of the charts were very active, so they will be getting a lot of mention in this update.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>No new players this week. <br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br><font color=red>1-11</font><br>Two players were active in the top 10 this week, and there was a battle at the borderline for position! That's always fun to watch.<br><font color=yellow>#5 Jay Batten</font> was the highest ranked PR player this week. He did something I have not seen in a long, long time for this level of play. He PR'ed 19 times and cut over 2 AF. That is crazy, Jay, keep it up. He has sufficiently distanced himself from 6th place, but now has a large gap to face before challenging Marc Bas in 4th. <br>The highlight of the top 10 battle was between <font color=yellow>#10 Mark Schmidt</font> and <font color=yellow>#11 Jimmy Benson</font>. These two sit within .15 AF of each other, and both are about to overtake Dustin Enders and Jak Russo. Will this duel turn into a battle? We'll find out next week!<br><br><font color=red>12-20</font><br>I promised that the top players were the most active this week, and I mean it! Four more players were active in this 9 player range. They are all close and fighting for position!<br><font color=yellow>#13 Tony Ruiz</font> did work this week by submitting 3 PRs and solidifying his position on the chart. He's got a bit of a ways to go until 12th, but he may want to watch his back with the battle going on with <font color=yellow>#15 Alex Shoal, #17 Matthieu Mayer</font> and <font color=yellow>#18 Alvin Le</font>. All four of these players range under 3 AF points and all were active. Matthieu Mayer though looks to be the one to watch, as he PR'ed 14 times, cut 2 players forward, and made a 4 AF cut: a much larger gain than the other three made.<br><font color=red>21-50</font><br><font color=yellow>#26 Fabien Jacques</font> made good progress this week with 3 PRs. He moved up a place from 27th.<br><font color=yellow>#31 Paul-Philippe Baehr</font> had perhaps the most impressive progress in this range, with 12 PRs and 3 players passed.<br><font color=yellow>#32 John Brunn</font> is now right behind Baehr. He passed Robert van Zanten this week with a PR. <br><font color=yellow>#34 Lucas Acek</font> follows right behind as well. He PR'ed 4 times and passed two players this week. Nice work to him.<br>And our last active player in the top 50 is <font color=yellow>#43 Marvin Donjes</font> who made 2 PRs this week and passed just as many players. Nice activity guys!<br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br>And, like I said earlier, the front was clearly the active portion of this news update. Although the 51-100 range makes up half the top 100 (obviously), only 5 players were active in it, and only 1 I would consider made any significant move. Either way, here were the actives!<br><font color=yellow>#54 Bob Holden</font> is the guy with the progress. He made 12 PRs this week and cut in front of 6 players on the ladder. Well done to him!<br><font color=yellow>#76 Danny Gallenberger</font> passed 1 player this week with 2 PRs.<br><font color=yellow>#97 Kevin Borne</font> made 4 PRs this week, and may soon be dueling with our newest top 100 entry <font color=yellow>#98 Sam Smith</font>. Sam also made 4 PRs this week, but passed 3 players this week compared to Borne's 1. Nice to see activity out at this barrier. :)<br><br><font color=red>101-Timbuktu</font><br><font color=yellow>#104 Viktor Silivanov</font> is the farthest away from the famous city in Mali, Africa this week in this range of players. He made 6 PRs and cut in front of a player. Good luck to him and his journey of 4-5 AF points left to reach the top 100!<br>Nothing happens here for a long time as I scroll down the stat sheet... ah. <br><font color=yellow>#152 Tonny Su</font> is the next player active, and what a gap of inactives! Ah well, they must all be near the top now. Keep up your good work Tonny. (He made 9 PRs and passed 2 players this week.)<br>Our second to last significant active player is <font color=yellow>#249 Julian Stephens</font>. For some reason, I feel like I mention that name a lot. Maybe I do, maybe I don't. Anyway, he made 4 PRs and cut 7 spots forward this week. Good job on making it into the top 250!<br>Our last active is way down on the list this week. It is <font color=yellow>#342 Stephen de Winter</font>. I'm not sure how he did it, but he submitted 22 PRs and only passed 1 player. Maybe it's because it's summer and he plays best in the cold? I don't know. Anyway, congrats on making the news update and making me wonder....<br><br><font color=cyan>New Site Records</font><br><font color=yellow>Matthieu Mayer </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows crs</font> time of 1'15\"964 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'15\"863</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'09\"236 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"174</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Working out with Web right now who's doing awards.

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, sorry for the one day delay but I was busy yesterday. The karter turnout was better than usual (at least for my weeks), with almost 40 players hitting the controllers. There is still a hidden batch of you guys that have decided not to play. Shame on you all. Anyway, let's get down to it.<br><br>This news update covers July 17th to July 23rd, 2011.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Just one noob this week.<br><font color=lime>Alexandre Agniel</font> sent in 32 times. I think I might just stop mentioning people who don't send in flaps, and then this site will get a mass submission of every player's flap time. He's 231st right now, so a Top 150 finish may be in store with the rest of those times in (if they ever come in)<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>38 people decided to send in their MKW submissions this week, about the average.<br><br> “Welcome to the AF chart” goes out to nobody. I'm done here now. No long rant about those people who haven't submitted their times, because frankly they don't listen well.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>The Top 10 has been kind of sad recently. Nobody is playing, or at least regularly 7 players aren't playing. That's good for everyone else but kind of depressing for this paragraph. A big shocker is that <font color=yellow>#5 Jay Batten</font> was playing. He sent in 12 PRs and cut .79 AF points. He's under the 19 AF barrier and is now 4.7 AF points away from #4 Marc Bas. The other guy that was playing decided to continue the most exciting country battle in MKW's history. <font color=yellow>#8 Mark Schmidt </font> sent in 3 PRs, 2 of them being the CM glitch times, and earned himself the distinction of German MKW Champion again. He cut .9 AF points and jumped from #11 to distance himself 1.5 AF points from Dustin Enders. Dustin should pop up in a week or so with 50 or so new PRs, so Mark has to stay vigilant and at the controller. <br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Five players were active here, which is a nice number for the amount that are in the group. <font color=yellow>#13 Cole Gilbert</font>, #3 MK Combined was at the helm this week, sending in 7 PRs and moving from #14 up one place. He cut 3.21 AF points and again proved he's never done with this game. Ever. Directly after him is <font color=yellow>#14 Tony Ruiz</font>, who lost the spot to Cole this week. Sending in 2 new PRs that are both SRs probably makes up for it though, and a 1.18 AF cut can't hurt. Next spot down is <font color=yellow>#15 Alex Shoal</font>, who had one PR to knock off a little AF, but it was swallowed up by the other players and he gained about .3 this week. <font color=yellow>#23 Salvatore Bellusci</font> played as well but his activity was minimal, 2 PRs and a gain of AF. Nice thing is he moved up a place since he gained less than #49 Artur Bauer. <font color=yellow>#25 Fabien Jacques</font> sent in 3 PRs, moved up one spot and cut .96 AF. A nice week for him. <br> <br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#28 John Brunn</font> starts things off in this group. He had a great week as usual, with 6 PRs and a 2.56 AF cut, bringing him up four spots from #32. It wouldn't surprise me if by next week he'll be featured in the Top 25. <font color=yellow>#34 Liam Ashcroft</font> didn't cut AF as usual this week, but with 3 PRs and moving up a place (he gained less), it can't be viewed as a loss at all. <font color=yellow>#36 Oliver Martin</font> was back moving up one place with 2 PRs and a 1.02 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#39 Zane Royal</font> used his epic white rMR pipes to kart his way to 6 PRs and a .39 AF cut. The big highlight was the move from 41st place. <font color=yellow>#43 Matthias Sempels</font> had a 2.48 AF cut with 3 PRs, and moved up a place himself. <font color=yellow>#44 Marvin Donjes</font> is quickly proving himself as a force in MKW lore. He had a 4 PR, 1.00 AF week, but dropped a place due to Matthias' superior move. Closing out the group is the pair of <font color=yellow>#47 Bob Holden and #48 Franco Gubser</font>, although one outshined the other. Bob had 17 PRs, a 9.02 AF cut, and moved all the way from #54. Franco hit 2 PRs to move from #51 with a 3.17 AF cut. Brandon Sansui and Tim van Ham are the victims of the move, as they leave the Top 50 and drop to the depths below.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>A karter looking to leave this group as he sees fellow competitors drop around him is <font color=yellow>#52 Sebastian Kovats</font>, who had 5 PRs and a 4.37 AF cut that moved him up three spots. <font color=yellow>#64 Ross Coleman</font> had a 4 PR week, but gained AF. <font color=yellow>#70 Danny Gallenberger</font> continued the forward progress by hitting 10 PRs and cutting 6.51 AF points to move from #76 up 6 places. <font color=yellow>#73 Stacy Needham</font> had a 4 PR, 2.64 AF cut week that drove him up a spot. The biggest mover here is <font color=yellow>#78 Dave Tandy</font>, who had 22 PRs and moved from #83 with a 12.51 AF cut. He's been very active on the CM glitch discovery but found time to play other courses as well. Nice work! <font color=yellow>#82 Sofie Wimmer</font>, female #2 cut 5 AF points exactly with 7 PRs, but couldn't change her ranking. She did pass Dan Boettcher but Dave Tandy's move negated that progress. <font color=yellow>#84 Andre Hoelscher</font> had 13 PRs to jump from #94 with a 7.10 AF cut. Combined MK #2 <font color=yellow>#88 Michael Fried</font> continued his progress as he PRed 2 times and moved up 4 spots with a 3.71 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#92 Kevin Borne</font> was playing with 5 PRs and a 2.18 AF cut. He moved from #97 and is securing his spot in the Top 100. Closing out the group is the pair of <font color=yellow>#97 Viktor Silvanov and #98 Sam Smith</font>, each with different stories. Viktor moved from #104 with 9 PRs and a 7.21 AF cut, and Sam sadly gained AF with 1 PR, although jumped Kevin Letailleur to negate Viktor's move. Dropped from the Top 100 this week is Virgil Blondel, a few weeks after he entered. Such is the harsh backlash of MKW.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-END~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#106 Fintan Kelly</font>, official MKW hero and bringer of the separate charts had 24 PRs and cut 26.15 AF points, moving all the way from #124. <font color=yellow>#117 Sophie Steiner</font> had 3 PRs and cut 1.29 AF points off her score, and impressive outing. <font color=yellow>#125 Cyril Fulag</font> had 5 PRs, a 1.32 AF cut, and moved up 3 spots. <font color=yellow>#147 Christian Wild</font>, #1 MK Combined and the guy that doesn't know the definition of inactive played with 1 PR, however gained AF. <font color=yellow>#178 Will Eudy</font> had 2 PRs and cut 6.98 AF points, moving up three spots. <font color=yellow>#184 Murray Wright</font> had 18 PRs, moved from #218 up a bunch of spots with a 29 point AF cut. <br><br>Movement outside the Top 200 was <font color=yellow>#239 Julien Stephens</font> -12.39 AF and a move from #249. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Due to finally allowing the new Coconut Mall glitch times onto the charts, a bunch of people got their times sent in. This resulted in the largest amount of people I've seen breaking a SR in one week, a grand total of 20 people got in on the action with flap and course times. I would list them all here, but I think you can all just check out the charts and see for yourselves. However, the final victor was Tony Ruiz, who grabbed his second and third SRs by taking both CM glitch WRs. By dropping Marc Bas one SR, Marc and Tony are tied for 5th on the charts. The other big loser was Andrew Grieve, who dropped from T-5th to T-10th, down to 2 SRs now.<br><br>On a happy note, we subbed both 69 and 68 minutes for total course and flap time!

Awarded for 18 PRs, a 3.54 AF cut, and moving back into the Top 10 and taking the German crown. <br>2nd July POW - <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font> stole the show again with his 19 PRs and 2.5 AF cut. The 11% score reduction helped him start to bridge the huge gap to 4th place. <br>3rd July POW - No one in the Top 70 had a cut over 3% on their AF, so <font color=yellow>Danny Gallenberger</font> wins this award. He had 8 PRs and moved from 76th to 72nd with over 3 AF cut and a 3.5% move.<br><br>~Web</p>",

To those of you who may not know yet, another glitch was found recently on Mario Circuit. Mario Circuit can now be found on the new non-glitch times on our site. Otherwise, you can submit your times to the combined charts to Tree Circuit.<br><br>Nah I'm kidding. It's still universally known as Mario Circuit, so keep calling it MC in your submissions. But I'm not kidding about the separate charts! Non-glitch charts have at long last been added to the site. You should see them on the left tabs in red. There is no AF charts with them yet though. But at least the non-glitch times people achieve are being accounted for. <br><br>So yeah. That's what's up. On the forums many new WRs have been discussed the past couple of weeks, and one I would like to mention in particular here. <br><br><img src=http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk277/NMeade94/ee60e8e2.png></img><br><br>This is the first World Record to sub 1'52 on Wario's Gold Mine by <font color=yellow>Nick Meade</font>. This is quite the achievement, and the run is equally impressive. Be sure to watch it sometime if you haven't. Congrats to our former Site Champion on this great time! We may see a battle for this WR too in the coming days, as <font color=yellow>Marco van Turner</font> accomplished a 1'52\"041 PR himself, and <font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney</font> scored a time just barely slower with promising splits.<br><br>So great job on the activity these weeks guys! The Mario Kart Wii forum rarely goes longer than 20 minutes without a new post. Lots of new TASes, vids, PRs, MKWii challenges, site issues and work for the separate charts, and more going on, and it's been entertaining to watch. <br><br>Now on to the movement and news. <font color=red>This news update covers the activity from July 24th to August 6th.</font><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br><br>4 new players these last two weeks! Please welcome:<br><br><font color=purple>Dennis Antonov, Jason Crab, David Berger, and Will Dykstra</font> to the site!<br><br><font color=red>~Movement~</font><br><br>36 players were active the past two weeks in total. The activity was relatively proportionate, and it had its definitely motivated players and not-so-motivated players. I guess some people felt more of an urge than others to survive the coming zombie apocalypse. <br><br><img src=http://www.medievalarchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/dover_castle.jpg></img><br><br>This is the structure that <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney, #4 Marc Bas, and #5 Jay Batten</font> are defending themselves in, along with the other members of the top 20. They are miles away from the center of the zombie epicenter, and all three are battling to reach the most inward chamber in the fortress, which is currently occupied by Jorge Hernandez. The fortress is armed by their many servants, who wield high powered machine guns and hand grenades, which represent their many strong PRs. The zombies have a long, hard battle to fight if they want to even come close to these three. <font color=yellow>#13 Tony Ruiz</font> is a bit closer to the outer walls, but he added some weapons to his arsenal this week with his three PRs, and forced Cole Gilbert to trade with him and take his slightly less well-protected position. <font color=yellow>#15 Alex Shoal</font> got some more ammo this week too with his PR. And facing the gate to the fortress with several hand grenades on hand as well as many 1-up mushrooms is <font color=yellow>#19 Fabien Jacques</font>. This guy barged in the fortress the other day with a tank of PRs so strong that no one dared deny him access. He moved from #25 this week to this new position. Very impressive on his part. <br><br>Well done on being so prepared in that castle guys.<br><br><img src=http://blogs.reuters.com/oddly-enough//files/2010/03/cr_mega_424_tanks-1-490.jpg></img><br><br>These are the pilgrims of the 21st to 50th position on the AF ladder. They have PRed enough to earn themselves tanks, but some have a much farther journey than others to reach the fortress of the top 20. Let's see who put their tank in gear these weeks and moved further from the encroaching threat. <br><br><font color=yellow>#27 John Brunn</font> led the way this week, though he barely pressed the accelerator. Still, it was enough to pass a fellow tanker and get closer to the fortress nonetheless. <br><br><font color=yellow>#34 Liam Ashcroft</font> also moved forward a bit, with his 5 PRs and slight AF cut. He's in good shape still to avoid the zombies, but you can't be too safe these days. Keep moving soldier.<br><br><font color=yellow>#38 Zane Royal</font> PRed four times, but he must have stopped at a gas station or a fast food restaurant or something, because he still only cut .3 AF. Oh well. He's still considerably far away from the zombies too. <br><br><font color=yellow>#43 Bob Holden</font> tied with <font color=yellow>#43 Matthias Sempels</font> for this AF spot. However, it looks as if Holden will in the end Hold the spot , as he made a 6 point AF cut this week. Pretty impressive. Matthias was still active though with his 2 PRs.<br><br><img src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7H2bweFNR8k/TOALP6wygWI/AAAAAAAAA00/m2ASzrmD8_Y/s1600/idf-infantry.jpg></img.<br><br>This is the group of people who have not upgraded to a tank yet. However, you can tell from that guy in the front that his grin is his looking forward to the reward soon. Most people are found in this infantry; a good 100 in fact. This section will cover the work actions of those in the 51st - 150th positions. <br><br>The guy in the front is <font color=yellow>#53 Sebastian Kovats</font>. He is literally inches from his tank upgrade. He only needs .7 of an AF cut to cover the rest of the gap into the top 50.<br><br>Two players a bit farther down decided to do some double time this week, and they passed 4 people and 7 people respectively: <font color=yellow>#60 Ross Coleman and #62 Danny Gallenberger</font>. Both definitely made nice AF cuts, but they still have about 13 more AF cut to go before passing into the top 50. Keep marching!<br><br><font color=yellow>#78 Dave Tandy</font> made a 3 point AF cut or so this week too. He's almost caught up to the group of players in front of him now, so although he can see the zombies in the horizon behind him, it looks like maybe he'll pass them and let the zombies take them out first. Not far behind Dave is <font color=yellow>#84 Sebastian Wimmer</font>, who made 14 PRs this week. With a pair of binoculars, I think Wimmer should be able to make out the first distorted zombie face behind him. <br><br><font color=yellow>#89 Kevin Borne</font> was also active this week, although it was just 2 PRs from him. However, he cut about 100 people on average for those two PRs, giving him a nice 2.7 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#95 Sam Smith</font> and <font color=yellow>#107</font>Noah Gordon also made 2 PRs this week, although they didn't cut as much as Kevin did. *NStride wonders if this is a group that decided to play MC.<br><br><font color=yellow>#108 David Schiering</font> had an impressive couple weeks with his 6 PRs. Although it was just 6 PRs, he still cut 12 AF and passed 11 players. Not bad at all. Hopefully he didn't hitchhike on the TAS plane to \"fame\". Pretty unlikely I think, as there are few airports so close to the zombies there, and the planes usually fly farther than 11 spots.<br><br> <font color=yellow>#121 Cyril Fulag</font> was pretty close to the zombies, and he knew it. They were only a few hundred yards away from him in 125th, so he PRed 13 times and cut 7 AF to keep them at bay. Don't give up the fight!<br><br><font color=red><font size=13>The Zombies</font></font><br><br><img src=http://www.pr-squared.com/demon-zombie.jpg></img><br><br>That's in other words, those under 151st place. And that includes your very own news writer, <font color=yellow>#152 Zack Weber</font>! He is on the verge of being not a zombie, but it will come at the cost of turning another player into one. And of course there will be the usual bloody fight over it too. His 1 PR is not very promising though. <br><br>Farther along in the ranks of the zombies are <font color=yellow>#174 Will Eudy, #178 Murray Wright, and #185 Tony Fan</font>. All three of them made nice cuts this week, but especially Murray did with his 21 point AF cut. They may be zombies, but they're definitely coming after the rest of you!<br><br><font color=yellow>#197 Sean Wilson</font> made it into the top 200 this update, so congrats to him. His 11 point AF cut was enough to pass some odd 13 players. A bit farther down is our pretty much final mentions for this week. They are <font color=yellow>#230 Daniel Crutcher</font> (nice last name for a zombie, no?) and <font color=yellow>#234 Julian Stephens</font>. They are still zombies, and they have a long way to go to find the cure. <br><br>Our welcome to the Zombie-Chart award though goes to <font color=red>#386 David Berger</font>. This guy joins the higher ranks of the zombies, because with an entry that low he probably isn't terribly interested in curing himself. We could be proven wrong, but he is not far from the king of the zombies, our last place AF player Peter Ferguson, so he might have connections with him. Oh well, welcome anyway! <br><br><font color=cyan>New Site Records</font><br>As of this update, 2 new Site Records were updated, although I am sure there are quite a few more. Anyway, congrats to those who got updated. Specifically...<br><br><font color=yellow>Dave Tandy </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall lap</font> time of 0'05\"636 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'05\"624</font><br><font color=yellow>Zane Royal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway crs</font> time of 1'42\"109 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'41\"986</font><br><br><br>And... I think that covers everything! Sorry this news update was long in coming. Hope you were duly entertained though, and peace out. :)<br><br>~NStride</p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hello, Mario Kart Wii Players' Page. This is your new writer, MrL1193, here. As you've probably heard, Andy has been extremely busy with school lately, and since Web has finally taken his well-earned retirement, Andy asked me if I could help with the news updates. I'll be flying solo for now, but we'll be trying to find a suitable alternate writer for the future, so expect to see another new face sometime soon.<br><br>This update will pick up right where the last one left off, covering activity from <font color=red>August 6th to October 9th</font>. Expect a rather large wall of text, as there's been a lot of activity of late to report.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br><br>19 players joined the site in these past 9 weeks. Please welcome <font color=lime>Stephen L, Andrew Catapana, Phillipp Helmers, Andre Morales, Brandon Pata, Abraham Pagan, Alexis Lesieur, Martin Blue, Ryu Yuki, Steven Ly, Matthew Everitt, Mikel Nelson, Zubin J, Florian Truetschel, Stefan Glosby, Adam Frederick, Max Reese, Declan Haines,</font> and <font color=lime>Jason Weekes</font>. Of these 19, only 4 joined with full timesheets and will be pointed out later.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br><br>131 players sent in their times during the gap in news updating. Due to the sheer number of active players, I can't possibly mention everyone, so only the highest-ranked players are guaranteed recognition for activity.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Starting at the top, <font color=yellow>Champion Jorge Hernandez</font> submitted 3 PR's these past two months. It wasn't enough to actually lower his AF, but it did fend off a heavy hit from the players taking advantage of the new Mario Circuit and Coconut Mall glitches, which could have pushed his AF into the double digits for the first time in quite a while. <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font> defended himself likewise but also added a few PR's on other tracks for a total of 7. It still wasn't enough to overcome the AF deficit, though, and he actually took more of a hit than Jorge. Continuing the trend, <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> submitted 9 times including Mario Circuit and Coconut Mall times and also failed to cut AF. He did, however, creep closer to Nick; Shaun has been closing the gap for some time now, so a pass could happen in the future. <font color=yellow>#4 Jay Batten</font> was the one to break the losing streak; he submitted a whopping 30 PR's to knock more than 2 full points off his AF and pass <font color=yellow>#5 Marc Bas</font>, who PR'ed twice but still lost a lot of ground on the new glitch tracks. <font color=yellow>#6 Jak Russo</font> made an impressive 15 PR's and cut more than 4 points of AF, enough to shoot past 3 players--a big move considering he was already in the Top 10. Rounding out the activity in the Top 10 are the German duo <font color=yellow>#8 Dustin Enders</font> and <font color=yellow>#9 Mark Schmidt</font>. The two have been dueling for the title of German Champ for many months now, and for the moment, Dustin is on top by a slim .1875 lead. He submitted 17 PR's, 3 more than Mark's 14, and passed both Mark and retired former champion Bubbles. Mark cut a bit of AF, but not nearly as much as Dustin; he surely hasn't given up the fight yet, however.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Just outside the Top 10, there was quite a lot of movement going on. <font color=yellow>#11 Tony Ruiz</font> made his bid for fame and moved up two spots. He sent in 11 PR's, the same number as his new rank. <font color=yellow>#13 Tyler Mcnell</font> was one of Tony's victims; with 18 PR's, there was no shortage of new times on Tyler's part, but he still lost AF and 1 position. <font color=yellow>#14 Alex Shoal</font> moved up one rank with 6 PR's and a decent .8 cut. <font color=yellow>#15 Thomas van Deerse</font> made a particularly big jump with 30 PR's, moving up 7 places and cutting 17.6% off his AF. <font color=yellow>#16 Cole Gilbert</font> submitted 2 PR's but lost ground and two positions to Alex and Thomas. <font color=yellow>#17 Alvin Le</font> and <font color=yellow>#18 Fabien Jacques</font> submitted 8 and 9 PR's respectively and moved in tandem, each cutting AF and passing one player to remain together. A few places down, Irish Champ <font color=yellow>#21 Daniel Raftery</font> made a big jump with 17 PR's and a cut of more than 7 AF, gaining 8 places. <font color=yellow>#22 Artur Bauer</font> also had quite a few PR's to send in--12, to be exact. He moved up 3 places with his improvements. Swedish Champ <font color=yellow>#23 Eric Hacksell</font> submitted just 1 PR; it mitigated his AF backslide by almost 1 AF, so it must have been a pretty good PR. And finishing off this section, <font color=yellow>#24 John Brunn</font> nabbed a solid 16 PR's and moved up 3 spots with a 2.6 AF cut, while <font color=yellow>#25 Salvatore Bellusci</font> did what he could with 11 PR's but still lost a position and some ground in AF. Former champion Alvin van Asselt was forced out of this group as a result of all the movement, though he did have some new times to report.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>To try to limit the length of this update, from this point on, I'll only be mentioning those who made some sort of positive movement, either in AF or in position, or made some supreme effort in getting new PR's.<br><font color=yellow>#29 Liam Ashcroft</font> is the first in this group to meet this requirement; he PR'ed 9 times for a solid 2.5 AF cut, gaining 5 positions. <font color=yellow>#30 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> was pushed back by Liam's move, but he forged ahead with 8 PR's and managed a net gain of 2 places. <font color=yellow>#31 Mickael Smolen</font> submitted 5 PR's and cut a bit of AF. This would have been enough to gain some places, but due to the leaps of the players around him, he stayed right where he was. <font color=yellow>#34 Lucas Acek</font> made 8 PR's; his AF number still increased, but not as much as his neighbors' did, so he moved up one spot. <font color=yellow>#36 Zane Royal</font>, currently #6 in 3-Laps, set 15 new times and moved up two places with a small AF cut. With more effort put into his flaps, he could become a serious contender in the overall Top 10. <font color=yellow>#38 Bob Holden</font> also got 15 PR's, but cut more than 3 AF and gained 5 ranks. Glitchmeister <font color=yellow>#40 Marvin Donjes</font> has been hard at work on the new Coconut Mall and Mario Circuit glitches ever since they came out; he still found time to muster a total of 13 PR's though, enough to knock off a decent amount of AF and pass 5 players. Next up, we have a newcomer to the full AF rankings, <font color=green>#43 Marvin Steven Eckhardt</font>. He finally got around to filling out his timesheet, submitting 63 PR's and joining at fairly impressive rank, to the annoyance of the 362 players below him. <font color=yellow>#47 Clement Rouchon</font> had the biggest jump out of the players in this group; he submitted a set of 29 PR's and rocketed up 21 places, latching onto the tail end of the Top 50. Kyle R ends this section, with a strong 19 PR showing that was just enough to gain 5 places and secure a spot in this group, leaving Franco Gubser just barely hanging on to the group with slight activity.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Starting off the next group down, we have <font color=yellow>#51 Alberto Fiorese</font>. His 9 PR's weren't enough to keep him from being knocked out of the group above, but he did cut almost 1 point of AF. The next karter who has something positive to show for his efforts is Wheeler <font color=yellow>#57 Danny Gallenberger</font>. With his solid 18 PR's, he made a move of 5 places, cutting almost 7 points of AF. Passing over another inactive karter, we come across one of the rare Japanese players on the rankings, <font color=yellow>#59 Harp Valentine</font>. His 6 PR's were enough to cut 1.8 AF and keep him in place in the rankings. <font color=yellow>#65 Dave Tandy</font> has been making impressive strides lately. Like Marvin up above, Dave has been hard at work on the new glitch tracks, but he also managed to make a very solid cut, shedding 11.8 AF and moving up 13 places. <font color=yellow>#69 Nate Paternost</font> was one of the karters Dave passed, but Nate made a solid cut of his own, with 12 PR's and a 7 place move despite initially being set back by Dave. <font color=yellow>#73 Simone Bertini's</font> 14 PR's were enough to cut a few points of AF and gain one rank. Next up is a karter who's been playing since the release of the game, <font color=yellow>#78 David Schiering</font>. A former site champion, David apparently decided to start playing again, and has submitted 30 PR's over these past two months, yielding a fantastic 30 place move back into the Top 100 and a 34.0000 AF cut. That's a 23.6831% cut, more than anyone else in this news update. Nice comeback, David! Next we have another player with a freshly filled out timesheet, <font color=green>#86 Sean Owens</font>. His 13 new times were enough to net him a relatively comfortable position in the Top 100, and he seems ready to work his way up further. <font color=yellow>#88 Sam Smith</font> and <font color=yellow>#89 Viktor Silivanov</font> made sizable moves toward the newcomer, Sam moving 7 places with 15 PR's and Viktor moving 9 places with 19 PR's. Both of them avoided being narrowly pushed out of the Top 100 with their activity. And finally, <font color=yellow>#92 Alex Vandegrift</font> did likewise with 28 PR's; however, he only cut about half as much AF and so only moved up 5 spots. It hardly seems fair, but since he's still in the Top 100, he probably isn't too jealous.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-405~~</font><br>This section, being the largest, saw a lot of AF cuts from the players as usual, so I'll only be pointing out new guys and the players who actually gained positions. The first of these is <font color=yellow>#102 Noah Gordon</font>. With his 12 PR's, he climbed 5 places closer to the Top 100, and may very soon actually make it back in. <font color=yellow>#107 Loris Bagnasco</font> also climbed 5 places, but he demonstrated his superior efficiency by doing so with only 5 PR's and actually cutting more AF than Cutz. <font color=yellow>#109 Martin Prigent</font> worked his way toward the Top 100 as well, with 11 PR's and 10 places gained. And just a bit lower, <font color=yellow>#112 Luke Berrill</font> pulled out 23 PR's for a 14 position jump. There's quite a bit of potential outside the Top 100; a lot of these guys have been in the Top 100 before, and I wouldn't be surprised to see them in it again before long. <font color=yellow>#117 Jamal Fluellen</font> is on his way up as well; with his 16 PR's, he passed 6 more karters on his way to the Top 100. <font color=yellow>#119 Marco van Turner</font> made a sizable cut as well, with 25 PR's and a 12 place improvement, and <font color=yellow>#125 David Lee</font> was up 16 places with 13 PR's. <font color=yellow>#132 Tom Norton</font> found time in between Banana Cup improvements to amass 17 PR's and gain 24 positions. If he ever manages to fully balance his timesheet, he'll be a force to be reckoned with. <font color=yellow>#135 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> reported 13 PR's, enough for an 8 place cut. Further down, <font color=yellow>#149 Tonny Su</font> managed 9 PR's and cut 4 places, while <font color=yellow>#151 Will Eudy</font> sent in a whopping 45 for a 23 rank improvement, leaving Combined Rankings champ Christian Wild sandwiched in between them. <font color=yellow>#161 Jose Karica</font>, unlike the other guys mentioned here, didn't cut AF. However, his 5 PR's slowed his descent enough for him to pass 2 people, so he gets mentioned as well. <font color=yellow>#171 Eric Shore</font> sent in an impressive 43 PR's and moved up 18 positions. Hot on his heels is <font color=yellow>#174 Nicola Torre</font>, the biggest mover this update just going by ranks gained and AF cut; he only needed 20 PR's to cut 43.6 AF and 33 places. <font color=yellow>#175 Murray Wright</font> gained 3 places with 5 PR's, while <font color=yellow>#179 Sean Wilson</font> jumped 18 places with 40 PR's. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#200 Daniel Crutcher</font> made the third-largest cut of this update, with 34 PR's, 31.3 AF cut, and a 30 place move. It's not as easy to make big cuts like these in the upper ranges, so enjoy them while you can. <font color=yellow>#222 Dave Johnston</font> made 23 PR's and improved by 6 positions, while <font color=yellow>#231 Julian Stephens</font> got 16 PR's and improved by 3 positions. These guys have been diligently working their way up through the ranks for quite a while now; it shouldn't be long now before they break into the Top 200. Continuing down the ranks, we come to a series of newcomers to the AF chart and newcomers to the site as a whole: <font color=green>#233 Luke Allen,</font> <font color=lime>#248 Florian Truetschel,</font> <font color=green>#266 Iacopo Sorce,</font> <font color=lime>#303 Mikel Nelson,</font> and <font color=lime>#349 Max Reese</font>. Hopefully, we'll soon see some activity in the lower ranks from these guys; only time will tell. Down close to the bottom, we now come to the last active non-newbie: <font color=yellow>#370 David Berger</font>. If nothing else, this guy definitely deserves some sort of recognition for effort, as he improved 62 out of his 64 times in these past two months. He cut just over 30 AF and 16 positions, not as many positions as those guys in the tighter-packed 100's, but still a commendable effort indeed. Keep it up, David! Finally, to end it all, we have newbie <font color=lime>#391 Stefan Glosby</font>. He joins quite close to the bottom, but with diligent effort, he could make some big cuts down here.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>A whole bunch of Site Records fell during the past two months, and there was a flurry of activity on the recently glitched Mario Circuit. Each of the two records was claimed by 20-30 different people at various times before finally coming to rest as detailed below. On the Site Records table, Daniel Raftery gained one to move into a three-way tie for 3rd with 4 records; Marvin Donjes leaped from 0 to 2 records, tied for eighth; and Rhys Ogle, Yu Nakano, and Daniel Crutcher all appeared on the table with 1 each. Tom Norton and Dave Tandy each traded 1 record for another, Sword remaining tied for 6th with 3 and Silver remaining tied for 13th with 1. The losers were Marc Bas, who lost 1 and dropped to tied 8th with 2; Cole Gilbert, Tony Ruiz, and Andrew Grieve, who each lost 1 and dropped to tied 13th with 1; Alex Shoal, who gained 1 but lost 2 and also ended up with just 1; and Aziz Abdullah, who, through the technicalities of updating, lost his only record and dropped off the table.<br><br><font color=yellow>Dave Tandy </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'21\"764 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'05\"218</font><br><font color=yellow>Marvin Donjes </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit lap</font> time of 0'25\"325 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"749</font><br><font color=yellow>Marvin Donjes </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'44\"375 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'44\"318</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Crutcher </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall lap</font> time of 0'05\"624 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'05\"607</font><br><font color=yellow>Ethan McCormac </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font> time of 0'35\"377 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"358</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'13\"114 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'13\"097</font><br><font color=yellow>Zane Royal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway crs</font> time of 1'41\"986 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'41\"732</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square crs</font> time of 2'05\"303 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'05\"167</font><br><font color=yellow>Yu Nakano </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills crs</font> time of 1'35\"317 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'35\"269</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Raftery </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 crs</font> time of 1'58\"856 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'58\"615</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 DK's Jungle Parkway crs</font> time of 2'12\"401 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'12\"318</font><br><font color=yellow>Rhys Ogle </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain crs</font> time of 2'06\"862 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'06\"858</font><br><br>Unfortunately, I don't currently have access to the non-SC stats, so I can't comment on those.

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, MrL1193 here, bringing you your weekly news update. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary happened this week, so I'll just get to the news without delay.<br><br>This update covers October 9th to October 16th, which is in fact a period of 7 days and not 8 according to the stats program. Hopefully this will solve the problem of missing days in the updates.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Three new challengers appeared this week.<br><font color=lime>Jason Belles</font> joined with the typical 32 times. His course-only timesheet tentatively ranks him at 403rd for now.<br><font color=lime>Samuel Laryea</font> sent in just 5 times, which is still better than nothing. He would theoretically be ranked just above Jason at 402nd if their other times were all ranked last.<br><font color=lime>Michael Miller</font> was the most promising of the rookies. His 32 times (which, oddly, consisted of 31 courses and a flap) place him at 264th, which isn't bad for only half a timesheet. Hopefully he'll send in the rest of his times soon.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>A scant 27 players were active this week, which is bad news for Mario Kart Wii but good news for those who did play, as they get more of the spotlight and less of the AF backsliding. Let's see who they were.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>European champion <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> was the highest-ranked active player this week. With his 2 PR's, he cut a little bit of AF and continues inching toward Nick. <font color=yellow>#8 Mark Schimdt</font> was the only other active player here. He PR'ed 3 times and gained a position, taking his German crown back from Dused. No doubt Dused will show up again a month from now with 16 hoarded PR's, so Mark shouldn't relax just yet.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Though there wasn't much movement here, the activity level was somewhat higher in this group than all the rest this week, as one third of the players were active. <font color=yellow>#14 Alex Shoal</font> was the first of these, chipping away at the roughly 3.5 AF gap in front of him with 2 PR's. Right behind him is Dutch champion <font color=yellow>#15 Thomas van Deerse</font>, who closed the gap between them this week by PR'ing thrice rather than twice. <font color=yellow>#18 Fabien Jacques</font> also claimed 2 PR's, but he too has a bit of empty space to climb through before he can rank up. <font color=yellow>#23 Salvatore Bellusci</font> was the only player in this group to move; he sent in 5 PR's to cut nearly 2.4 AF, leapingfrogging 2 karters. <font color=yellow>#24 John Brunn</font> would have gained a place with his 4 PR's and a 1.9 AF cut, but because of Dashi, he stayed put.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Just outside the Top 25, we come to <font color=yellow>#26 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font>, whose name always makes me double-check my spelling. With an impressive 12 PR's, he made a strong cut of almost 5 AF and climbed over 4 players. <font color=yellow>#30 Liam Ashcroft</font> was one of his victims; Lash cut AF with 2 PR's but got stepped on by Paul and fell back a spot. <font color=yellow>#38 Marvin Steven Eckhardt</font> joined the full AF chart only recently and he shows no signs of slowing; with 11 PR's this week, he jumped 5 places and cut nearly 4 AF. Among the karters he passed were <font color=yellow>#40 Marvin Donjes</font> and <font color=yellow>#43 Matthias Sempels</font>; Marvin managed to hold his position with 3 PR's, but Matthias could only manage 1, and lost both a position and some ground in AF.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Considering that this section contains twice as many players as the last one, you'd expect to find more active players here. However, only a meager 2 karters were active this week. Those two were <font color=yellow>#56 Harp Valentine</font> and <font color=yellow>#58 Danny Gallenberger</font>. Harp made a nice 3 place move with 5 PR's and 4.5 AF cut, and may soon be leaving this rubbish heap to rot as he moves toward the Top 50. Danny's outlook is a little bleaker, as his 1 PR wasn't enough to overcome the AF deficit and he lost a place to Harp. However, Danny has been gaining positions steadily for quite some time, so he'll probably be able to overcome the setback.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Finally, we come to the last and largest group, which didn't have very many active players either. A few karters here are still struggling upward toward the fabled (yet inactive) Top 100, though; among these is <font color=yellow>#108 Martin Prigent</font>. With 4 new PR's, he managed to move one place closer to the 100 mark. New Zealander <font color=yellow>#127 Dexter Howe</font> also gained one place, but he did it with only 2 PR's and a smaller AF cut. A bit further down, we have a player who's only just finished his timesheet; welcome <font color=white>#147 Martin Blue</font>. He starts off at a respectable rank; time and effort could see him in the Top 100 soon. <font color=yellow>#151 Will Eudy</font> was set back one place by Martin's appearance just above, but he was able to crank out 5 PR's to break even in positions and cut ~1.3 AF. Down in the lower ranks, <font color=yellow>#213 Dave Johnston</font> made an energetic move of 9 places, cutting over 10 AF with 12 PR's. And to finish it all, we have <font color=yellow>#275 Andrea Gardina</font>, who PR'ed thrice but cut less than 1 AF and lost a spot because of Martin. Don't give up, Andrea; with some more work, you'll make some progress yet.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Only one new Site Record this week, but it's a significant one. With the introduction of a new strategy for the Coconut Mall glitch, we finally subbed 51 minutes in total course time. The record in question didn't change hands, though the holder did have to fend off Harp Valentine, Fabien Jacques, Matthias Sempels, and Danny Gallenberger to retain it.<br><br><font color=yellow>Marvin Donjes </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'44\"318 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'40\"515</font><br><br><br><br>Well, that's it for this update. See you next week!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hello, this is your news writer MrL1193 here again with another thrilling report on Mario Kart Wii activity. It'll be a bit short again due to lack of activity, so hopefully the quality of it will compensate.<br><br>This update covers October 16th to October 23rd.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>No new players this week.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Only 20 players were active this week, even less than last week. Hopefully this downward trend won't continue much longer. The good news is that I'll be mentioning everyone who PR'ed this week.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>The Top 10 was quiet this week, with only the sounds of <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney's</font> controller clicking to break the silence. He made 2 PR's but still suffered a net loss in AF, a common curse of the Top 10. He continues to creep closer to inactive Nick, and is expected to make the pass for #2 before long.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Down in the next group, <font color=yellow>#15 Thomas Van Deerse</font> managed a PR but it wasn't enough to cut AF or positions. <font color=yellow>#21 Salvatore Bellusci</font> and <font color=yellow>#22 John Brunn</font> were the winners here, moving in tandem up the ladder. Each gained 2 places with similar AF cuts, Dashi cranking out 6 PR's and JJ nabbing 3.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Comparing the number of PR's to the progress made by the players, things seem to be a bit backwards in this group. <font color=yellow>#32 James Richards</font> overcame the AF treadmill with minimal effort this week, cutting some AF with only 1 PR. And expanding on this theme of efficiency, <font color=yellow>#40 Matthias Sempels</font> cut more than 3 AF and passed 3 players, also with just 1 PR. He accomplished all this by working on Grumble Volcano this week, which just goes to show you how much a single neglected track can bring down your AF. Remember to keep your timesheets balanced, guys! The other active karters here didn't get quite as much satisfaction out of their work. <font color=yellow>#41 Marvin Donjes's</font> 3 PR's just barely saved him from AF backsliding but didn't save him from being knocked down a position by Fisico, while <font color=yellow>#49 Franco Gubser</font> obtained the opposite result with his 3, falling back a bit in AF but gaining a spot to rebound from the brink of the Top 50.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Starting off this group, we have everyone's favorite Wheeler <font color=yellow>#57 Danny Gallenberger</font>. With 3 PR's, he continues to steadily progress toward the Top 50, gaining 1 position and cutting ~1.3 AF. Right in the middle, <font color=yellow>#75 Stacy Needham</font> turned out 6 PR's and also gained 1 place, though his AF cut was just short of a full point. <font color=yellow>#82 Andre Hoelscher</font> sent in 10 PR's for an impressive cut of over 10 AF and jumped 8 places--quite an accomplishment, but not the biggest move this week. No, that recognition goes to <font color=yellow>#91 Martin Blue</font>. After completing his timesheet last week, he sent in 25 more PR's this week for an incredible cut of more than 60 AF, rocketing up 56 places and landing in the Top 100. Assuming it was all done in 1 week, that's some seriously impressive karting work there; just don't forget that sleep is important too, Martin!<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Meanwhile, outside the Top 100, <font color=yellow>#128 Dexter Howe</font> may be left feeling a bit robbed; his ~2.2 AF cut with only 1 PR is the model of efficiency, but he can do little more than shake his fist at Martin as he drops a position to the maniac. <font color=yellow>#136 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> likewise fell victim to the speed demon, his respectable 2 PR's and ~1 AF cut proving insufficient to counter the loss. <font color=yellow>#149 Tonny Su</font> and <font color=yellow>#153 Victor Pavao</font>, on the other hand, didn't feel these effects as they were already behind Martin at the start of the week. Each of them submitted 4 PR's this week, Tonny gaining 1 place and Victor climbing 2. Just behind them, <font color=white>#158 Fabio Sacco</font> filled out his timesheet and joined at a respectable rank. The last active karters this week felt the effects of his appearance, as <font color=yellow>#233 Julian Stephens</font> and <font color=yellow>#372 David Berger</font> each PR'ed and cut a bit of AF but still lost a place to Fabio. Don't get discouraged guys; with more practice and studying videos, you could make the Top 200 in no time!<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>The Site Records front was also quiet this week, with just one new record to report.<br><br><font color=yellow>Marvin Donjes </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'40\"515 and subbed 40 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'39\"903</font><br><br><br>I guess that's it for this update.

        "content": "<p><b>Hello, and Happy Halloween everybody! I hope you're all enjoying your night, whether you're partying, hitting up houses for candy, handing out the candy, or just hiding in bushes waiting to scare the living daylights out of little kids. This update is a bit late because the times updating fell behind this week, but at least it conveniently gives me an excuse to do this on Halloween. I'll be covering the activity from <font color=red>October 23rd - October 31st</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Just one new player this week: <font color=lime>Rob Jon,</font> who joined with a full timesheet.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>33 of our karters played Mario Kart Wii this week--or just got around to sending in their times, I suppose. Let's see who they were.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Starting off, we have the Top 10, who I guess could be considered the VIP's of the big Halloween bash. Apparently, most of them decided to come as ghosts, because there's precious little activity to be seen here. Only <font color=yellow>#2 Shaun Tanney</font> showed signs of life, as he PR'ed 4 times for quite a nice cut of over half a point of AF. With that, he finally passed former long-reigning champion Nick Meade for the #2 spot. Champ Jorge doesn't seem to be afraid, though, as there's still a gulf of 4 points between them.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>In the next group of players, <font color=yellow>#15 Thomas van Deerse</font> PR'ed twice but found himself in the same position as before with slightly more AF. <font color=yellow>#19 John Brunn</font> made progress, however, with 7 PR's yielding a 3 place cut. <font color=yellow>#22 Salvatore Bellusci</font> was none too pleased about this, as he was knocked down a spot, but he still cut AF with 6 PR's.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Several karters were active in this group, but these guys seemed to be having trouble making progress. <font color=yellow>#32 James Richards</font> and <font color=yellow>#36 Zane Royal</font> were two of these unfortunates, each one finding his 1 PR insufficient to cut places or keep from backsliding in AF. <font color=yellow>#39 Marvin Donjes</font> was undaunted, however, as he demonstrated perfect efficiency by cutting 2 places with 2 PR's. <font color=yellow>#49 Franco Gubser</font>, unfortunately, fell victim to the 1 PR curse and lost ground, but cutting losses is still better than nothing, I suppose.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>In contrast to the last group, most of the active players here made big cuts. <font color=yellow>#56 Dave Tandy</font> was the first of these, with 24 PR's earning him a nice 9 place cut. <font color=yellow>#58 Danny Gallenberger</font>, the lone victim in this group of the 1 PR curse, lost a place as a result, but he still didn't pick up as much AF as he could have. <font color=yellow>#66 Thomas Ullrich</font> updated his timesheet with 38 new PR's and made a huge cut of exactly 33 AF and 28 places, knocking off nearly a quarter of his old AF. His move outpaced new up-and-comer <font color=yellow>#75 Martin Blue's,</font> but Martin was undeterred, his 18 PR's and 26 AF cut shooting him up 16 places. <font color=yellow>#91 Viktor Silivanov</font> got pushed back by the two leapfroggers, but his 5 PR's and 2 AF cut held his position loss to 1 instead of 2, at least. Finally, <font color=yellow>#99 Frederick Hutchington</font> gave a vivid demonstration of why it's a bad idea for partiers to stand too close to the 100 door, as he charged in with 9 PR's and an 11 place cut. He mauled Carlos Eduardo in the process and left him out on the porch as a warning to other would-be party crashers, leaving Thibaud Bordeau to guard the doorway.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Meanwhile, out in the front yard, <font color=yellow>#104 Noah Gordon</font> stared longingly at the door and started moving toward it, but fell victim to the 1 PR curse and was quickly passed by Frederick. <font color=yellow>#108 Martin Prigent</font> almost managed to get closer with his 1 PR and small AF cut but ended up in the exact same position as before, again due to Nosey's move. <font color=yellow>#128 Dexter Howe</font> was yet another victim of the 1 PR curse, as he fell back in AF and stayed in place. <font color=yellow>#141 Blake Germany</font> had better luck, as he moved at double speed with 3 PR's and a 6 position improvement. <font color=yellow>#149 Tonny Su</font> and <font color=yellow>#151 Will Eudy</font> made solid cuts in AF with 3 and 2 PR's respectively, but didn't actually move up in places. It's a good thing for Will that he played, though, because <font color=yellow>#152 Fabio Sacco</font> would have passed him if he hadn't. As it is, Fabio still got himself a nice 15.25 AF cut with 10 PR's and subbed 200 in AF, passing 6 guys in the process. Appearing to fill the vacancy left by Fabio is <font color=green>#158 Michael Miller</font>, a newcomer to the full AF chart. He makes a solid debut, and his recent activity promises further improvements. Next up is <font color=yellow>#169 Pierre-Emmanuel Medus</font>, who made the biggest raw AF cut of the update. With 24 PR's, he jumped 21 places and knocked off more than 42 points from his AF. <font color=yellow>#178 Murray Wright</font> felt the effects of those last two players' activity, as he found himself 1 rank lower than before. He still cut almost 3 AF with 11 PR's, though.<br>Farther afield, newcomer <font color=lime>#213 Rob Jon</font> joined the site at a respectable rank; with more work, he could make the Top 200 very soon. <font color=yellow>#214 Dave Johnston</font> worked hard, earning 7 PR's, but he didn't move in the rankings. <font color=yellow>#232 Julian Stephens</font> did, though, his 5 PR's bumping him up one spot. And rounding out the Top 300, <font color=yellow>#274 Andrea Gardina</font> found the time to play Mario Kart Wii as well, it seems, sending in 12 PR's to gain 2 places.<br>Way out in the graveyard where no one plays, <font color=yellow>#369 David Berger</font> showed that he's still alive and kicking. He churned out 13 PR's, making his way past the resting places of 3 departed karters. And finally, down very close to the end of the line is <font color=yellow>#404 Kristopher Lamp</font>. I think this may actually be the first time I've seen someone in the 400's pick up a controller and play. Kristopher hasn't let his position get him down, as he's turned up from time to time to send in new times. This week, he submitted 16, but alas for him, he ended up 1 rank lower due to new arrivals above. I think we could all learn a lesson from him about perseverance, though--you're never too low to improve.<br><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>There were 3 new Site Records this week. As far as Site Record possession goes, no one was knocked off the table this week. Blake Germany was the only new record holder who didn't have any others before.<br><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>beat Ethan McCormac's old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross crs</font> time of 1'49\"502 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"366</font><br><font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney </font>beat Marc Bas's old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape lap</font> time of 0'44\"404 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'44\"367</font><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Ullrich </font>beat his own old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 0'19\"581 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'19\"578</font><br><br><br>Well, that's it for this update. I hope you'll excuse any incoherencies that may have accumulated as a result of being distracted by trick-or-treaters... :P Anyway, I'll see you next week. Happy karting and Happy Halloween everyone!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hello again, MrL1193 here to bring you another boring update on this damp November night. I hope the weather is better wherever you are than it is here in California; I'm posting this update after 1 AM because this is the first chance I'm getting after the thunder and lightning. This update will cover activity from <font color=red>October 31st - November 6th</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>1 new player this week. Welcome <font color=lime>Carter Clem</font>, who joined with the usual 32 courses. His half timesheet puts him at a theoretical rank of 230, which is pretty good for a start. Hopefully he'll look up his lap times soon.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>26 players were active these last 6 days, which seems to be about the typical number nowadays. We'll have to wait and see if it holds up once Mario Kart 7 is released.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>We start things off as usual with the Top 10--which, this week, is not actually the Top 10 but rather the Top 11. 11 was also the number of PR's <font color=yellow>#4 Jay Batten</font> submitted; with them, he cut more than a full point of AF and nabbed a SR. The only other player active here was <font color=yellow>#10 Tony Ruiz</font>, who sent in 6 PR's to cut ~1.2 AF and move into an exact tie with ex-champ Bubbles for the end spot in the group--hence why there are 11 players covered in only 10 ranks. No doubt this situation will change by next week, but for now you can just enjoy watching my paragraphs get messed up.<br><br><font color=red>~~12-25~~</font><br>Meanwhile, in the newly shortened group just below, <font color=yellow>#14 Thomas van Deerse</font> decided that he was tired of PR'ing without making any headway and sent in 6 PR's this time, enough to cut 1.75 AF and pass 1 player. The only other activity came from <font color=yellow>#19 John Brunn</font>, whose 1 PR wasn't enough to make either of those kinds of progress.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Activity picks up a bit in the next paragraph as we find more karters active here. The first of them is <font color=yellow>#32 James Richards</font>. With his lone PR, he exactly halved his AF losses, which still marks some progress relative to the other players. <font color=yellow>#35 Marvin Donjes</font>, however, wasn't willing to settle for such a small victory and instead made a very efficient cut of 2.5 AF and 4 places with only 3 PR's. <font color=yellow>#38 Matthias Sempels</font> made a similarly efficient cut with 2 PR's, moving 3 places and cutting ~1.8 AF. And <font color=yellow>#44 Martin Blue</font> decided on a plan of full-blown massacre, jumping 31 places with 20 PR's. Martin's been moving up the charts in leaps and bounds lately; I wouldn't be surprised if he finds his way into the Top 25 by next week. Finishing this section, <font color=yellow>#49 Zack McNell</font> cut a bit of AF with 2 PR's but still lost a spot to Martin.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>With the exit of Martin, the lower half of the Top 100 wasn't left with much activity. There were still a few guys who made some progress, though, such as <font color=yellow>#56 Danny Gallenberger</font>. With 4 PR's, he made a nice 2.2 AF cut and gained 2 places even as Martin shot past him. Following this, we have a long empty space of Inactivity...and after it,<font color=yellow>#83 Andre Hoelscher</font>. Andre sent in 7 PR's, enough for a nice 4.4 AF cut and 1 position gained. And closing out the Top 100, we have <font color=yellow>#91 Viktor Silivanov</font>. His 1 PR wasn't enough to cut AF, but he didn't fall down as much as the guys around him, at least.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Activity outside the Top 100, like the activity within it, was rather spread out. <font color=yellow>#104 Noah Gordon</font> managed a PR, but it wasn't quite enough to nullify his AF losses. Almost 50 places lower, however, <font color=yellow>#151 Will Eudy</font> did manage to cut a full point of AF with 1 PR. He didn't pass anyone this week, but he's in good shape to do so next week. <font color=yellow>#158 Michael Miller's</font> 2 PR's, on the other hand, were strikingly unhelpful in terms of AF; surprisingly, it seems that he only made a cut of 1 position on the individual times charts between his 2 PR's. Ah well, AF isn't all that matters, I suppose. <font color=yellow>#164 Jose Karica</font> made a PR this week and cut a bit of AF, but stayed in place as well. <font color=yellow>#171 Eric Shore</font> was the first to make a move here, with 10 PR's yielding a nice ~5.2 AF, 4 position cut. <font color=yellow>#193 Munim Peerally</font> made one as well, with 8 PR's earning him a big 17 place move and an almost 17 point AF cut. And the last big mover of this update was <font color=yellow>#202 Dave Johnston</font>, who skimmed over 13 karters with his 10 PR's and ~11.1 AF cut. We're not done with the small moves yet, though. Recent newcomer <font color=yellow>#211 Rob Jon</font> cut 2 places with 4 PR's--a good sign, as it shows that he actually has intentions of playing now that he's got a timesheet up. <font color=yellow>#232 Julian Stephens</font> PR'ed 3 times, but the resultant ~1.2 AF cut wasn't enough for him to pass anyone. <font color=yellow>#273 Andrea Gardina</font> continued his Mario Kart Wii activity this week with 9 PR's, enough to cut ~5.6 AF and 1 position. And finally, <font color=green>#275 Samuel Laryea</font> completed his timesheet this week and joined the AF chart at the tail end of the Top 300 and this update.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>There were 4 new Site Records to report this week. Glitch tracks were the most prominently featured, including the newly popularized GCN DK Mountain glitch. On the Site Records rankings, Jay Batten managed to get onto the table by taking one of Paul-Phillip Baehr's 4 SR's, knocking Paul down to T5th with 3, and Tony Ruiz doubled his count to 2 for T8th and knocked Dave Tandy off the table. Danny Gallenberger almost made an appearance, but Jay Batten beat him out before I could acknowledge his SR.<br><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'05\"218 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'04\"984</font><br><font color=yellow>Marvin Donjes </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'39\"903 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'39\"770</font><br><font color=yellow>Ethan McCormac </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font> time of 0'35\"358 and achieved the first DKSC God Flap with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"298</font><br><font color=yellow>Jay Batten </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain lap</font> time of 0'39\"902 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'39\"716</font><br><br><br>And with that, my job here is done. I bid you all good night--or good morning, or whatever it is for you... :doze:<br><br>Zzzzzz...<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, MrL1193 here again. It's time for the weekly news update, and once again, I've put it off until nighttime. Ah well, better late than never, eh? Fortunately for me, the activity level dropped with the temperature this week, so it didn't take as long as usual. This update covers <font color=red>November 6 - November 13</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>2 new players this week: <font color=lime>Josh Miller</font> and <font color=lime>Christian Sari</font>. Each of them joined with the usual 32 times, Josh theoretically slotting in somewhere around 334 and Christian at about 253.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Only 15 players showed up as active this week, though about half of all the players showed up as earning an AF cut due to a player being deleted. I suspect that there should be more karters to mention, but because of the way the timing of the updates worked out, a good chunk of activity will have to wait until next week. Oh well, that just leaves more space in this update for everything, I guess.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>We start off in the Top 10 with one of the usual suspects, <font color=yellow>#4 Jay Batten</font>. With 5 PR's, he made a sizable move toward #3 Nick Meade. <font color=yellow>#8 Aziz Abdullah</font> was active as well with 4 PR's, though his rank didn't change either. And down at the lower border, <font color=yellow>#10 Tony Ruiz</font> broke his previous week's tie with David McPartland by sending in 4 PR's, 3 of which were SR's--quite the enviable feat. Also, this is the first time in more than two and a half years that Bubbles hasn't been in the Top 10; it's a testament to the strength of his times that it took this long to finally happen, and would have taken even longer without new glitches.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>In the \"Almost Famous\" group, we find exactly as many active karters as in the Top 10. They were all quite close together, as it happens. <font color=yellow>#18 Artur Bauer</font> started off as the lowest-ranked of the three, but he submitted 12 PR's to jump 6 places, finishing above the other two. <font color=yellow>#20 John Brunn</font> and <font color=yellow>#21 Salvatore Bellusci</font> were each knocked back a place, but they still played to cut their losses. John made a minor cut with 2 PR's, while Salvatore made a bigger one with 5 and almost overtook John.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>The lower half of the Top 50 proves to be the third group in a row to contain exactly 3 active karters. <font color=yellow>#30 Liam Ashcroft</font> cut some AF with 2 PR's, but didn't move. <font color=yellow>#34 Marvin Donjes</font> did, however, passing one karter with 6 PR's and a pretty big AF cut. And down at the bottom of the group, <font color=yellow>#50 Franco Gubser</font> managed a PR but couldn't quite push himself any further from the brink. He's been hovering around here for a while now; time will tell whether he'll be able to hang on.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>The area below the Top 50 marks a sharp dropoff in activity, as the often inactive half of the Top 100 didn't fail to disappoint. Out of 50 karters, only one had anything to report: <font color=yellow>#92 Sam Smith</font>. He only showed 1 PR, but it was worth a decent cut in AF by itself. There was no movement by anyone here.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-410~~</font><br>Not to be outdone, the last group of the update contained 310 players total but only 2 active players. Those two happened to be neighbors, both to start and to finish. <font color=yellow>#150 Fabio Sacco</font> started the week just below <font color=yellow>#151 Will Eudy</font>, but proceeded to pass both Will and one other karter with just 2 PR's, cutting several points of AF in the process. Will managed to hold his ground with a lone PR, though, and thus stayed close to Fabio. And with that, we're already done with the movement!<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>The Site Records scene was all Jarv this week, as Tony Ruiz stole 3 SR's to move up to 3rd place with 5 total. Marvin Donjes dropped to tied 11th with just 1 left and Jay Batten and Rhys Ogle were knocked out completely.<br>On an interesting side note, Aziz Abdullah briefly took the DK Mountain course record with a time of 2'06\"265 before Jarv claimed it with the glitch. Doom's time remains the Non-SC World Record, though, and is still a new Non-SC SR. I don't have the means to track all the Non-SC SR's at the moment, but for now, you can enjoy the inclusion of just this one.<br><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat Marvin Donjes's old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'39\"770 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'39\"645</font><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat Rhys Ogles's old <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain crs</font> time of 2'06\"858 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'05\"748</font><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat Jay Batten's old <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain lap</font> time of 0'39\"716 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'39\"385</font><br><br>That concludes my part of the update. Web has been working on awards lately, however, so keep an eye out for a possible update on those. And, regardless of how that goes, I should be seeing you next week. Until then, take care, and happy karting!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, it's been another week. Time for another news update--and also, an announcement. For some time now, the awards section of the site has been rather neglected, but that ends now. All awards up through the second week of November have now been updated, and you can thank your former news writer Zack Weber a.k.a. The Webinator for most of them. Be sure to check them out; you may have won some of your own!<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>There were 2 new players this week: <font color=lime>Anthony Caiulo</font> and <font color=lime>Anton Tamminen</font>, who could well be Mario Kart twins. They each joined with the typical 32 course times and rather similar theoretical AF as well. Anthony currently slots in at 318, while the similarly-named Anton appears at around 322.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>29 players sent in PR's this week--or last week, in some cases. If you thought you made an improvement last week but weren't mentioned, you'll probably find your overdue credit in this update.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>In the Top 10, only the usual two British players were active: <font color=yellow>#2 Shaun Tanney</font> and <font color=yellow>#4 Jay Batten</font>. Shaun only PR'ed once for a slight reduction in AF losses, while Jay PR'ed 4 times to actually make a slight cut. They've both managed to climb up a bit in the ranks recently, and with current and former champions Jorge and Nick inactive, there's plenty of opportunity for each of them, if they can cross the AF gaps ahead of them.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>As is often the case, the next group down from the Top 10 is the most proportionally active one this week. <font color=yellow>#13 Tyler McNell</font> sent in 6 PR's for a nice AF cut, though he fell just short of passing Jimmy Benson. <font color=yellow>#14 Thomas van Deerse</font> managed an AF cut as well with 2 PR's, but even as he moved forward, Tyler was pulling further away from him. <font color=yellow>#17 Fabien Jacques</font>, however, easily overtook 2 karters with 5 PR's and a big ~3.2 AF cut. His AF improvement was proportionally the largest of the update, at roughly 7%. And closing in on the spot Fabien left is <font color=yellow>#20 Salvatore Bellusci</font>. With his 5 PR's, he cut just over half a point of AF and passed <font color=yellow>#21 John Brunn</font>, whose 1 PR couldn't quite neutralize his AF loss.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Just outside the Top 25, <font color=yellow>#26 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> moved closer to the next group with 7 PR's, knocking more than a whole point of AF off his score to end the week at exactly 52 AF. His rank didn't change this week, but with another nice improvement like that one, he should be able to earn his promotion. Fellow German <font color=yellow>#33 Marvin Donjes</font> was also active with 6 PR's, managing to beat Paul's cut by exactly a quarter of a point and 1 rank improvement. And down below, <font color=yellow>#49 Zack McNell</font> beats the AF treadmill for the week with 1 PR. Both he and #50 Franco Gubser have been hanging on by a thread lately; with some new faces knocking on the door of the Top 50, they'll need to step up their pace if they want to stay in it.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Right below the slow-moving guys, we have a veritable three-ring circus, as several karters simultaneously make large strides forward and play musical chairs in their bid for the Top 50. <font color=yellow>#52 Sebastian Kovats</font> decided to submit 10 PR's this week to cut around 2 and a half points of AF and pass three karters. <font color=yellow>#55 Danny Gallenberger</font> filled the vacancy he left behind, cutting ~2.2 AF with 3 PR's and passing one karter. And <font color=yellow>#56 Dave Tandy</font> filled the vacancy <i>he</i> left behind by passing 2 karters with 6 PR's, cutting over 3 points of AF. The only other activity here was down at the lower end of the group, coming from <font color=yellow>#93 Frederick</font> <font color=orange>\"5\"</font> <font color=yellow>Hutchington</font>. Frederick sent in 5 PR's, cut ~5.5 AF, and passed 5 karters. Somebody give that guy a high five, 'cause he deserves it.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>As we exit the Top 100, it becomes more difficult to see who really made progress in AF, as there was a player deletion that affected a lot of players. <font color=yellow>#103 Noah Gordon</font> definitely made progress, though, as he made another attempt to reenter the Top 100. His 3 PR's yielded a 1 place move and ~1.4 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#126 Dexter Howe</font> made a nice, neat move as well, climbing 2 ranks with 2 PR's. <font color=yellow>#139 Tonny Su</font> made a big jump, with 11 PR's pushing him forward 10 places. <font color=yellow>#150 Will Eudy</font> managed to gain a spot with 3 PR's. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#191 Munim Peerally</font> and <font color=yellow>#198 Dave Johnston</font> jumped on the \"pass 1 player per PR\" train as well, choosing 2 and 4 respectively as their lucky numbers. <font color=yellow>#205 Daniel Crutcher</font> and <font color=yellow>#232 Julian Stephens</font>, on the other hand, missed the train and didn't go anywhere with their 3 and 1 PR's respectively. And finally, we come to <font color=yellow>#269 Andrea Gardina</font> and <font color=yellow>#354 Christophe Charignon</font>, who are widely separated in rank, but were seemingly united in their motivation to play--Combined Rankings points. Each of them passed 4 players, Andrea with 7 PR's and Christophe with 15. And that finishes the movement section!<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>There was just 1 new SR this week. The result of it was that Paul-Philipp Baehr and Tony Ruiz have both ended up in a 4-way tie for 3rd place, with 4 SR's each.<br><br><font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr </font>beat Tony Ruiz's old <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain lap</font> time of 0'39\"385 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'39\"037</font><br><br><br>I'll try to keep the awards updated from now on, and starting next week, I plan to add them to each update. In the meantime, enjoy your Thanksgiving guys! (And if you're not American, I guess you can just take advantage of this week to pass some distracted karters, hehe.) :hehe: See you next update!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hello, MrL1193 here to bring you the weekly news. I hope you guys had a happy Thanksgiving (assuming you're American, that is).<br><br><br>Now, before I get to the actual update, I'd like to take a moment to draw attention to the process of times submissions. It seems that a number of you guys don't quite understand the proper procedure to ensure that times are updated quickly and accurately, so I think a brief review of certain points is in order. Here are some basic guidelines to follow:<br><br><font color=orange>Make sure you include your name in your messages.</font> You can put it in either the subject or the message body, but make sure it's there. Otherwise, your times <i>will not be updated</i>. Don't rely on us recognizing you by e-mail address either, as one person can be submitting times for multiple people in some cases. It's a simple policy, really--if we don't know for sure whose times they are, then we don't update them.<br><br><font color=orange>Use the official site abbreviations for the courses.</font> You can find the full list of these on the \"Joining Info\" page. You can also type the full name of the course, but you have to be careful not to make a typo in doing so. The reason this is important is that we updaters use a tool called a parser to extract information from messages, and the parser is not as adaptable as a human being. If a message is formatted incorrectly, it will either make an error or not recognize the score at all. For example, both \"Moonview Highway\" and \"MH\" would be acceptable, but \"MVH\" would not. Similarly, \"N64 Bowser's Castle\" and \"RBC\" are fine, but \"R Bowser's Castle\" is not.<br>A related problem that occasionally crops up is getting the names and times of certain retro tracks inadvertently mixed together. This can happen quite easily; simply typing, \"SNES Mario Circuit 3: 24.500\" for your flap will result in the parser picking up the time \"3:24.500,\" which is not what you want. Use some other symbol, such as a dash, to separate them instead of a colon.<br><br><font color=orange>Don't put all your PR's on one line.</font> This is also for the sake of the parser; if you put all your PR's on one line, the parser reads them as all being for the same course. Use proper line breaks to make sure that doesn't happen.<br><br><font color=orange>Separate your SC and Non-SC times in your message.</font> This makes it much easier to sort and check them. And, of course, if your times are all of one type, don't forget to specify whether they are SC or Non-SC. It makes our job much easier if you eliminate the guesswork.<br><br>And finally, don't forget to double-check your submissions to make sure they're free of typos. We can sometimes catch typos for you, but there's no guarantee that we'll know what you intended to type. Save time and make sure you get it right the first time.<br><br>Now, let's get on with the news, shall we?<br><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Two players joined the site this week, the same number as last week. Welcome <font color=lime>Michael Rippstein</font> and <font color=lime>Kenneth Kang</font>. Michael's only starting time was a Yoshi Falls lap, which was impressively ranked at #3. Kenneth's 32 course times gave a better estimate of his overall ability, putting him at approximately 244th.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>An average 25 players reported new times, though I wouldn't have thought it to look at the full AF chart movement. I guess the guys with incomplete timesheets were busy as well this week, but that concerns us not.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>As usual, <font color=yellow>#2 Shaun Tanney</font> was active this week. With 4 PR's, he would have broken even in AF if not for the appearance of newbie Michael and his YF lap. Right behind him, <font color=yellow>#3 Jay Batten</font> didn't slow his pace for a moment, as he cut another .375 off his AF with 6 PR's--a huge move at such a high rank. He passed former champ Nick Meade and is now barely a tenth of a point away from taking Shaun's title of UK and European champion. Chronic hoarder <font color=yellow>#6 Dustin Enders</font> showed up this week as well, this time with 12 PR's bringing an enormous ~6.1 AF cut, more than a fifth of his total. Dustin passed three karters, though one, Aziz Abdullah, pulled a magic trick and somehow stayed at the same rank without doing a thing. And <font color=yellow>#10 Tony Ruiz</font> shows that he's here to stay, as 8 new PR's push him further into the Top 10.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>There wasn't a whole lot of activity to report outside the Top 10. Slow but steady, <font color=yellow>#14 Thomas van Deerse</font> sent in another PR this week, but still took a hit in AF. <font color=yellow>#21 John Brunn</font> fared a bit better, as his 1 PR yielded a slight cut, but he still didn't quite pass anyone.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>The second quarter of the Top 100 was quiet as well this week. Near the top, <font color=yellow>#27 Kevin Mason</font> sent in 3 PR's to gain 2 places, and down below, <font color=yellow>#49 Zack McNell</font> and <font color=yellow>#50 Franco Gubser</font> submitted 2 PR's each to distance themselves from the pack below. Zack still lost ground in AF, but Franco made good progress, and they're now almost even with each other.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Continuing on, we find none of the regulars of this group. Instead, <font color=yellow>#67 Andre Hoelscher</font> popped up this week with 17 new PR's, cutting almost that many points of AF and 16 places. The only other active karter here was <font color=yellow>#93 Jon Coppernoll</font>, who gained a spot with 4 PR's.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Just outside the Top 100, <font color=yellow>#101 Noah Gordon</font> reported 2 new PR's and passed two players. He's been working on reentering it for a while now, and looks set to do so very soon. <font color=yellow>#119 Joshua Leutz</font> PR'ed twice as well, but didn't move up or cut AF. A good bit lower, <font color=yellow>#191 Munim Peerally</font> made a strong cut of ~5.8 AF with only 2 PR's, but also failed to gain positions. <font color=yellow>#238 Florian Truetschel</font> did, however. 26 PR's catapulted him forward 14 places and took more than 20 points off his AF. <font color=yellow>#267 Andrea Gardina</font> continued his Mario Kart Wii activity this week with an efficient move of 2 places with 2 PR's. And finally, <font color=yellow>#348 Christophe Charignon</font> also stayed active, moving 6 places with 16 PR's.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>There were two more Site Records to report this week. Tony Ruiz broke the tie for third place to claim it for himself with 5 SR's, while Paul-Philipp Baehr lost a SR and dropped to tied 6th with 3.<br><br><font color=yellow>1'59\"945 </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Moonview Highway crs</font> time of 1'43\"687 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'43\"666</font><br><font color=yellow>Tony Ruiz </font>beat Paul-Philipp Baehr's old <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain lap</font> time of 0'39\"037 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"896</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>The 3rd POW of November goes to <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font>. While other karters update their times irregularly, Jay remains constant, climbing ever higher. This week, a solid 4 PR's knocked around 0.74% off his AF and put him within striking distance of third place.<br><br><br>That wraps it up for this update.

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, it's news time again. I know this update is a couple days late, but I didn't forget about you guys. A couple different problems transpired to cause delays. The first was a surprise windstorm that knocked out the power in my area for a couple days. (I thought we were supposed to have earthquakes in California, not hurricanes... :confused:</b><b>) Actually, though, that didn't affect the news, since it happened in the middle of the week. The other, more troublesome problem was with the site's updating pages, which kept me from updating times this weekend. I actually could have written up the news if I'd wanted, but since that would have meant an incomplete news update (which no one likes), I decided to wait for the problem to be fixed. So, to compensate, you get to read about the events of a little more than a week this time. This update covers <font color=red>November 27 - December 6</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>5 players joined the site in the time between updates, a bit more than usual. It's a good sign, as the site will want new players to make up for those distracted by the recently-released Mario Kart 7.<br><font color=lime>Qi Zhu</font> sent in 62 times for a start. His theoretical rank is #158 for the moment--quite solid--so hopefully he'll fill in those last two times soon to join the full ranks.<br><font color=lime>Kenesu Kuro</font> came up with 31 times in his debut, one less than the usual and exactly half as many as Qi Zhu. With several Top 10 times to his name, Kenesu's theoretical rank for the moment is #194--pretty impressive for having less than half a timesheet, though it still won't garner as much recognition as an actual rank.<br><font color=lime>Ryan Crawshaw</font> sent in 2 starter times, which doesn't say much about his potential. Theoretically, he would be 412th, but that's hardly an accurate estimate.<br>The other two newbies, <font color=lime>Claire March</font> and <font color=lime>Jordon Gabbard</font>, joined with full timesheets and will be mentioned later.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>A good 25 players were active these last 9 days, a nice change from recent weeks.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>As is often the case, the Top 10 was rather quiet. Only <font color=yellow>#2 Shaun Tanney</font> reported a new PR, and it wasn't enough to overcome the AF treadmill. He did pull away from Jay Batten a bit, however, slightly strengthening his position as European Champion.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>The Top 25 area didn't have much more to report on, with only two more players active. <font color=yellow>#14 Thomas van Deerse</font> played enough to earn 3 PR's, but as in past weeks, he failed to cut AF. <font color=yellow>#20 John Brunn</font> was a bit more successful, with 2 PR's allowing him to pass a karter to reenter the Top 20.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Activity picks up slowly but surely with the Top 50 group, which featured three other active karters. <font color=yellow>#32 Marvin Donjes</font> sent in 3 PR's and somehow managed to gain a place while moving backwards in AF. <font color=yellow>#35 Matthias Sempels</font> made a more straightforward move, cutting AF and passing 3 players with 2 PR's, one of which was <font color=yellow>#38 Zane Royal</font>. He submitted a PR but still lost a place because of Fisico, and he didn't cut AF, either.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Following a trend, the fourth group in the update happens to have 4 players active. DKJP master <font color=yellow>#57 Max Awesome</font> sent in 28 PR's after a long break and jumped 18 places. Just below him, <font color=green>#59 Dylan Imhoff</font> finally filled in his flaps and joined the rankings, demoting a whole bunch of karters below. At the moment, Chouy's flap times are still far weaker than his course times, so he still has plenty of potential for improvement if he feels like it. Lower down, another player returning from a break, <font color=yellow>#85 Alex Vandegrift</font>, submitted 24 PR's to gain 10 positions. And finally, <font color=yellow>#94 Frederick Hutchington</font> made a good cut of ~3.3 AF with 4 PR's, but his movement was canceled out by Dylan's and Alex's activity and left him right where he was before.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-415~~</font><br>It falls to the last and largest group to provide the bulk of the activity this update. <font color=yellow>#127 Dexter Howe</font> managed a PR, but lost a place because of Dylan's entry above. <font color=yellow>#145 Brett Edwards</font>, however, made good progress with 2 PR's. In lieu of a 945 to claim, \"Mr. <font color=yellow>1</font>'59\"9<font color=yellow>45</font>\" settled for passing 3 karters to take a numbered position that bears some slight resemblance to his favorite numerals. <font color=yellow>#151 Will Eudy</font> also made 2 PR's, but lost to the AF treadmill and got bumped down a position, again due to Chouy. <font color=yellow>#159 Zack Weber</font> slid back in AF as well, but at least his 1 PR anchored him in place on the rankings. A bit lower, <font color=green>#166 Christian Sari</font> made his debut, with the submission of his flap times earning him a respectable starting rank. Former karts-only player <font color=yellow>#195 Tony Fan</font> returned to submit a PR, but received a double demotion from the new entries above him. Outside the Top 200, <font color=green>#243 Anton Tamminen</font> filled out his timesheet for a decent starting position; he seems interested in the game so far, so hopefully we'll see some more progress from him soon.<br>To finish this section, we have to go far, far down, to a region that's mostly comprised of players who simply don't care any more. Web's brother <font color=yellow>#383 Quassim Weber</font> apparently isn't one of these dead players, though. He took a 2 place loss because of new AF entrants, but his 2 PR's were enough to keep it from becoming three. And finally, at the very end, we have our newbies of the update, <font color=lime>#407 Jordon Gabbard</font> and <font color=lime>#415 Claire March</font>. Jordon's times are of interest mainly because he claims that they were all set with the Shooting Star; it doesn't seem to have helped his ranking, but it's unique. Claire's entry is noteworthy for a different reason--namely, that she(?) has taken from Peter Ferguson the dubious honor of having the highest number next to her name on the full AF rankings. She seems ready to improve, though, so she may shed that distinction before long.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>None. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Zero. Yep, that's right, there were NO new Site Records this week. It's a pretty safe bet that Neos will have one for us next update, though, so you can look forward to that.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>November 4th POW: <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font> - In yet another impressive week, Jay finally overtook Nick for third place with 6 new PR's. He cut nearly .4 AF, more than 3% of his total.<br>November POM: <font color=yellow>Dustin Enders</font> - Although Jay reported more PR's, Dustin earned bigger cuts. Yet again reclaming his German crown from Mark Schmidt, Dustin cut ~5.7 AF, almost a fifth of his total, and moved from #9 to #6.<br><br><br>That'll do it for this update. No doubt you guys will be too busy with Mario Kart 7 to play much Mario Kart Wii in coming weeks, but remember: if you get tired of the game, Mario Kart Wii is still here for you! Have fun, and happy karting!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

But before I get to that, I'd just like to mention that the Mario Kart 7 site is up and running now, so be sure to check that out if you haven't already. You can give feedback in the Mario Kart 7 section of the message boards.<br>Now, as for Mario Kart Wii, since last week's update was delayed and lengthened, this one ended up being shorter than usual to compensate.

That's my job, not yours.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Only the usual suspect, <font color=yellow>#2 Jay Batten</font>, was active here. With 4 PR's, he passed Shaun Tanney to become European Champion on the site.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>The Top 25 as a whole didn't seem to be much affected by the shorter updating period, as approximately the usual number of players were active. <font color=yellow>#14 Thomas van Deerse</font>, one of the regulars of this section, PR'ed twice and drew a good bit closer to #13 Tyler McNell. <font color=yellow>#20 John Brunn</font> also PR'ed twice with a pair of Non-SC Ghost Valley 2 times, including a short-lived Flap WR. However, former GV2 king <font color=yellow>#22 Jamie Disley</font> had something to say about that, and returned to reclaim his Flap WR from John in less than a day. His lone PR hardly had any impact on his AF, but he still managed to pass a player with some help from the usual vicissitudes of the AF chart.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Though not many got a chance to play this update, <font color=yellow>#32 Marvin Donjes</font> was active as usual. His lone PR was only a small improvement, but every little bit counts, especially in the higher ranks. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#47 Dave Tandy</font> released a massive 26 PR hoarded submission and jumped 9 places, straight into the Top 50.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#55 Danny Gallenberger</font> gets this section all to himself, as the other 49 karters were inactive. Although he was passed by Dave, Danny's 2 PR's kept him from dropping a position and got him another step closer to the Top 50.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Outside the Top 100, <font color=yellow>#126 Dexter Howe</font> gained 1 spot with 1 big PR on Shy Guy Beach. <font color=yellow>#159 Zack Weber</font> was also busy on that track and got a sizeable PR of his own, though his ranking didn't improve. And farther back, <font color=yellow>#229 Anton Tamminen</font> submitted 9 PR's for a major cut of 14 places.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>None, unless you count the activity on GV2 Non-SC Flap that I already mentioned. Alas, the Non-SC part of the site still is not tracked by the stats program. Hopefully that will be remedied eventually.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Hey guys, Web here. John asked me to cover for him on the award since he was one of the top candidates for it, and he turned out to be the winner!<br><br>December 1st POW: <font color=yellow>John Brunn</font> - for non-hoarded players, Brunn stood above the rest. His two PRs netted him a 1.34% AF cut, which was better than the other regularly-active players could do.<br><br>I'll go back into my inactivity cave now. ~Web<br><br>That's all for now.

        "content": "<p><b>Hello everyone. MrL1193 here again, with your usual news update and an announcement. Recently, it's seemed as if we've had to delete or freeze suspected or proven cheaters on a nearly weekly basis. Well, just recently, suspicion fell upon our #2, Jay Batten. After some commotion, Jay provided all the necessary proof and was cleared of all charges. The result of this was that he was given the first green proof check of the Mario Kart Wii rankings and the community started going through the list of players to see who else has been naughty or nice. If you think you deserve to have a proof check, feel free to apply for one, providing any evidence necessary. For the moment, the qualifications for each check are roughly as follows:<br><br><font color=yellow>Yellow</font>: This mark simply shows that you're a trustworthy player. If you have a long history of honesty in Mario Kart or you've provided sufficient pictorial and video evidence of your times, you can receive this mark. We'll also likely give you one of these without any application if someone reliable vouches for you.<br><font color=lime>Green</font>: This mark indicates hard evidence that you're the real deal. Videos and pictures aren't enough for this; you need to actually play while reliable players watch you live to see if your skill matches your times. You don't necessarily have to set up a real-life meeting with someone; streaming over the internet works as well, as long as you let us know about your play session beforehand so we can watch. Just make sure to follow all the proper guidelines while streaming (ask our judges for more info on what these are, either before or during the stream).<br><br>And now, let's get on with the news.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>There were 3 newcomers this week.<br><br><font color=lime>Leo Petiard</font>, unlike most fresh players, actually completed a timesheet. We'll see how he fared later in the update.<br><font color=lime>Oliver Luyckx</font> scraped up the usual 32 course times--good enough for approximately 236th but no official rank.<br><font color=lime>Leon Williams</font> joined with an odd 13 times, hovering around 368th.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>25 karters found time in the midst of Christmas shopping to play--or perhaps just submit their times.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Only one karter at the top had anything to report this week. <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font> submitted 1 PR this week, a Coconut Mall glitch flap, which took almost a full point off his already-single-digit AF. #2 Jay Batten, who was silent this week, had been creeping up on him, but it now seems unlikely that the crown will be changing hands any time soon.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Just outside the Top 10, <font color=yellow>#12 Ruby Aruba</font> sent in 7 PR's for a nice cut in AF, enough to pass Jimmy Benson. It's a good thing he did, too, because <font color=yellow>#13 Thomas van Deerse</font> had a strong week as well. He cut about as much AF with only 3 PR's, also passed Jimmy, and would have overtaken Aruba as well if Aruba had stayed inactive. <font color=yellow>#22 Jamie Disley</font>, recently made a return to Mario Kart Wii, and this week, he made 2 more PR's for a slight cut of AF.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#30 Liam Ashcroft</font> was active as well this week. He turned out 2 PR's to cut some AF. And down at the border, <font color=yellow>#49 Franco Gubser</font> fought his way back into the Top 50 with 3 PR's. He only passed one player, but thanks to a player deletion above him, he gained two spots.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#55 Danny Gallenberger</font> managed a PR this week. He didn't quite cut AF, but, like Franco, he gained a free spot on the rankings. Other karters behind new AF entrant <font color=green>#69 Leo Petiard</font> stayed put, though, as Leo's appearance bumped them right back down. Undeterred, <font color=yellow>#92 Frederick Hutchington</font> decided to pass 2 player with 2 PR's anyway. <font color=yellow>#95 Loris Bagnasco</font> updated 26 of his times all at once for a 16 place move, jumping straight into the Top 100. And rounding out the group, <font color=yellow>#100 Noah Gordon</font> also makes it back in after a long struggle just outside it. He followed Frederick's example and also cut 2 places with 2 PR's.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Meanwhile, out in the less glamorous ranks, <font color=yellow>#104 Carlos Eduardo</font> had a new time to report. He still fell back a place because of Loris's move, though. <font color=yellow>#135 Brett Edwards</font> updated 7 of his times, skipping past 10 karters. <font color=yellow>#150 Will Eudy</font> moved up 1 position, PR'ing 3 times and ending the week with precisely half a point less in AF. <font color=yellow>#152 Fabio Sacco</font>'s lone PR, however, didn't gain him any places, though he cut AF. <font color=yellow>#158 Zack Weber</font> was quite busy this week, climbing up 1 place with 4 PR's. <font color=yellow>#166 Eric Shore</font> sent in some PR's as well, earning a nice 7 place cut with 8 PR's.<br>Beyond this week's subgroup in the Top 200, we find <font color=yellow>#225 Anton Tamminen</font>. He kept up activity in the game with 11 PR's and rose 4 positions. A little lower, <font color=yellow>#234 Julian Stephens</font> passed 1 player with 1 PR and stayed dead even in AF. And finally, much farther down, <font color=yellow>#415 Claire March</font> made an impressive effort of 21 PR's, but still has yet to make any headway in the rankings yet. Don't worry, with persistent effort, you'll improve soon!<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>For the third week in a row, there were none. Hopefully this isn't becoming a habit. Maybe we'll see more once the Non-SC section of the site is finished.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>December 2nd POW: <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font> - Another week, another award for Jay. Having dispelled any doubts about his legitimacy, Jay cut more than 2% off his AF total with 4 PR's.<br><br>That's all for now. The next news update probably won't be until after Christmas, as I'm not likely to get to write one on the actual day. Merry Christmas, and see you next update!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

The community got several nice Christmas presents in the form of new WR's; rather than deterring karters, the holidays seem to have spurred them on to greater feats, and there's quite a bit to write about. This update covers <font color=red>December 18 - December 26</font>.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Just one this Christmas: <font color=lime>Steve Bernelli</font>. He joined with only 4 times, but one of them was a Site Record. His theoretical rank is #404 for the moment.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Christmas break brought in a good deal of activity, with 35 players either playing or finally getting their times updated.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>The chase for the crown continues through Christmas as <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font> tries to pull further away from <font color=yellow>#2 Jay Batten</font>. With 3 PR's to report, Jorge made a pretty big cut for his level, but Jay still managed to close in a bit with his 8 PR's. Interestingly, Jay is one of only 3 players in the Top 10 to have no Site Records, despite being so close to the top; he'll have his work cut out for him if he wants to beat Jorge's impressive total of 8 SR's. And speaking of SR's, <font color=yellow>#7 Jak Russo</font> and <font color=yellow>#8 Aziz Abdullah</font> each had one to report. With 10 total PR's, Jak cut almost twice as much AF as Doom, but Doom was the one who moved up a spot, despite having only 2 new times.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>The 5 different players active in this group all had something in common: Their ranks stayed exactly the same. <font color=yellow>#12 Ruby Aruba</font> was the only one to cut AF, with his 6 PR's knocking off around 1.5 points. <font color=yellow>#13 Thomas van Deerse</font> played too, but with only 2 PR's, he couldn't catch up. The other players, <font color=yellow>#15 Alex Shoal</font>, <font color=yellow>#20 John Brunn</font>, and <font color=yellow>#22 Jamie Disley</font>, PR'ed once each but took a net loss in AF.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#30 Liam Ashcroft</font> kept busy in the week leading up to Christmas, earning 2 PR's to make a little progress. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#36 Clement Rouchon</font> submitted 12 PR's to cut exactly 12 places. <font color=yellow>#44 Dave Tandy</font> submitted another batch of times as well--10, to be exact--but only gained 2 places this time, as Clement shot past him. And rounding out the group, <font color=yellow>#49 Franco Gubser</font> and <font color=yellow>#50 Zack McNell</font> continued their usual policy of doing the bare minimum necessary to stay in the Top 50, with 2 and 1 PR's respectively.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>One karter who has an eye on the two easy marks just above is <font color=yellow>#51 Sebastian Kovats</font>, whose 7 PR's brought him up 1 position to the doorstep of the Top 50. <font color=yellow>#52 Max Awesome</font> came close as well, with 10 newly submitted times bumping him up 4 spots. <font color=yellow>#64 Leo Petiard</font> seems to be of the \"Minimum Effort, Maximum Gain\" school of thought, as he jumped 5 places and cut almost exactly that many points of AF with only 2 PR's. <font color=yellow>#88 Jon Coppernoll</font> didn't do too badly himself, though, cutting 9 places and ~9.7 AF with 10 PR's. And finishing this group, <font color=yellow>#98 Noah Gordon</font> set about solidifying his Top 100 status, with 3 PR's bringing him up from #100 to give him a bit of breathing room.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#117 Joshua Leutz</font> showed himself a candidate for the Mr. Efficiency title as well; with just 1 PR, he gained 3 places, though with a less impressive AF cut than the guys in the last paragraph. <font color=yellow>#126 Dexter Howe</font> made a decent AF cut as well with 2 PR's, but stayed in place. <font color=yellow>#134 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> had a solid week as well, with 3 PR's moving him up 4 places. <font color=yellow>#158 Zack Weber</font> took a net loss despite his 2 PR's, though, but <font color=yellow>#179 Murray Wright</font> drove one PR more to climb up a spot. <font color=yellow>#230 Julian Stephens</font> decided that he likes orderly progress, and, in 1 week, cut exactly 2 points of AF with 3 PR's and moved up 4 places.<br>Meanwhile, down in the quicksand of the lower ranks, <font color=yellow>#393 Jordon Gabbard</font> improved 59 PR's, almost his whole timesheet, and moved up 14 places into the Top 400. The new <font color=yellow>#407, Kristopher Lamp</font>, wasn't as lucky, as all the effort he put into earning 40 new PR's only moved him up 2 places. He still fared better than <font color=yellow>#415 Claire March</font>, though, who PR'ed 15 times but still hasn't been able to move up at all since joining the site. Hopefully they'll all keep trying until they can escape up to less hostile regions.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Christmastime brought a mass update of top times, including 8 new Site Records, causing quite a shakeup in SR totals. Aziz Abdullah, Lee Robbins, Sergio Mera Gallardo, Jak Russo, and Steve Bernelli all went from 0 to 1, while Jamie Disley, Max Awesome, and Andrew Grieve each doubled their count to 2. Romain Smadja dropped from 6 to 5 but is still 2nd only to Jorge Hernandez. Tony Ruiz's total fell from 5 to 3 and knocked him down to tied 4th, the same as Nick Meade, who also lost 1 SR. Paul-PhilippBaehr's 1 lost SR dropped him to tied 8th with 2 left, and Alex Shoal, Yu Nakano, and Blake Germany all lost their only SR's and dropped off the table entirely.<br><br><font color=yellow>Matthieu Mayer </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows crs</font> time of 1'15\"863 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'15\"859</font><br><font color=yellow>Andrew Grieve </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'51\"070 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'50\"897</font><br><font color=yellow>Lee Robbins </font>beat Tony Ruiz's old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'39\"645 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'39\"599</font><br><font color=yellow>Andrew Grieve </font>beat Blake Germany's old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross crs</font> time of 1'49\"366 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"100</font><br><font color=yellow>Steve Bernelli </font>beat Paul-Philipp Baehr's old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 0'33\"801 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"724</font><br><font color=yellow>Jak Russo </font>beat Nick Meade's old <font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time of 2'17\"683 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'17\"532</font><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> time of 1'48\"359 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'48\"275</font><br><font color=yellow>Jamie Disley </font>beat Romain Smadja's old <font color=orange>Moonview Highway lap</font> time of 0'33\"323 by 1 millisecond with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"322</font><br><font color=yellow>Aziz Abdullah </font>beat Yu Nakano's old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills crs</font> time of 1'35\"269 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'35\"114</font><br><font color=yellow>Max Awesome </font>beat Alex Shoal's old <font color=orange>N64 DK's Jungle Parkway crs</font> time of 2'12\"318 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'12\"175</font><br>Andrew Grieve beat Tony Ruiz's old <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain crs</font> time of 2'05\"748, but <font color=yellow>Sergio Mera Gallardo</font> surpassed them both with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'02\"241</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>3rd POW of December: <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font> - With a solid 5 PR's, Thomas finally made it past an AF gap and gained another place.

Former champ <font color=yellow>#4 Nick Meade</font> reported a PR as well and broke even in AF. And rounding out the Top 10, <font color=yellow>#9 Tony Ros</font> also PR'ed once and passed Mark Schmidt to get off the bubble position.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#12 Ruby Aruba</font> has been making a return to MKWii lately. His latest progress included 5 PR's, which brought him very close to former champ Bubbles at 11th. <font color=yellow>#13 Thomas van Deerse</font> clearly doesn't intend to let Aruba get away, though, as he was also active with 3 PR's and a bigger AF cut to catch up. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#20 Salvatore Bellusci</font> who had been silent for more than a month, came back with 14 PR's to barely edge out <font color=yellow>#21 John Brunn</font> for the last spot in the Top 20.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Like several players above, <font color=yellow>#28 Liam Ashcroft</font> reported 1 PR this week. He gained 2 places, though, so it must have been a pretty good improvement. Chronic hoarder/lazy updater <font color=yellow>#40 Dave Tandy</font> was also ready with 9 PR's this week, displacing 4 karters with his usual abruptness. <font color=yellow>#49 Sebastian Kovats</font> decided to make a jump of his own as well, and sent in 11 PR's to move up 2 places, straight into the Top 50. <font color=yellow>#50 Franco Gubser</font> was left on the edge as a result, but he was able to cut his losses with 4 PR's.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>All the players in this group made fairly large cuts to their AF this week, most of them with the help of some hoarding. <font color=yellow>#51 Max Awesome</font> made a run at the Top 50, but was rebuffed by Sebastian's move. He did, however, cut almost 3 points of AF and pass late #50 Zack McNell like Sebastian before him. <font color=yellow>#61 Leo Petiard</font> kept up his recent rapid progress with 16 PR's, gaining a quick 3 places with a ~6.78 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#86 Sean Owens</font> was up 6 places with 11 PR's, cutting just over 9 points. And rounding out the group, <font color=yellow>#93 Viktor Silivanov</font> cut 2 places and ~1.42 AF with 8 PR's.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>New Zealand's leading player, <font color=yellow>#125 Dexter Howe</font> opens the post-100 field with 2 PR's and a 1 place move. <font color=yellow>#150 Will Eudy's</font> progress matched his in those numbers, with a similar small AF cut. <font color=yellow>#156 Victor Pavao</font> submitted 5 PR's, but they weren't sufficient to keep him from falling back in AF and losing a place. <font color=yellow>#209 Rob Jon</font> made solid progress with 10 PR's and 4 places gained. <font color=yellow>#231 Julian Stephens</font> cut about 2.2 AF with 3 PR's, but he was pushed back 1 place. Meanwhile, <font color=green>#279 Josh Miller</font> finally completed his timesheet and joined in the middle ranks. His appearance didn't deter <font color=yellow>#286 Florian Chollet</font>, who moved up a spot with 2 PR's. <font color=yellow>#327 Jeff Hensel</font> worked hard to earn 21 PR's and cut ~11.69 AF, but he stayed right where he was in rank. And finally, <font color=yellow>#417 Claire March</font> kept up her activity with 10 PR's but still remains at the bottom of the ranks. Her persistence is admirable, however, and may yet bring results.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>None this week. Mario Kart Wii seems to be far from dead, however, so we can still hold out hope for more.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>4th POW of December: <font color=yellow>Ruby Aruba</font> - Aruba finished the year with a flurry of activity, squeezing in 10 PR's to cut ~5.86% off his AF--and still found time to make considerable contributions to the site.<br>December POM: <font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez</font> - With just 4 PR's, Jorge knocked a massive ~13.85% off his AF and reasserted his position as the reigning champ.<br>4th POQ, 2011: <font color=yellow>Dave Tandy</font> - Although hoarding often disqualified Dave for smaller awards, the sum of his efforts far exceeded everyone else's this quarter.

He had 1 new PR to show, which negated most but not all of the usual AF backsliding. <font color=yellow>#2 Jay Batten</font> still had Jorge's crown in his sights, and used his 3 PR's to close the gap by about 3 more tenths. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#4 Nick Meade</font> reported 2 new PR's, one of which was a reclaiming of the GCN Mario Circuit WR. <font color=yellow>#10 Mark Schmidt</font> was the last active player in the Top 10, with one small PR. He's fought with #6 Dustin Enders over the German crown in the past, but he has a long way to go if he wants to reclaim it this time.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Right behind Mark and looking to reenter the Top 10 is <font color=yellow>#11 Ruby Aruba</font>. With another strong week, he passed former champ David McPartland (who no longer holds the record for single longest reign) with 5 PR's and a ~1.28 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#13 Thomas van Deerse</font> had a strong week of his own, with 6 PR's and a ~1.47 AF cut, though he didn't quite manage to pass Bubbles to stick with Aruba in the rankings. Next up is <font color=green>#14 Lee Duggan</font>. Lee has been on the site for quite some time now but only just finished his timesheet with his last few flaps, to the annoyance of 415 karters below him who were demoted. <font color=yellow>#21 John Brunn</font> managed to avoid the demotion with a PR but still took a hit in AF. <font color=yellow>#22 Salvatore Bellusci</font> was the unlucky one of the group; he PR'ed 4 times but lost ground in AF and dropped 2 places to boot. That brings us to the biggest mover of the week, <font color=yellow>#25 Marvin Steven Eckhardt</font>. His big update of 33 PR's catapulted him forward 17 places, and probably further annoyed karters displaced by Lee's appearance with AF losses.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>The surge of activity slows as we exit the Top 25. <font color=yellow>#30 Liam Ashcroft</font> submitted 1 PR, but was pushed down 2 places by Lee and Marvin. <font color=yellow>#37 Dave Tandy</font> was unphased, however, continuing his climb to the top with 5 PR's and 3 places gained.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Former Top 50 member <font color=yellow>#51 Franco Gubser</font> got bumped out by Lee this week after hovering on the edge for some months. He did send in 2 PR's to offset his AF losses to keep within striking distance, though. <font color=yellow>#58 Joe Sebeny</font> and <font color=yellow>#62 Leo Petiard</font> also lost 1 place each and some AF, although they had 4 and 1 PR's respectively. <font color=yellow>#82 Sean Owens</font> made a neat cut of 6% of his AF with 6 PR's and gained 4 positions. <font color=yellow>#89 Jon Coppernoll</font> couldn't overcome AF losses this week, but he did hold his position with 2 PR's. And rounding out the Top 100, <font color=yellow>#92 Sebastian Wimmer</font> made a nice comeback to Mario Kart Wii with 8 PR's, moving up 3 places and cutting ~2.78 AF.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Once again, New Zealand champion <font color=yellow>#126 Dexter Howe</font> leads off the post-100. Unfortunately for him, his lone PR wasn't enough to keep him from losing a place and some AF. <font color=yellow>#136 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> couldn't quite keep ahead on the AF treadmill either, but he did at least keep his place in the rankings with 3 PR's. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#186 Munim Peerally</font> wins the Mr. Efficiency award this week by jumping up from #194 with 3 PR's. Taking into account the 1 place offset caused by Lee, that's an average of 3 players passed per PR, something I'm sure every other player wishes he could match. <font color=yellow>#201 Rob Jon</font> didn't do too badly himself, though, as he also passed 8 karters, though he had 6 PR's to report instead of 3. <font color=yellow>#279 Josh Miller</font> wasn't so lucky; he submitted a round dozen of PR's and cut ~3.47 AF but stayed right where he was in the rankings. Such is the lot of lower-ranked karters, unfortunately. And finally, newbie <font color=lime>#338 Timothee Le Borgne</font> joined at a modest rank in the 300's. Hopefully he'll surprise us with his progress soon.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>There were 3 new Site Records this week, but only 1 of them changed hands. Lee Duggan took one of Shaun Tanney's to get to tied 3rd with 4 SR's, dropping Shaun down to tied 13th with just 1.<br><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>beat Shaun Tanney's old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape lap</font> time of 0'44\"367 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'44\"304</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade </font>improved his own <font color=orange>GCN Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'31\"436 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'31\"421</font><br><font color=yellow>Tyler Reyes </font>improved his own <font color=orange>SNES Mario Circuit 3 crs</font> time of 1'18\"273 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'18\"261</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>The first POW of 2012 goes to <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font>.

There was a good bit to report on this week, including plenty of activity at the top ranks and the results of the poll to determine 2011's Player of the Year. This update covers <font color=red>January 9th - January 17th</font>.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Just one newbie this week: <font color=lime>Krystian Wieczorek</font>. He sent in 28 times to start, which puts him at approximately 416th for now.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>22 players were active this week, most of them in the higher ranks.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>3 players were active in the Top 10 this week--the past champion, the present champion, and the potential future champion of the site. <font color=yellow>#1 Jorge Hernandez</font> kept up his defense of his title with 5 PR's, dropping his AF under 7 again. However, <font color=yellow>#2 Jay Batten</font> relentlessly continued to close in on him. An incredible 11 PR streak narrowed the gap to just over 3 points and earned him admission to the exclusive Sub 10 AF Club, previously the sole territory of Jorge. Amazingly, Jay still doesn't have a single Site Record to his name (a situation which could change very quickly), which just goes to show you how important a balanced timesheet is to your AF. And coming now to the past champion of the trio, <font color=yellow>#4 Nick Meade</font> got a PR on Maple Treeway which almost regained him the World Record but didn't help his AF much.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>One player who has his sights set on joining the league of legends is Dutch Champion <font color=yellow>#11 Thomas van Deerse</font>. With an impressive 8 PR's, he passed 2 players and is now less than half an AF point away from #10 Mark Schmidt. <font color=yellow>#12 Ruby Aruba</font> made solid progress himself, with 5 PR's, but he still lost a place to Thomas. <font color=yellow>#16 Alex Shoal</font> didn't move anywhere, but he netted a big cut of ~1.20 AF with only 1 PR by getting himself a proper Coconut Mall glitch flap. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#19 John Brunn</font> PR'ed twice and moved up 2 places through a cluster of tightly-packed karters. It's a good thing that he did, because <font color=yellow>#22 Salvatore Bellusci</font> PR'ed thrice and almost jumped past John, but was left clutching at thin air instead. The three karters ahead of him are still very close together in AF, though, so he should have little difficulty moving up from here.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Just 2 karters were active here, one high and one low. <font color=yellow>#29 Liam Ashcroft</font> made a straightforward move of 1 place with 1 PR. And at the other end of the group, <font color=yellow>#47 Max Awesome</font> sent in a batch of 12 PR's, good enough to cut 5 places and gain admission into the Top 50.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>The heading \"51-100\" is a bit of a misnomer, because only a set of 3 consecutive karters near the top of the group were active. <font color=yellow>#52 Franco Gubser</font> came up with 1 PR, but was still pushed down a spot by Max. <font color=green>#53 Reinier de Jonge</font> sent in 4 new times and completed his timesheet, jumping into the middle spot. <font color=yellow>#54 Leo Petiard</font> completes the set, with a batch of 19 PR's propelling him forward 8 positions to latch onto the last spot.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>As usual, <font color=yellow>#126 Dexter Howe</font> is the first active player out in Triple Digit Land. He PR'ed twice and was rewarded with the right to remain stationary, though he did fall back slightly in AF. <font color=yellow>#181 Munim Peerally</font> sent in 7 PR's and jumped forward 5 places, cutting over 13 points of AF. <font color=yellow>#198 Rob Jon</font> made a large cut of his own of almost 7 points of AF, with 9 PR's. He moved forward 3 places, into the Top 200. <font color=yellow>#280 Josh Miller</font> submitted 3 PR's and cut just over a point of AF, but lost a place because of Reinier's entry far above him. And finally, everyone's favorite female karter <font color=yellow>#420 Claire March</font> made a bit more progress with 26 PR's. Slowly but surely, she continues to close the gap to #419 Peter Ferguson, so she may climb the ranks yet.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>There were 2 new Site Records this week. Thomas Petraud took Jak Russo's only SR to double his own SR count to 2, moving up to tied 8th in total SR's.<br><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud </font>beat Jak Russo's <font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time of 2'17\"532 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'17\"331</font><br><font color=yellow>Max Awesome </font>improved his own <font color=orange>N64 DK's Jungle Parkway crs</font> time of 2'12\"175 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'11\"440</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Congratulations to <font color=gold>Jay Batten</font>, 2011's Player of the Year! Jay won the poll by a landslide, becoming the first player to win a MKW POY award without ever having been Site Champion. Jay moved from #29 to #2 throughout 2011, cutting 44.25 AF points--a massive 79.6% of his starting AF. SR's consistently eluded him, but he improved his entire timesheet (all 64 times). Consistently climbing throughout the year, he gained countless POWs and POMs, and also proved his skill beyond any doubt. Nobody else's progress could compare to his in raw numbers.<br><br>In other news, Jay also won the second POW of January 2012. Several top players made strong cuts, but Jay crushed all competition with a staggering 13 PR's. He cut ~1.31 points, or ~11.78% from his AF and subbed 10 in AF--a very rare accomplishment indeed. With a total of 11 POW's now, Jay also happens to have more POW's than anyone else. And with 16 awards and 32 points total, he is now Mario Kart Wii's most decorated karter. Congratulations!<br><br>That'll do it for this update. Happy karting!<br><br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

However, the AF treadmill was on reverse this week due to a player deletion, so every single player on the site got an AF cut. So, to go with this theme, I'll be mentioning everyone in reverse order.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-419~~</font><br>We start off with the reigning queen of high numbers, <font color=yellow>#419 Claire March</font>. Claire pulled off 6 PR's this week and lowered her rank by 1, but still remains on top. And a good bit farther along, <font color=yellow>#277 Josh Miller</font> moved 3 places with 7 PR's.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#80 Sean Owens</font> made an efficient cut of 3 places with 2 PR's, or 1 place per PR taking the default cut into account. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#52 Franco Gubser</font> nabbed another PR this week, though he didn't move anywhere. He's been hovering around the 50 mark for a long time now; maybe he'll break into the 40's again before long.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>In the only group this week that didn't have exactly 1 pair of karters playing, <font color=yellow>#35 Reinier de Jonge</font>, having recently completed his timesheet, decided to reverse the digits of his rank from 53 to 35 with 8 PR's. <font color=yellow>#29 Liam Ashcroft</font> reported 2 PR's but didn't go anywhere at all. <font color=yellow>#28 Ben Hart</font> did, though, also submitting a pair of PR's to jump past Liam from 32nd.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#19 John Brunn</font> submitted 1 PR as usual this week. Since he was past the area of players who got automatic promotions, he didn't move, but he did strengthen his position a bit. <font color=yellow>#12 Ruby Aruba</font> did likewise but with 4 PR's instead; he's now only 3/4 of a point away from #10 Tony Ros. Perhaps we'll see him in that elite group again sometime soon.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Finally, among the last 10 karters, we find <font color=yellow>#8 Thomas van Deerse</font>. Thomas boldly leapfrogged 3 players with 5 PR's to prove himself worthy of joining the group. And last but not least, <font color=yellow>#2 Jay Batten</font> used his 2 PR's to inch ever closer to becoming MKWii's #1.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>No new ones this week, though 4 SR's were reassigned because of that player deletion. Champ Jorge Hernandez now has 10 SR's as a result, twice as many as second-place Romain Smadja. Jazz Ahmed and Dylan Imhoff also put in an appearance with 1 SR apiece.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>3rd POW of January - <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font> Thomas took advantage of a quiet week to break into the Top 10 with 6 PR's. ~2.81 points, or ~8.67% of his total AF, were enough to propel him forward 4 places to #8.<br><br><br>See you guys next update!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

It's been a pretty busy week, so there's plenty of activity to cover.<br><br>Recently, it came to our attention that standards on the combined charts were being displayed incorrectly for players who only had NonSC times, showing their NonSC standards instead of Combined standards. This problem has been corrected now.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br><font color=lime>John Cwusha</font> joined at approximately 221st with 34 times, including a Top 10 time on Mario Circuit glitched.<br><font color=lime>Mark Frank</font> only had 28 times to start off. His theoretical rank is 398th for now.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>After a brief slump last week, activity rebounded strongly, with 33 players picking up their controllers.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>As expected, <font color=yellow>#2 Jay Batten</font> continued his relentless pursuit of champ Jorge. He still hasn't claimed any SR's, but he did crank out 8 PR's for a massive .8906 AF cut, roughly 9.5% of his total. He also became only the second player to reach Myth rank, a rare feat indeed. Just below, <font color=yellow>#4 Nick Meade</font> got a PR, though it didn't help his AF too much. <font color=yellow>#8 Thomas van Deerse</font>, who recently joined the Top 10, didn't have much more luck, though he reported 2 PR's. <font color=yellow>#10 Ruby Aruba</font> on the other hand, made plenty of progress; he cut .8906 points, the same as Jay, and passed two karters to make it in the Top 10, knocking Tony Ros out in the process.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Surprisingly, former champion <font color=yellow>#13 David McPartland</font> apparently got a time updated last week, though I have no idea how old it was. <font color=yellow>#18 John Brunn</font> put on a turn of speed and pulled off 6 PR's, enough to cut almost a whole AF point and move up another spot. And <font color=yellow>#20 Alvin Le</font> earned 1 PR, though it wasn't enough to overcome his AF loss.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#26 Ben Hart</font> made a nice ~1.78 AF cut with 4 PR's to jump 2 spots and land right on the doorstep of the Top 25. Meanwhile, another former champ, <font color=yellow>#31 Alvin van Asselt</font> got a flap updated, just like Bubbles in the next group up. It was worth a good bit of AF, but he still didn't quite break even. <font color=yellow>#32 Reinier de Jonge</font> pulled a magic trick this week, cutting multiple points of AF and 3 places with just 1 PR. In contrast, <font color=yellow>#37 Dave Tandy</font> made a good cut in AF with 6 PR's but stayed right where he was. <font color=yellow>#46 Max Anosova</font>, after another name change, pulled off 5 PR's for a 1 place move. And joining the group this week, <font color=yellow>#48 Leo Petiard</font> climbed 5 places with 8 PR's and a 2.875 AF cut.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>There's very little to talk about in this group. <font color=yellow>#53 Franco Gubser</font> earned a PR, but he lost ground in AF and a place in the rankings. Lower down, <font color=green>#84 Carter Clem</font> finally finished his timesheet, and is off to a good start. And...that's it for the Top 100.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Just below the 2-digit threshhold, <font color=yellow>#103 Ashley O'Hara</font> got his Luigi Circuit time updated, though he was demoted by Mr. Clem above. <font color=yellow>#125 Dexter Howe</font> came up with 2 PR's, just barely making a net gain in AF and staying put in the rankings. <font color=yellow>#126 Tom Norton</font> has been hard at work chasing the N64 Sherbet Land WR for a while now, but he still found time to update 13 of his times this week and jump 11 places. <font color=yellow>#157 Juanki Vecino Duena</font> did an even bigger update of 35 times, shooting up 58 places and knocking off a whopping 84.625 points of AF. Down in the lower ranks, where active players are few and far between, <font color=yellow>#201 Daniel Crutcher</font> made a good 9 position move with 7 PR's. <font color=yellow>#274 Josh Miller</font> made a 3 place improvement with 10 PR's. And finally, way down at the end, <font color=yellow>#419 Claire March</font> pulled out a 39 PR improvement to cut ~.41 AF and finally moved forward a place to leave Peter Ferguson at the bottom of the ladder again. We'll see if she continues her progress in weeks to come.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>3 new Site Records this update. N64 Sherbet Land Course was the only one to change hands, increasing Sword's total to 4 for tied 3rd place and lowering Jorge's total to 9.<br><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time of 2'17\"331 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'17\"317</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat Jorge Hernandez's old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land crs</font> time of 2'04\"369 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'04\"353</font><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud </font>improved his own <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium crs</font> time of 1'49\"659 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"353</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>4th POW of January: <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font> - Active as always, Jay came up with an impressive 8 PR's for a .8906 AF cut, or 9.5159% of his total, and also became Myth D rank.<br>January POM: <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font> - With 24 PR's, Jay edged out Thomas van Deerse for this award. He took off more than a quarter of his total AF with a cut of 2.9062 AF points, subbed 10 in AF, and attained Myth D rank.<br><br><br>That's all for now.

Pretty standard stuff for these guys, with no change in rank.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Outside the Top 10, there was some actual movement going on. <font color=yellow>#17 John Brunn</font> cut the smallest amount of AF possible this week with 2 PR's and passed Fabien Jacques. <font color=yellow>#19 Salvatore Bellusci</font> moved up 3 places to sandwich Fabien from below, with 5 new PR's. The biggest mover this week was crazy Dutchman <font color=yellow>#23 Reinier de Jonge</font>, who has been working hard to balance his timesheet.

And it's a good thing he did, because breathing down his neck is <font color=red>#9 Ruby Aruba</font>, who also PR'ed twice but cut ~0.66 AF instead.

Jay made a small AF cut with 5 PR's, but Jorge updated 7 times to knock off almost a full point and pull his AF under 6. On a side note, he's also pushed his Mario Kart Wii score on the Combined Rankings past the 2 point mark, which means that his AF is currently less than one hundredth the score of the lowest ranked karter, Claire March. Meanwhile, down at the other end of the group, <font color=yellow>#8 Thomas van Deerse</font> and <font color=yellow>#9 Ruby Aruba</font> also played as a pair. Each of them scored 2 PR's, but Thomas cut .1406 AF, as opposed to Aruba's .0625, which allowed Thomas to pull away a bit. They're still separated by less than .1, and neither of them shows signs of slowing yet.

No doubt more karters will fall victim to the crazy Dutchman in weeks to come. And finally, out in the vast sea of inactivity, <font color=yellow>#48 Franco Gubser</font> finally triumphed this week in his struggle to rejoin the Top 50. He only came up with 1 PR, but it was enough to cut more than half a point of AF and jump 3 places, making him the only player other than Rein to gain places this week. Good work, Franco!<br><br><font color=red>All those other guys...</font><br>...didn't play this week. Yes, I'm serious--there were no signs of life anywhere outside the Top 50.

The other guy who played was <font color=yellow>#198 Rob Jon</font>, who worked to get 7 PR's and cut ~5.5 AF, but since he was caught in an AF graveyard, he still got a rank demotion because of Chris. He still has more than 6 points ahead of him to the next karter, but if he keeps on working at it, he'll make it.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>None this week.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>4th POW of February: <font color=yellow>Ruby Aruba</font> - With almost no competition, Aruba easily wins this award, moving from #9 - #8 with 2 PR's.

He got within .644 of the WR with only 2/3 glitch SC's, which earned him a small AF cut. German Champion <font color=yellow>#6 Dustin Enders</font> did likewise, but his PR was an actual Flap WR. He beat #5 Marc Bas to achieve it, but he's still a long way off from the French Champ in terms of AF.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>The rest of the Top 25 didn't show much activity. <font color=yellow>#19 John Brunn</font> had the field to himself this week; he knocked off just over 1% of his AF with 2 PR's, and got quite close to #18 Reinier de Jonge.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Just the usual suspects were busy in this group. <font color=yellow>#32 Leo Petiard</font> made a solid 5 PR effort, which got him about halfway through the AF graveyard he was facing at the start of the week. And just behind him, <font color=yellow>#33 Dave Tandy</font> made a queer-looking move of 3 places with 3 PR's. He moved up right next to Leo on the rankings, but since he only cut .5 AF, he fell further behind Leo in AF. I'm not sure whether you'd count that as being closer or farther away, but regardless, it's progress!<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>In a shocking turn of events, the lower half of the Top 100 wasn't dead this week! <font color=yellow>#67 Andre Hoelscher</font> and <font color=yellow>#86 Frederick Hutchington</font> both returned to update some of their times. Andre submitted 4, which bumped him up 1 spot and cut almost 2 points of AF, while Frederick jumped up 3 places with 5 PR's and cut over 4 points.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Just knocking at the door of the Top 100 is <font color=yellow>#103 Christian W</font>. He must have been super busy this week, because he pocketed no fewer than 17 PR's, enough to shoot forward 11 places. He wasn't the only Chris playing for Germany this week, as <font color=yellow>#135 Christian Nemetz</font> returned as well, moving forward 1 place with 5 new times. The largest move resulting from a mass update of times, though, belongs to <font color=yellow>#144 Aubrey Clissold</font>. He rocketed up 39 places with 20 PR's, though it seems that none of them were on Koopa Cape. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#172 Eric Shore</font> contented himself with climbing 2 places with 3 PR's, despite being passed by Aubrey. <font color=yellow>#186 Daniel Crutcher</font> was the last of the players making massive updates this week, with his 27 new times catapulting him forward 14 places. Just below where Daniel moved from, right outside the Top 200, <font color=yellow>#201 Tony Fan</font> demonstrated his superior prowess with karts with 2 new PR's on DK Summit, though they didn't keep him from backsliding in AF. And finally, out past the 400 marker, <font color=green>#413 Krystian Wieczorek</font> made his humble debut on the AF charts this week. He plays a number of other Mario Kart games as well, so it remains to be seen if he'll find time for Mario Kart Wii in the future.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>This week, Dused stole Marco's only remaining SR to take his place among the 25 other 1-record wonders.<br><br><font color=yellow>Dustin Enders </font>beat Marc Bas's old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory lap</font> time of 0'35\"163 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"160</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>1st POW of March: <font color=yellow>Leo Petiard</font> - With a solid 5 PR's, Leo subbed 60 in AF and cut ~1.77 points of AF, almost half the gap to the karter ahead of him.<br><br><br>That's it for this update.

He also cut ~.2 AF, though he didn't move up. <font color=chartreuse>#41 Max Anosova</font> did, however, climbing 2 places with 2 PR's.

The luck o' the Irish must have been with him, because this comes right after another large set of new PR's last week. He cut ~18.7 points of AF, too, more than anyone else this week. <font color=green>#260 Russell Horwood</font> is another newcomer to the AF chart; after joining last week with some cups missing from his timesheet, he filled out the rest to earn a rank of Intermediate A. He doesn't have far to go to join the Experts now. And finally, <font color=chartreuse>#425 Claire March</font> noticed that she'd slipped back down to the bottom position on the chart and decided to fix that with 11 PR's. Her numbered position and AF still took a hit from the new arrivals, of course, but she did manage to pass Peter Ferguson once again.

However, competition for the German crown has heated up suddenly, as <font color=yellow>#8 Artur Bauer</font> rapidly closes in on <font color=yellow>#6 Dustin Enders</font>. Dustin took the European Record on Toad's Factory this week, but it didn't save him from falling back a bit in AF. Artur, on the other hand, returned after several weeks of silence to update a quarter of his timesheet, or 16 PR's. He leaped straight into the Top 10 from #12 and is now less than 2 AF away from his fellow German.

Rein has made sudden improvements before, though, so he could turn the tables very quickly.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#31 Leo Petiard</font> was active as usual. He made a small AF cut and passed Alvin van Asselt with 1 PR. <font color=yellow>#47 Franco Gubser</font> passed 1 player as well, thanks to 2 PR's. And right behind him, <font color=yellow>#49 Sebastian Kovats</font> noticed that he'd fallen out of the Top 50 since his last visit and decided to fix that. Armed with 8 new times, he passed 3 karters and broke back into the Top 50.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>In contrast to all that movement we just covered, <font color=yellow>#66 Ross Coleman</font> hardly moved at all. With his 1 PR, he reduced his AF backslide to a miniscule amount, which is better than doing nothing at all. <font color=yellow>#84 Frederick Hutchington</font> got a pair of PR's on N64 Bowser's Castle to the tune of ~3.3 AF cut and 3 places gained. <font color=yellow>#85 Carter Clem</font> almost lost a place because of this, but with 1 PR of his own, he was able to cut AF and hold his position.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#101 Christian W</font> is probably a tad irritated right now. He PR'ed no fewer than 11 times and cut just over 3 points of AF, but he still wasn't able to enter the Top 100. He's less than half a point away, though, so he doesn't have far to go now. <font color=yellow>#112 Martin Prigent</font> sent in 5 new times, enough to pass 2 players and cut almost 2 AF. <font color=yellow>#167 Daniel Crutcher</font> also moved up 2 spots, though he did it with 4 PR's. Much farther down, <font color=yellow>#396 Michael Vogt</font> made a nice move of 12 places with 12 PR's to break into the Top 400.

Dustin eked out 1 PR, but it proved insufficient in the face of Artur's 6, which earned him a cut of exactly two and a quarter points of AF. Dustin has been known to hoard times in the past, though, so don't be too surprised if he comes storming back next week with a dozen PR's.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#16 Reinier de Jonge</font> was up to his usual tricks. This time, he passed 2 karters with 2 PR's, both on Peach Beach. <font color=yellow>#18 John Brunn</font> was active as well, with 4 PR's, but though he cut AF, he couldn't keep Rein from passing him. And coming up behind them is <font color=yellow>#20 Salvatore Bellusci</font>. He had been quiet for a while, but came back with 6 PR's to pass Fabien Jacques for a Top 20 position. And just below, <font color=yellow>#24 Leo Petiard</font> submitted no fewer than 16 PR's, which catapulted him past 7 karters, right into the Top 25.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#30 Liam Ashcroft</font> came up with a new PR for the first time in quite a while. It didn't allow him to cut AF, but it did lessen his loss--a good thing for him, because <font color=yellow>#31 Dave Tandy</font> sent in a batch of 16 PR's and is now breathing down Liam's neck. Dave only passed two karters, but he did cut ~5.6 AF. And <font color=yellow>#38 Robert van Zanten</font> reported a new Mario Circuit Lap Site Record, which helped him cut his AF losses a bit as well.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>The lower half of the Top 100 saw a good bit of activity--a pleasant change from the usual graveyard scene. <font color=yellow>#62 Andre Hoelscher</font> asserted his place among the living with a solid 6 PR's, enough to cut ~3.6 AF and move forward a place. <font color=yellow>#66 Ross Coleman</font> looked like he wanted to make a run for it, but tripped and fell flat on his face after just 1 PR, becoming the only active player in the group to lose ground in AF. <font color=yellow>#68 Dilan Arse</font>, however, sprinted past a dozen fallen karters with 16 PR's. <font color=yellow>#79 Carter Clem</font> came up with 6 PR's, enough to pass exactly that many players. <font color=yellow>#83 Frederick Hutchington</font> reported 2 PR's, earning the right to shuffle forward 1 place. And rounding out the group, we have a new face in the Top 100, <font color=yellow>#99 Christian W</font>. He sent in 8 PR's to pass 2 players and finally break free from the largely ignored triple-digit ranks.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#101 Sam Smith</font> was the unlucky victim of Mr. W's move. Sam's luck in breaking into the Top 50 of MK7 apparently didn't carry over to MKWii and the Top 100, as he tried to hold his ground with 2 PR's but was pushed out anyway. The rest of the active players were very widely spread out across the 100's, 200's, and 300's. <font color=yellow>#150 Daniel Crutcher</font> submitted a set of 23 PR's, which bumped him up 17 places. <font color=yellow>#200 Rob Jon</font> had also been hard at work. He PR'ed 11 times, cut ~4.5 AF, and...didn't move anywhere at all. At least he's past the better part of the AF chasm, now. <font color=yellow>#223 Florian Truetschel</font> sent in a large batch of times as well--25, to be exact. He jumped forward 21 places, with a nice ~26 point cut to his AF. <font color=yellow>#234 Julian Stephens</font> moved at a more sedate pace, content to simply cut ~1.9 AF with 4 PR's and maintain his current rank (though it's not nearly as cool without the 1). <font color=yellow>#260 Russell Horwood</font> was the only active player outside the Top 100 to lose ground in AF, perhaps because he only PR'ed twice. At least he didn't fall back quite as much as the karters around him. <font color=yellow>#359 Stephen de Winter</font> made perhaps the most efficient move. Amidst all the karters forging ahead with massive quantities of PR's, Stephen managed to cut exactly three and a half points of AF and leapfrog 3 karters with just 2 PR's. And finally, <font color=yellow>#384 Michael Vogt</font> cut just over 28 points of AF with that many PR's, enough to shoot past 12 players. It's a lot easier to make those big cuts in the lower ranks, so enjoy them while you can.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>There was just one new Site Record this week.

Dustin rolled out 5 PR's in his move to reclaim his German crown, but Artur cut more than twice as much AF with 6 PR's, stretching his lead to more than 1 AF.

And rounding out the group, <font color=yellow>#24 Dave Tandy</font> sent in his usual periodical batch of hoarded PR's. His grand total this time was 26, which cut almost 7 points of AF and sent him rocketing forward that many places, straight into the Top 25.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>The lower half of the Top 50 wasn't quite so lucky when it came to moving forward. <font color=yellow>#31 Liam Ashcroft</font> PR'ed twice but couldn't overcome the AF treadmill, and lost a position to Dave to boot. <font color=yellow>#34 Max Anosova</font> was the only player in the group to move forward, thanks to a dozen hoarded PR's. He leapfrogged 6 karters and cut ~3.56 AF. <font color=yellow>#41 Matthias Sempels</font> and <font color=yellow>#47 Franco Gubser</font> were left in the dust; they each PR'ed once (and Matthias actually could have passed Max if he had stayed where he was), but they ended up taking a net loss in AF.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Progress picks up again outside the Top 50. <font color=yellow>#54 Andre Hoelscher</font> made terrific progress with 10 PR's, jumping forward 8 places and reaching King A rank in ARR. <font color=yellow>#67 Dilan Arse</font> didn't do too badly himself, gaining one place with 5 PR's and cutting almost a full point of AF. <font color=yellow>#76 Carter Clem</font> used his 5 PR's to climb 3 places, while <font color=yellow>#93 Viktor Silivanov</font> improved 5 spots with 10 PR's. <font color=yellow>#99 Christian W</font> finishes the group; his rank didn't change, but he did cut ~3.6 AF with 12 PR's.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#108 Martin Prigent</font> found some time to play MKWii again recently. It seems he still had MK7 on the brain, though, as he stopped at a lucky 7 PR's. He cut about 4 points of AF and exactly that many places. A bit lower down, <font color=yellow>#136 Evan Simmons</font> returned after a long absence to update 25 of his times. This resulted in an AF cut of exactly 47 and a half points--the most by far in terms of percentages (though not in raw points), and enough to blaze past 32 karters. <font color=green>#144 Qi Zhu</font> is a newcomer to the full AF chart; he's been on the site for a while now, but only recently found time to complete his set of times, earning a solid rank on the chart. <font color=yellow>#149 Daniel Crutcher</font> was the most conservative mover of the post-100 field; he settled for just 2 new PR's, moving up only 1 spot. <font color=yellow>#170 Murray Wright</font>, like Evan above, had been absent for some time, but he popped up unexpectedly with 26 new PR's, shooting forward 16 places. <font color=yellow>#191 Rob Jon</font> was determined to make some progress this week after being stymied earlier. Throwing superstition to the winds, he submitted exactly 13 PR's, including a large batch on Friday the 13th, and went up 9 places to cement himself in the Top 200. Continuing on down the line, we find that <font color=yellow>#256 Russell Horwood</font> was hard at work as well. He improved to the tune of 20 PR's, which netted him a 4 place improvement. And finally, <font color=yellow>#364 Krystian Wieczorek</font> also got 20 PR's, which catapulted him forward 50 places and cut ~76.6 points from his AF, the most this update. We'll see if he can add MKWii to his list of karting conquests in the future.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>None.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>2nd POW of April: <font color=yellow>Andre Hoelscher</font> - Though there was a good bit of activity among the top players, Andre outshined them all. 10 PR's netted him an 8 place improvement and an ~8.67 point/~9.46% AF cut, the best in the Top 100.<br>3rd POW of April:  <font color=yellow>John Brunn</font>- With little activity and only a few hoarders as his competition, John stepped up this week. 4 PRs bringing a 1.7 AF cut and a two place improvement, he ran away with the award this week.<br><br><br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

They each PR'ed 4 times, and though Jay briefly closed the gap between them to 1 AF, Jorge quickly pulled away and brought his AF under 6 points again. <font color=yellow>#5 Marc Bas</font> also made an unexpected return, cutting exactly 1/8 of a point of AF with a PR on Shy Guy Beach. The only player in the Top 10 to improve his rank, though, was <font color=yellow>#8 Thomas van Deerse</font>, who passed 2 players by cutting nearly 3 AF with 11 PR's. He doesn't have much further to go to pass a couple more karters, and knowing Thomas, he'll probably have it done in no time.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Moving on, we find <font color=yellow>#16 John Brunn</font> plodding along as usual. He picked up 4 PR's for a modest half point AF cut, which was enough to cross the 40 AF threshold. <font color=yellow>#18 Salvatore Bellusci</font> isn't too far behind; with 8 PR's, he knocked ~1.4 points off his AF and passed Australian champ Jimmy Benson. <font color=yellow>#21 Leo Petiard</font> was the busiest player this update, though; with 19 PR's, he cut just over 5 points of AF, or nearly 10% of his total, allowing him to jump forward 4 places. <font color=yellow>#24 Alvin Le</font> was one of the unlucky karters displaced by this move, but he did manage to mitigate his AF losses with a return similar to Marco's, also earning a PR on Shy Guy Beach.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Activity takes a bit of a dip here. <font color=yellow>#31 Liam Ashcroft</font> improved his Peach Beach time, earning a higher rank on the Worldwide Top 10 but not doing much damage control on the AF front. <font color=yellow>#47 Franco Gubser</font> was the only other player active in the Top 50. He used his 3 PR's to strengthen his position and move up on Daniel Anderson and the next cluster of karters.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>To start off this group, we have a pair of karters who broke the 100 AF barrier. <font color=yellow>#65 Dilan Arse</font> and <font color=yellow>#66 Sean Owens</font> were far apart before this update, but are now next-door neighbors, thanks to a big 17 PR's from Sean that pushed him forward 16 places. Arsenic didn't do too badly himself, gaining 2 places with 6 PR's. Just below in the 70's bracket, <font color=yellow>#76 Carter Clem</font> came up with 3 PR's, which would have bumped him up a spot but didn't due to Sean flying past him. And rounding out the group, <font color=yellow>#91 Christian W</font> followed Sean's lead and moved 8 places to buddy up with <font color=yellow>#92 Jon Coppernoll</font>. Jon was none too pleased with this arrangement, as he had to give up a position to Christian, but his 3 PR's couldn't compete with Christian's round dozen.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>With no rookies to add to the ranks, the post-100 field didn't have much activity to speak of. <font color=yellow>#103 Martin Prigent</font> seems to be taking advantage of this by passing up as many inactive karters as he can. He managed to pass 5 of them with 8 PR's, but there's a decent-sized gap after the next player, Noah Gordon, so Martin will have to keep working hard if he wants to make it into the Top 100. <font color=yellow>#113 Evan Simmons</font> may have designs on the Top 100 as well; with his 15 PR's, he cut nearly 30 points of AF and jumped forward 23 places. And finally, <font color=yellow>#145 Daniel Crutcher</font> made an efficient 4 place cut with just 2 PR's, pulling away from both the 150 border and the 200 AF mark.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Three Site Records were improved, which is about the average rate these days. The one record to change hands was taken from Tony Ros by none other than Jay Batten, finally getting him onto the SR table. Tony was left with two, which dropped him to tied 6th place in the rankings.<br><br><font color=yellow>Sam Fairless </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'30\"769 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'30\"369</font><br><font color=yellow>Jay Batten </font>beat Tony Ros's <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'04\"984 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'04\"361</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>improved his own <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'13\"097 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'13\"023</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>4th POW of April: <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font> - Jay kept up his brisk pace this week with 4 PR's, more than most other karters in the Top 100. With this cut, he cut down Jorge's lead to less than 1 AF for the first time in about a year.<br>April POM: <font color=yellow>Artur Bauer</font> - For the second month in a row, Artur took a break from his usual hoarding and started PR'ing rapidly, racking up 12 in all and moving from #8 -> #6.

His starting set of 30 course times would be enough on their own for 258th place, though the addition of lap times would ensure further cuts.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Activity rebounded this update, as no fewer than 30 players sent in new times, including a few returning from sabbaticals. It looks like Mario Kart Wii has life in it yet!<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>The biggest news this update is that <font color=yellow>#2 Jay Batten</font> is now less than half a point of AF away from champ Jorge. Despite already being so highly ranked, he accumulated an astounding 15 PR's during this 2-week period, cutting exactly 10% from his AF. Jorge has shown signs of fighting back, so stay tuned--things are about to get interesting.<br>In other news, <font color=yellow>#5 Marc Bas</font> was one of several players who made a comeback this May, and he continued his activity in the latter half of the month with 1 PR, though he still has a long way to go to reach #4 Nick Meade. <font color=yellow>#7 Thomas van Deerse</font> turned up as well, earning a cut of ~.7 AF with 4 PR's.

And rounding out and stretching beyond the Top 25, we have a long string of consecutive active karters. <font color=yellow>#23 Cole Gilbert</font>, <font color=yellow>#24 Alvin Le</font>, <font color=yellow>#25 Dave Tandy</font>, and <font color=yellow>#26 Matthieu Mayer</font> all sent in varying numbers of PR's for varying AF cuts, Dave's hoarded dozen being the largest of the submissions. Since they weren't too close together to begin with and all moved in the same direction, they all kept their original ranks, though since they're now clustered quite close together, there's likely to be a shakeup before long.<br><br><font color=red>~~27-50~~</font><br>Since I broke my grouping system and lumped Matthieu into the group above, <font color=yellow>#31 Liam Ashcroft</font> gets this paragraph all to himself. He used his 2 PR's to exactly halve his AF losses, his rank remaining unchanged. And that's it for the Top 50!<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Some more familiar faces greet us as we continue on through the Top 100. <font color=yellow>#53 Andre Hoelscher</font> made a nice cut of ~4 AF with 9 PR's, working his way up one rank. <font color=yellow>#65 Sean Owens</font> and <font color=yellow>#66 Dilan Arse</font> found themselves wedged together after the last update, and they stayed that way this update, though they somehow managed to switch positions despite Dilan PR'ing twice as many times as Sean. Arsenic took a hit in AF while Sean gained ground with just 2 PR's, but they're both still under the 100 AF mark for now. Down below, <font color=yellow>#88 Christian W</font> made a solid cut of ~3.8 AF with 12 PR's, passing 3 players as he ventures deeper into the Top 100. <font color=yellow>#92 Viktor Silivanov</font> marks the end of the group's activity, with 4 PR's securing a 2 place cut.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#102 Martin Prigent</font> kicks off the post-100 activity, with 4 PR's bringing him ~2.9 AF and 1 place closer to the Top 100. A bit farther out, <font color=yellow>#119 Luke Berrill</font> showed up again after a long break, turning in 9 PR's for a 1 place improvement. <font color=yellow>#123 Daniel Crutcher</font> won the competition for sheer volume of PR's this update, with a massive load of 29 shooting him forward ~27.7 AF and 22 places. <font color=yellow>#152 Blake Germany's</font> got a new SR on DKSC lap this update, but it didn't help his AF much. <font color=yellow>#160 Fabio Sacco</font> was in a similar situation with 2 less-lofty PR's, but any small cut to offset the treadmill effect is better than nothing. <font color=yellow>#163 Murray Wright</font> sent in the second-largest batch of PR's this update after Daniel's--25 in all--though he \"only\" improved by 7 places and ~15.5 AF. And finally, <font color=yellow>#262 Josh Miller</font> joined the throng of returning players with 10 PR's, climbing up 4 places.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>A lot of Site Records fell during the second half of May--6 in all--and most of them changed hands as well. In the shakeup of SR totals that resulted, Jay claimed his second SR, though he still doesn't have any WR's so far. Cole completed his set of rPB records by snagging the flap, while MG specialist Sam Fairless did likewise on his own course. Blake once again took his friend Ethan's place on the SR table by claiming the DKSC lap record. And finally, John Brunn came up with a new strat for the MH lap and, after a brief battle with Jimbo and a few others, managed to claim and retain the record to earn his place on the SR table. The other players who lost SR's were Paul-Philipp Baehr, Nick Meade, and Romain Smadja (who fell into a 3-way tie for 2nd with Sword and Lee, with 4 SR's left).<br><br><br><font color=yellow>Sam Fairless </font>beat Paul-Philipp Baehr's <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'09\"174 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"146</font><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>beat Ethan McCormac's <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font> time of 0'35\"298 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"251</font><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> time of 1'48\"275 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'48\"008</font><br><font color=yellow>John Brunn </font>beat Jamie Disley's <font color=orange>Moonview Highway lap</font> time of 0'33\"322 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"195</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat Romain Smadja's old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach lap</font> time of 0'22\"447 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'22\"445</font><br><font color=yellow>Jay Batten </font>beat Nick Meade's <font color=orange>N64 Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'31\"752 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'31\"694</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>3rd POW of May: <font color=yellow>Leo Petiard</font> - Despite neither earning the most PR's nor improving his rank, Leo had the best non-hoarded AF cut in the Top 100 by a comfortable margin, knocking off ~1.92 points/~4.11% with 5 PR's.<br>4th POW of May: <font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci</font> - There was fierce competition among various top players this week, but Salvatore just barely edges out the others by virtue of more consistent updating.

Out of all of them, only <font color=lime>Kosta Nasiovas</font> is equipped with a full timesheet so far, the highlight of them being a sub 1:32 on GCN Mario Circuit. Currently ranked #124 in AF, he seems to be off to a solid start.<br><br>Koopa Cape specialist <font color=lime>Raiga Ozaki</font> also distinguished himself from the other joiners. He only submitted 10 times, but one of them was the new Koopa Cape SR. Combined his other times, it guarantees him at least 381st.<br><br>The other new players, their number of submitted times, and their theoretical ranks are:<br><font color=lime>Sergio Garcia</font>: 26 times, 288th<br><font color=lime>Jeremi Husson</font>: 33 times, 291st<br><font color=lime>Colin Koenig</font>: 32 times, 308th<br><font color=lime>Oriol Solsona</font>: 32 times, 336th<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>The advent of summer in the northern hemisphere brought on a flood of karting activity, with no fewer than 58 players active. As is often the case, a lot of the activity was near the top, and a lot of SR's were cut down as well. Oh, and there was also the small matter of the battle for the crown...<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>So, as you all know, there's been a lengthy battle going on between our top two players, <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font> and <font color=yellow>Jorge Hernandez</font>. Time and time again, Jay would approach Jorge's lofty throne, only to be rebuffed yet again. But Jay never gave up, continually improving, focusing on cutting AF rather than accumulating WR's. Jorge put up fierce resistance, improving 18 of his times and plunging his AF under the 5 point mark for the first time in many months. But Jay did likewise with his own PR's, which numbered 31 in all--nearly half his timesheet! And so, after a reign of more than 400 consecutive days--the longest single span in MKWii history--Jorge was dethroned. Congratulations to our new champion, <font color=red>J</font><font color=white>a</font><font color=#6060FF>y</font> <font color=red>B</font><font color=white>a</font><font color=#6060FF>t</font><font color=red>t</font><font color=white>e</font><font color=#6060FF>n</font>!<br><br>The other players in the Top 10 weren't completely idle themselves, though their activity had nothing on Jay and Jorge. <font color=yellow>#3 Shaun Tanney</font> managed a couple PR's, though he still lost ground in AF. French champion <font color=yellow>#5 Marc Bas</font> was also active, actually cutting AF with his 3 PR's. Dutch star <font color=yellow>#6 Thomas van Deerse</font> has his eye on Marc; he cut over a full point of AF with 9 PR's and passed German champ Artur Bauer. There's still a gap of more than 6 points ahead of Thomas, though, so Marc probably isn't worried yet. <font color=yellow>#9 Jak Russo</font> PR'ed only once, but it was a pretty good PR--a Site Record, in fact. It was also enough for him to cut a bit of AF. And finally, <font color=yellow>#10 Ruby Aruba</font> came up with a few PR's this month, but they weren't enough to keep his AF from slipping a bit.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#15 Matthieu Mayer</font> seems to be following in Jay's footsteps, racking up PR's left and right. He scored 29 in all, enough to chop more than 27% off his AF and jump back into the Top 20 all the way from #26. <font color=yellow>#17 Salvatore Bellusci</font> and <font color=yellow>#18 John Brunn</font> were both victims of this move, but they both stayed active to cut AF and prevent any further losses. And indeed, they shouldn't rest easy, as <font color=yellow>#19 Leo Petiard</font> is hot on their tails now. He mustered an impressive 19 PR's to gain 2 places despite being passed by Matthieu. Swiss champion <font color=yellow>#23 Alvin Le</font> also defied the odds, improving his rank by 1 despite barely cutting any AF.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50?~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#28 Liam Ashcroft</font> has been putting a good deal of time into GCN Peach Beach lately, but he apparently still found time to improve 6 different times in all, passing 3 players. <font color=yellow>#32 Clement Rouchon</font> sent in a big batch of 19 PR's, bounding forward 11 places and cutting over 10 AF. <font color=yellow>#41 Zane Royal</font> was bumped down a spot by Clement's move. His 2 PR's didn't help his AF much, either, but did garner some recognition over in the SR department. And down at the 50 border, <font color=yellow>#48 Sebastian Kovats</font> and <font color=yellow>#49 Andre Hoelscher</font> pushed forward 1 and 4 ranks respectively to sandwich Marvin Rekovsky between them in the rankings list. What's that? You say there's no position in between 48th and 49th? Well, you see, Marvin started the month at 48th, but Sebastian managed to get ahead of him, while Andre moved up from outside the Top 50 to precisely tie Marvin but appears immediately below him in the AF rankings. So, technically, Marvin does appear right in between them. And that finishes off the Top 50!...Or is it the Top 49? Whatever, let's just move on. :P<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Veteran <font color=yellow>#54 Gary Marcoz</font> unexpectedly got a large portion of his timesheet updated--23 times in all. He cut over 20 points and 20% off his AF and rocketed forward 15 places. <font color=yellow>#58 Danny Gallenberger</font> made a slight return to Mario Kart Wii, just enough to earn 1 PR. He didn't overcome the AF treadmill, though, and lost a position to boot because of Gary. <font color=yellow>#65 Sean Owens</font> also lost more ground than he gained, but at least his rank remained unchanged. <font color=yellow>#71 Carter Clem</font> seemed to be having some trouble maintaining access to a functional Wii this month, but he still managed to forge past 5 more karters, and with only 3 PR's, too. His impressive efficiency makes a striking contrast to <font color=yellow>#85 Christian W</font>'s June activity, as he PR'ed 14 times but only gained 3 places. Player spacing is largely to blame, as Christian did cut a tidy ~4.8 AF. <font color=yellow>#89 Jon Coppernoll</font> had to overcome a ~3.5 AF gap himself after overtaking 1 karter, but he managed to reach the other side and pass 3 more players, for a 4 place gain overall. And rounding out the group, we have a new face in the Top 100, <font color=yellow>#94 Daniel Crutcher</font>. Daniel was extremely active in June, cranking out 46 PR's for a ~38 AF cut and 29 place cut, barreling through like a steam train straight into the Top 100. Nice work, Daniel!<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>The Crutcher Express left several disgruntled travelers standing on the platform, watching the train disappear into the Top 100 without them. <font color=yellow>#101 Martin Prigent</font> is one of these unfortunates; making his way forward from #102 in the line, his 9 PR's would have been enough for a ticket into the Top 100, but he got left out in the cold when Daniel grabbed the last seat. <font color=yellow>#102 Loris Bagnasco</font> actually was ranked #100, until Daniel kicked him out and Martin knocked him down another spot, but he at least made a small AF cut. He was luckier than <font color=yellow>#103 Sam Smith</font>, who lost ground in AF as well as positions. He's the third consecutive karter to <i>almost</i> make it into the Top 100, but with Daniel, Martin, and Loris all active, he just dropped 2 places instead. <font color=yellow>#104 Cyril Fulag</font> isn't helping matters for them; as if they weren't all uncomfortable enough, Cyril came out of nowhere with 44 PR's to rocket forward 30 places and latch onto the tail end of the line. Will any of these karters be able to realize their ambitions? Stay tuned...<br><br><font color=yellow>#113 Luke Berrill</font> seems to have returned to the MKW TT scene recently. He submitted improvements to 15 times, clambering over 6 karters. <font color=yellow>#118 Virgil Blondel</font> unexpectedly turned up again as well, though his 1 PR didn't keep him from losing 3 places due to the fallout of Daniel and Cyril's moves. <font color=yellow>#120 Simon Uldry</font> wasn't about to let the terrible two hold him back, though, and cut almost 8 AF with 9 PR's. It was enough to convert his potential loss in positions to a gain of 1. <font color=yellow>#129 Tom Norton</font> had better things to do than worry about silly things like AF, and concentrated instead on getting the Luigi Circuit WR. As expected, his AF didn't benefit much, but despite dropping a rank in AF, he's well on his way to reaching his goal. <font color=yellow>#131 Dexter Howe</font> kept busy as well, though his 2 PR's weren't quite enough to prevent him from losing a place and some ground in AF. <font color=yellow>#138 Qi Zhu</font> improved a quarter of his timesheet for a solid 7 place gain. <font color=yellow>#140 Christian Nemetz</font> wasn't so lucky; he earned 6 PR's and cut a point of AF, but lost 2 places anyway. <font color=yellow>#149 James Leare</font> lost a spot as well, though his 1 PR didn't result in net progress in AF. <font color=yellow>#181 Nicola Torre</font> managed to find some time off from MK7 updating to play MKWii, it seems, and he made quite a nice cut. With just 6 PR's, he skipped ahead 8 places, cutting 12.75 AF. <font color=yellow>#188 Rob Jon</font>'s improvements were more spread out, as he shaved off ~10.8 AF and 3 places with 16 different PR's. <font color=yellow>#203 Pierre Ruffin</font> joined the ever-growing \"Where did you come from, long time no see\" crowd to cut a cool 16.5 AF and 4 places, though, sadly, none of his 9 PR's were on Mushroom Gorge. And last but not least, <font color=yellow>#253 Russell Horwood</font> cut exactly 1 point of AF with 4 PR's, moving up 3 places.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Both SR and WR activity boomed this month along with regular activity. Among the multi-SR holders, Jorge Hernandez</font> lost 1, though with 7 SR's, he still holds more than anyone else. Jay Batten</font> promised to start going after WR's after he gained the AF crown, and he made good on his promise, adding 3 of them to his former 2 and taking 2nd place in SR totals. Lee Duggan lost 1, dropping him to 4th place. Tom Norton fell to tied 5th after losing 2, and was the only player to lose more than 1 SR this month. Zane Royal moved up to join that same 10-way tie, doubling his SR count to 2. Jak Russo, Alex Bjorkman, and Raiga Ozaki made their way onto the table with 1 SR apiece, while Reinier de Jonge, Matthieu Mayer, and Thomas Ullrich lost their last SR's and were kicked off entirely.<br>An honorable mention goes to Kunio Oniku, who held the N64 Mario Raceway Course WR for a period of time in June, but had lost it back to Zane by the time of this update.<br><br><font color=yellow>Jay Batten </font>beat Matthieu Mayer's old <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows crs</font> time of 1'15\"859, had a quick WR battle with Matthieu following that, and came out on top with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'15\"742</font><br><font color=yellow>Sam Fairless </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'30\"369 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'28\"976</font><br><font color=yellow>Sam Fairless </font>also improved his own <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'09\"146 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'08\"440</font><br><font color=yellow>Raiga Ozaki </font>beat Jorge Hernandez's old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> time of 2'20\"374 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'20\"259</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Bjorkman </font>beat Thomas Ullrich's old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 0'19\"578 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'19\"503</font><br><font color=yellow>Jak Russo </font>beat Lee Duggan's old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins lap</font> time of 0'33\"176 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"062</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>improved his own <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'13\"023 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'12\"992</font><br><font color=yellow>Zane Royal </font>defended his <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway crs</font> record, improving his old time of 1'41\"732 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'41\"671</font><br><font color=yellow>Jay Batten </font>beat Reinier de Jonge's old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway lap</font> time of 0'31\"597 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31\"480</font><br><font color=yellow>Jay Batten </font>beat Tom Norton's old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach lap</font> time of 0'25\"247 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'25\"156</font><br><font color=yellow>Zane Royal </font>beat Tom Norton's old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square crs</font> time of 2'05\"167 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'05\"156</font><br><font color=yellow>Luis G </font>improved his own <font color=orange>SNES Mario Circuit 3 crs</font> time of 1'18\"230 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'18\"205</font><br><font color=yellow>Jay Batten </font>improved his own <font color=orange>N64 Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'31\"694 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'31\"645</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>1st POW of June: <font color=yellow>Jay Batten</font> - This was the week that it finally happened.

That person is <font color=red>Cole Gilbert</font>.<br><br>Recently, Cole developed a code that checks for cheaters, basically. It specifically checks for impossibly fast wheelie inputs - if the code detects inhuman input, such as 10 positive wheelie inputs in 20-25 frames, then it is a fact that that player cheated. (The code checks for both rapid fire input and input that indicates the game slowed down and the player button-mashed during the slower fps rate.) It also means that the player lied about the legitimacy of their times and cannot be trusted.<br><br>Already, several players near the top have been caught. Formerly recognized page champion Jay Batten has been removed, and Jorge Hernandez also has been caught using slow downs on rMC. Other top 10 players such as Artur and Dustin have also failed Cole's test.<br><br>So, to those of you who may be watching the AF go through its current upheaval and have no idea what's going on... well, that's what's going on.<br><br><font color=red>Cole</font>, on behalf of everyone here I want to thank you for all the effort you've put into improving this site and competitive MKWii in general.

        "content": "<p><b><font color=red>Update: ? - August 15th</font><br><br><font color=cyan>The Purge</font><br>As you no doubt have noticed, the site rankings have been going through quite the upheaval lately. This is due to the outstanding work of two site veterans, <font color=red>Cole Gilbert</font> and <font color=red>Marcel Felix</font>. Recently, Cole developed a way to examine the inputs of players' ghost data for superhuman inputs. Marcel made testing easier by creating a repository of ghost data from players around the world and also adding a way to automatically test runs for suspicious inputs. Together, they have contributed to the detection of more than half a dozen cheaters on the Players' Page, as well as some non-site players. Shockingly (or perhaps not, for the cynical), the Top 10 alone contained 4 of the players who were removed, including longtime site champion <font color=black>Jorge Hernandez</font> and newly christened champion <font color=black>Jay Batten</font>. As a result, movement through the AF rankings was rendered difficult to track, due to all the deletions. Thus, I hope you will forgive me for some vagueness on the general activity, and also for any possible omissions. I'll be looking mainly at the August 1st - August 15th stats, with brief mention of other accomplishments that I can remember. I will at least list all the Site Records that changed hands, though.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Please welcome: <font color=lime>Luke Hubbard, Tom Linton, Ben Weber, Marc Robin, Michael Penninck, David, Marcel Ulbrich, Stan Barmentloo, Dante Dhillon</font>. Of the 9, only Ben Weber joined with a full timesheet, jumping in at 245th.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Since the Top 10 lost nearly half of its members in one fell swoop, I'm going to go ahead and list all 10 of the players comprising the new Top 10. (I'll return to normal activity reports after this.) We start with <font color=yellow>#1 Shaun Tanney</font>, who has been left wearing the site crown after the departure of the two players ahead of him. At ~11.7 AF, he is just over a full point ahead of American Champion <font color=yellow>#2 Nick Meade</font>. The two have shown some signs of activity, finding new motivation in their newfound ranks. They are both well ahead of <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font>, who hasn't yet put in an appearance to comment on recent events. <font color=yellow>#4 Thomas van Deerse</font> is still active, but he's been in hot water lately for his close ties with Jay. Hopefully the need to remove him as well will not arise. <font color=yellow>#5 Jak Russo</font> has kept busy as well, picking up a new WR on Delfino Square. <font color=yellow>#6 Ruby Aruba</font> is the last of the players who were part of the old Top 10. He sits less than a point behind Jak in AF, and seems poised to make a move on him soon. <font color=yellow>#7 Aziz Abdullah</font> is back in the Top 10 as a result of the removals, though he's shown only slight activity lately. <font color=yellow>#8 John Brunn</font> is the only newcomer to the Top 10 who's never been in it before, and is staying active trying to hold his position as long as he can. <font color=yellow>#9 Tony Ros</font> has been away from the game for a while now; with several players coming up on the Top 10 quite quickly, his newfound position in it may be short-lived. And <font color=yellow>#10 Mark Schmidt</font> has likewise been inactive, probably busy with other Mario Karts, but for now, he once again wears the German crown and the last position in the Top 10. We'll see how long he stays there in weeks to come.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Bearing down on Mark like a steam train is <font color=yellow>#11 Leo Petiard</font>. A good set of PR's has put him less than 1.5 AF away from joining the new Top 10, and he seems intent on reaching that goal. <font color=yellow>#13 Salvatore Bellusci</font> has stayed slightly active, though the AF treadmill seems to be outpacing him for the moment. And <font color=yellow>#16 Alex Shoal</font> managed to pull off the new Peach Beach glitch to earn himself a new 3-Lap WR, but still found time to cut plenty of AF to take advantage of the recent purge.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>The players in this group all seemed to want to stick together in groups, for some reason. Veteran <font color=yellow>#31 Bob Holden</font> and recent addition to the AF charts <font color=yellow>#32 Kiver Kivicious</font> made similar cuts with similar numbers of PR's, ensuring that they would remain next-door neighbors. The other active group was the trio of <font color=yellow>#42 Sean Owens</font>, <font color=yellow>#44 Sebastian Kovats</font>, and <font color=yellow>#45 Franco Gubser</font>. Despite appearances, Sean is indeed right next to Sebastian, because he's actually tied for 42nd with Oliver Martin at the moment. Sean also seems to be the fastest-moving member of the group for now, as he shot past the others with more PR's than the two of them combined. Franco is no stranger to the outside border of the Top 50; we'll see if he can hold his position this time.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#54 Tim van Ham</font> put in an unexpected appearance after a prolonged absence. His PR count remains modest so far, but that could change in coming weeks. <font color=yellow>#62 Carter Clem</font> seems to be keeping up steady progress, as is <font color=yellow>#66 Christian W</font>. <font color=yellow>#73 Frederick Hutchington</font> popped in with a few PR's as well, bumping himself up a few places. <font color=yellow>#74 Daniel Crutcher</font> is right behind him, and has been making good progress for some time now. <font color=yellow>#94 Martin Prigent</font> stayed active to solidify his recently earned position in the Top 100. And <font color=yellow>#99 Qi Zhu</font> jumped into the Top 100 with a large batch of PR's, just barely passing <font color=yellow>#100 Luke Berrill</font>, who had also recently reentered the Top 100 after a hiatus. Luke has stayed active as well lately, so he may strike back soon if Qi isn't careful.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#102 Evan Simmons</font> has crept within striking distance of the Top 100 now. We'll see if he can make the jump soon. <font color=yellow>#110 Kosta Nasiovas</font> is not to be counted out either, as he made a fairly large submission recently and may be playing for more. <font color=yellow>#137 Blake Germany</font> made both DK Summit WR's his own, and may have his sights set on Dry Dry Ruins as well, it seems. <font color=yellow>#142 Murray Wright</font> released a big set of PR's to make a nice jump forward in the rankings. <font color=yellow>#246 Russell Horwood</font> returned to play in the aftermath of the cleanup, and seems to be ready to continue his climb through the ranks. <font color=yellow>#248 Josh Miller</font> joined the growing group of players who made big submissions, moving up a fair way through the ranks. <font color=yellow>#259 John Koh</font> was yet another returning player, but I'm pretty sure he beats all the others, as it's been <i>years</i> since he last submitted times here. He's making good progress now, and seems to be keeping up activity so far. And finally, <font color=yellow>#356 Krystian Wieczorek</font> managed to cut a few places with a few PR's to take a few more steps along the road to the top.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>With Jorge gone, there is no longer any one clearly dominant player on the Site Records table. Romain Smadja and Lee Duggan are currently tied for the lead with 4 SR's apiece. Tom Norton, Nick Meade, and Thomas Petraud are locked in a 3-way tie for 3rd with 3 each. And Max Anosova, Andrew Grieve, Blake Germany, Dave Tandy, Brett Edwards, and Sam Fairless make up the remainder of the players with multiple SR's, the 6 of them being tied for 6th with 2 SR's each.<br><br><font color=lime>New Records</font><br><font color=yellow>Sam Fairless </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'28\"976 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'27\"979</font><br><font color=yellow>Sam Fairless </font>also improved his <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'08\"440 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'07\"289</font><br><font color=yellow>Sean Owens </font>beat Tony Ros's old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'04\"984 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'04\"315</font><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>beat Andrew Grieve's old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross crs</font> time of 1'49\"100 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'48\"853</font><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>also fended off Ethan McCormac on <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font>, improving his old time of 0'35\"251 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"140</font><br><font color=yellow>Lee Duggan </font>beat Jak Russo's old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins lap</font> time of 0'33\"062 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"051</font><br><font color=yellow>Alex Shoal </font>beat Cole Gilbert's old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'12\"992 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'09\"009</font>, thanks to the new glitch.<br><font color=yellow>Dave Tandy </font> took care of the lap counterpart by beating Cole Gilbert's old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach lap</font> time of 0'22\"445 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'16\"744</font><br><font color=yellow>Jak Russo </font>beat Zane Royal's old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square crs</font> time of 2'05\"156 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'05\"070</font><br><font color=yellow>Reinier de Jonge </font>tied Brett Edwards's old <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens crs</font> time of 1'59\"824 (with Auto) with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'59\"824</font> (with Manual) Neat, eh?<br><font color=yellow>Romain Smadja </font>improved his own <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens lap</font> time of 0'38\"544 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"507</font><br><font color=yellow>Dave Tandy </font>beat Tony Ros's old <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain lap</font> time of 0'38\"896 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"683</font><br><br><font color=green>Reassigned Records</font><br><font color=yellow>Kunio Oniku</font> now holds the <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows crs</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>1'15\"966</font><br><font color=yellow>Marc Bas</font> now holds the <font color=orange>Toad's Factory lap</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>0'35\"163</font><br><font color=yellow>Agustin Berrios</font> now holds the <font color=orange>Daisy Ciruit crs</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>1'29\"685</font><br><font color=yellow>Ethan McCormac</font> now holds the <font color=orange>Daisy Ciruit lap</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>0'28\"448</font><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud</font> now holds the <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>2'20\"361</font><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Ullrich</font> now holds the <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano lap</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>0'04\"486</font><br><font color=yellow>Andrew Grieve</font> now holds the <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle crs</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>2'11\"652</font><br><font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci</font> now holds the <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle lap</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>0'42\"563</font><br><font color=yellow>Marvin Donjes</font> now holds the <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>0'48\"092</font><br><font color=yellow>Bapt Johnson</font> now holds the <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway lap</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>0'31\"546</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Anderson</font> now holds the <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land lap</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>0'39\"962</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton</font> now holds the <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach lap</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>0'25\"247</font><br><font color=yellow>Nick Meade</font> now holds the <font color=orange>N64 Bowser's Castle crs</font> record with a time of <font color=magenta>2'31\"752</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>You may have noticed that there are a lot of blanks on the Awards page at the moment.

I just became a time and news updater, in hope to make the MKW Player's Page more active and get back in the swing of awarding POWs and such.

There was a bit of a mix-up with the stats, which resulted in Malleo using the wrong stats to track movement. So, I'm just here to straighten things out.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#1 Shaun Tanney</font> and <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font> were first up. They each submitted a single PR, not enough to cut AF but enough to mitigate their losses. <font color=yellow>#4 Thomas van Deerse</font> put in a full 10 PR's, which cut enough AF to bring him under the 20 point threshold. <font color=yellow>#5 Jak Russo</font> and <font color=yellow>#6 Ruby Aruba</font> sent in 3 and 4 PR's respectively. They both lost ground in AF, but despite his superior number of PR's, Aruba fell back further than Jak, widening the gap between them to more than 1 full point. <font color=yellow>#7 John Brunn</font> moved into the position right behind them with 6 PR's, pulling under the 30 AF threshold and passing #9 Aziz Abdullah. And he wasn't the only one to pass Aziz, as <font color=yellow>#8 Dave Tandy</font> pushed his way into the Top 10. He released a batch of 13 PR's, moving all the way from #15 to join the group.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Leo Petiard</font> made a bid for elite status as well with 10 PR's, but fell just short of his goal due to Dave's move. <font color=yellow>#14 Salvatore Bellusci</font> fell victim to the move as well, losing a place and some ground in AF despite PR'ing twice. <font color=yellow>#16 Alex Shoal</font> stayed where he was in the rankings; his 6 PR's (including a new Peach Beach WR) kept him from falling back as much as the players around him, so I guess that counts as progress, in a way. <font color=yellow>#19 Cole Gilbert</font> made solid progress with 13 PR's, cutting 4.25 AF and moving forward 2 places. And <font color=yellow>#23 Sean Owens</font> and <font color=yellow>#24 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> both joined the Top 25 with big batches of PR's, Sean moving 19 places with 34 PR's and Paul moving 3 places with 15.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Venturing on through the Top 50, we meet a familiar face, <font color=yellow>#30 Alvin van Asselt</font>. Alvin used to be the site champion in the early days of the game, and he came back in style this month. He didn't manage to keep from being passed by Sean, but he did grab both Daisy Circuit WR's out of the blue, proving that he's still deserving of his recognition as one of the all-time greats. <font color=yellow>#31 Kiver Kivicious</font> didn't do too badly himself, nabbing 9 PR's and moving up a spot with a 1.5 AF cut. <font color=yellow>#33 Bob Holden</font> was unlucky enough to lose not one but two places, but he kept his AF backsliding to a minimum with 3 PR's. <font color=yellow>#43 Sebastian Kovats</font> actually managed to gain a position while losing ground in AF, his 7 PR's cutting his losses to roughly half what they could have been. And <font color=yellow>#44 Franco Gubser</font> kept right on Sebastian's tail, moving up 1 spot with him with 5 PR's and closing the gap between them to less than .1 AF.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>This group was where most of the update's activity was concentrated. <font color=yellow>#56 Danny Gallenberger</font> found enough time off from MK7 to put in an appearance. He only PR'ed once, but it was worth a decent amount of damage control. <font color=yellow>#61 Carter Clem</font>, <font color=yellow>#62 Nate Paternost</font>, <font color=yellow>#63 Daniel Crutcher</font>, and <font color=yellow>#64 Dilan Arse</font> all came together in a big block of activity. Carter made the simplest cut, moving ahead 1 place with 6 PR's. Nate and Daniel were the big movers of the bunch, submitting 18 and 17 PR's respectively to leap forward from their original positions of 75th and 74th. Dilan was the unlucky one; he picked up 7 PR's but still lost a place because of Nate and Daniel. <font color=yellow>#68 Christian W</font> felt the effects of their moves as well, PR'ing a dozen times but still losing 2 spots. <font color=yellow>#69 Frederick \"Jackpot\" Hutchington</font> was too busy lining up his cuts to worry about such setbacks. This time, he cut ~4.4 points, roughly ~4% of his AF, with 4 PR's and moved up 4 places. And, incidentally, his MKW points in the Combined Rankings now stand at ~.7777--just as planned, of course. <font color=yellow>#86 Qi Zhu</font> made terrific progress with a whopping 26 PR's, cutting ~16.6 AF and jumping forward 13 places. <font color=yellow>#93 Martin Prigent</font> was one of the players Qi passed, but Martin still managed to move up one place with 2 PR's, despite losing ground in AF. <font color=yellow>#98 Sam Smith's</font> 5 PR's were just enough to cut a bit of AF, but he was left uncomfortably close to the 100 border after being pushed back a spot by Qi. <font color=yellow>#99 Luke Berrill</font> was eager to get away from there as well, and pushed forward one place with 7 PR's, leaving Cyril Fulag on the brink.<br><br><font color=red>~~100+~~</font><br>Activity dropped off sharply outside the Top 100. <font color=yellow>#124 Dexter Howe</font> stayed alive with 1 PR, though he still dropped back in AF along with everyone around him. <font color=green>#171 Stephen L</font> has been quietly playing under the radar for a while now, and finally decided to make the jump onto the AF chart by completing his timesheet. <font color=green>#222 Stan Barmentloo</font> followed suit, finally sitting down to quickly fill out his Flap times. <font color=yellow>#245 Russell Horwood</font> kept active with 13 PR's and got 1 place closer to the Top 200. And finally, <font color=yellow>#297 Andre Riviere</font> returned from a hiatus with 4 PR's, cutting 2 places.<br><br>That's it for the corrected movement section.

        "title": "Autumn Reform",
        "content": "<p><b><font color=red>Update: September 23rd - October 18th</font><br><br>Hello, John Brunn back at the writer's desk once again to bring you this news update. Before I get to the usual report, there are some announcements I have to make. First of all, some disappointing news--our new updater, Sean Owens (aka Malleo), was caught cheating in his Time Trials. He has admitted to using TAS to get some of his PR's, though it seems likely that they aren't the only ones that were illegitimate. Regardless of the exact extent of his dishonesty, he has been stripped of his updating powers and removed from the Players' Page. The good news, however, is that Zack Weber (aka thewebinator) has volunteered to return to news writing. So, for those of you who have been dissatisfied with the quality of recent news updates, you can rest easy; Web and I will be doing them on alternate weeks from now on, and will hopefully help restore the site to its former glory.<br><br>And now, with that out of the way, let's get on with the activity report, shall we?<br><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Things have been fairly quiet since the last update; only 2 newbies showed up in the nearly month-long span.<br><br><font color=lime>Dylan Brown</font> apparently didn't submit any times at all when he joined, so there's no telling where he'd belong on the rankings. Hopefully he'll complete his timesheet soon.<br><font color=lime>Beat Pika</font> just sent in his 9 best times. In theory, they'd be enough for 377th.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>A good 42 players were active while us news writers weren't. Let's take a look at what everyone accomplished, shall we?<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Starting things off, <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font> dropped in with a PR. He didn't cut <i>much</i> AF, but at this level, any progress is reason for celebration. <font color=yellow>#4 Thomas van Deerse</font> netted 4 PR's, creeping a little closer to Marc. <font color=yellow>#5 Ruby Aruba</font> was the busiest karter in the Top 10; he cranked out 11 PR's, and was rewarded by a nearly 1 AF cut--enough to pass Jak Russo. There's a nearly 7 AF gap ahead of him to Thomas, though, so he has a lot more hard work ahead of him to earn his next rank improvement. <font color=yellow>#7 John Brunn</font> was just barely active, mitigating his losses in AF by the smallest amount possible with 1 PR. And down at the end, <font color=yellow>#10 Leo Petiard</font> solidified his position in the group with a quarter point cut to his AF, ending up at 33 points even.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Well, it seems that I wasn't the only one being lazy this past month after all. In this group, no one played! Well, unless you count our delinquent ex-updater, but I don't think TASing counts. ;) I'm sure the stats will be a right old mess once his removal takes effect, but for now, the stats pages still say everyone's 1 place lower, so that's how I'll write the rest of the news.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Things were pretty quiet in this group too, apart from <font color=yellow>#27 Sebastian Kovats</font>, who sent in 14 PR's to leapfrog 15 karters and cut 12.75 AF. The only other active player was <font color=yellow>#40 Franco Gubser</font>, whose efforts on the new Maple Treeway glitch weren't enough to save him from falling back in AF and losing a place to Sebastian.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Activity finally picks up again as we reach the lower half of the Top 100, which was the most active group of the bunch. Close to the 50th-place border, we find <font color=yellow>#54 Danny Gallenberger</font>. He apparently found enough time off from MK7 to play MKWii for a bit, though only long enough to set 1 PR. <font color=yellow>#57 Daniel Crutcher</font> cut nearly 1 point of AF with 4 PR's, and was rewarded by a 1 place cut. <font color=yellow>#58 Dylan Imhoff</font> was also active, but not enough to avoid being displaced by Daniel. <font color=yellow>#60 Frederick Hutchington</font> picked up a PR as well, but, like Danny and Dylan, still fell victim to the infamous AF treadmill. <font color=yellow>#63 Dilan Arse</font> had a bit more luck there; his position didn't change, but he did cut about 1.2 AF with 2 PR's. He was only the first of a string of players who all felt like PR'ing exactly twice; <font color=yellow>#81 Qi Zhu</font> also came up with 2 PR's, but he still fell back a bit in AF. However, he did slow his descent enough to pass 1 other player, so it wasn't a total loss for him. AF neighbors <font color=yellow>#88 Viktor Silivanov</font> and <font color=yellow>#89 Luke Berrill</font> both managed to cut a bit of AF with their PR pairs, though their ranks didn't change. <font color=yellow>#92 Loris Bagnasco</font> only slightly mitigated his AF losses, but he was still better off than the players around him. <font color=yellow>#97 Sam Smith</font> marks the end of the 2-PR streak, as he went one better than the players ahead of him. He got a solid ~1.8 AF cut and 1 place improvement for his trouble. And it's just as well that he did, because <font color=yellow>#99 Blake Germany</font> came vaulting straight into the Top 100 all the way from 137th, and probably still has some momentum to spare. Blake apparently found some spare time left over from being the DKSC king, as he made quite a bit of progress toward balancing his timesheet. He improved a whopping 31 of his times, cutting over 50(!) AF--the biggest cut of the update by far.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Meanwhile, someone who's probably not too happy with Blake right now is <font color=yellow>#101 Evan Simmons</font>. His 5 PR's and ~3 point AF cut would have been enough to see him into the Top 100, but since Blake beat him in, he got left out in the cold. #100 Cyril Fulag is now about 2 points away, so Evan will have to keep up his progress if he wants to make it in. Lower down, <font color=yellow>#163 Stephen L</font> kept busy with 2 PR's. He moved up 1 spot by cutting just over 1 AF, and is now just 1 place below that guy you'll be hearing from next week, Zack Weber. <font color=green>#166 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> is new to the full AF rankings; after working for some time to fill out his timesheet, he finally completed it and joined at a respectable rank in the Hero C range. And last but not least in this update is <font color=yellow>#167 Rob Jon</font>. He updated 21 of his times for a ~15 point AF cut, jumping ahead 16 places in the rankings.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Four Site Records have been improved since the last update, two of which have changed hands. The two that didn't belong to Blake Germany, who still rules DK Summit with an iron fist. Carter Clem picked up his first SR, dropping Steve Bernelli's total to 2, while Dylan Imhoff took Ruby Aruba's only SR to gain total domination of GBA Bowser Castle 3.<br><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>improved his own <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross crs</font> time of 1'48\"713 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'47\"987</font><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>also improved his own <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font> time of 0'35\"022 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'34\"543</font><br><font color=yellow>Carter Clem </font>beat Steve Bernelli's <font color=orange>Maple Treeway lap</font> time of 0'27\"694 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'27\"489</font><br><font color=yellow>Dylan Imhoff </font>beat Ruby Aruba's old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 lap</font> time of 0'38\"085 and got the first 38 second sub with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'37\"991</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>Still working on filling these out...Please be patient.<br><br><br>That'll do it for this update.

Can’t wait for all of the typo corrections again! Let’s get to the news.<br><br><font color=red>This news update covers October 19th to October 25, 2012.</font><br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Three new players decided to join the ranks of the MKWPP faithful this week.<br><font color=lime>Benjamin Lane</font> submitted 19 times (all courses, shocker) to start out his MKW career. He’s started to grasp some of the glitches and with practice I’m sure his times will start to drop. Theoretically he’s 415th now, but he can only climb from there.   <br><font color=lime>Alex B</font> mysteriously left his last name blank as he sent in 13 times to place him in the 377th position if the rest of his times were dead last. It’s a good start, and with a near 1:10 LC sub already, he looks to be set for a nice climb upwards on the charts. <br><font color=lime>Thomas Gonda</font> sent in one time, a low 1:01 on rYF. Though it took him three hours, hopefully as his MKW career goes on he won’t have to take as long to lower it.    <br><br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>29 players were active this week.<br><br>I felt like bringing my  “Welcome to the AF chart” segment back because it’s always nice when you finally get noticed on the movement section week to week, but sadly nobody joined. With our three new players not having a full timesheet and everyone else “down there” not wanting to leave, I guess we’ll have to wait a few weeks. Let’s get on to the actual movement. <br><br><font color=red>~~The Top 10~~</font><br>Even with all of the shakeups in the last months, the Top 10 still has players that are intent on improving their ranks. <font color=yellow>#4 Thomas van Deerse</font> knocked out two PRs on TF to knock off .2% off his AF score. He’s getting pretty close to <font color=yellow>#3 Marc Bas</font> now, so maybe we’ll see that pass soon. The other active player in the pinnacle of MKW TTs was <font color=yellow>#10 Leo Petiard</font>, who had 7 PRs to his name and took off .8 AF points from his score. Among them was a set of MT glitch times that have been helping everyone still active claim some AF points off of the inactive players. He’s only a tenth off of <font color=yellow>#9 Aziz Abdullah</font>  to further secure a spot in the Top 10, so hopefully Leo keeps making these types of improvements. <br><br><font color=red>~~11-25: Past Champs and Inactives~~</font><br>Three players turned on their Wiis to take down a combined 8 PRs this week. First up was <font color=yellow>#16 Alex Shoal</font>, still managing to PR even after all of his past high-level activity. He hit a low 1:51 on DKSC, perhaps trying to keep up with recent WR activity on the track. Next was the standout of the group <font color=yellow>#23 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font>, who had a nice four point AF cut with 6 PRs. Sadly even with that impressive showing he couldn’t gain any places on the charts. The good news is he’s almost cleared the entirety of the 6.5 AF graveyard that he had to traverse across. One more week like that and Fabien Jacques and Alvin Le await in the 46 AF range. Finally <font color=yellow>#25 Liam Ashcroft</font> sent in one time to cut .2 AF, a 59.913 on rYF. One of those subs that I’m sure feels really good, but I’ve never experienced. :( He’s only .2 AF points away from <font color=yellow>#24 Jamie Disley</font>, so pushing for a few more PRs should secure his spot in this group <br><br><font color=red>~~26-50:The Future of MKW?~~</font><br>Yeah, no one decided to submit PRs here, from <font color=yellow>#26 Sebastian Kovats</font> to <font color=yellow>#50 Alberto Fiorese</font>. I guess that’s good news for anyone right below them, you might want to sneak in and grab a bunch of positions while they still slumber.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100:Seizing Oppurtunities~~</font><br>Starting off this list is <font color=yellow>#56 Daniel Crutcher</font> with 4 PRs and a 2.5 AF cut. All of the PRs were course times, and he’s begun to experiment with the Spear on rSGB. There’s nobody ahead of you Daniel, so go grab some spots. Next is <font color=yellow>#64 Christian W</font>, who apparently has no relation to the combined kart champion in the same country, had a nice distinction this week. He was the highest ranked karter to actually pass someone on the charts, moving from #65 to #64 with 8 PRs and a 2.4 AF cut and knocking down Inviso a spot. The next few players are spread out ahead of him but with PR streaks like that he should catch them soon. <font color=yellow>#79 Luke Berrill</font> had 12 PRs that brought him from #88 to #79 and cut 10 AF points. So much for nobody passing anyone. That 8% cut was the best of the week and a massive group of 5 players with 110 AF await him only 4 AF points away. <font color=yellow>#81 Qi Zhu</font> was a victim of this move, he PRed once but managed to only break even exactly, not gaining or losing any AF. Hopefully he’ll cut a little more than TF, which he appears to have been doing religiously lately, and he’ll be able to make AF cuts and position improvements. Last active here was <font color=yellow>#83 Jon Coppernoll</font>, who made two “improvements” that couldn’t really be called PRs because even though they cut 1.2 AF, he pathetically couldn’t move up any places. Normally I’d feel bad, but due to some activity on the combined charts recently I just can’t bring myself to tears over it. Too bad Jon, work harder next week.<br><br><font color=red>~~The Rest: Targeting Me for Some Reason~~</font><br>Two players were active down here, both less than five places behind me on the AF charts. <font color=yellow>#162 Stephen L</font>, had one PR that knocked off .93 AF points from his score. He’s only about 1.2 points away from my position, so I’ll probably be knocked down more next week. Good luck, I guess. Finally, <font color=yellow>#165 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font>  had one PR of his own, cutting .08 AF points and getting him marginally closer to Michael Miller and 164th. Keep playing and PRing, because nobody down here ever does. You’ll move up in time, good luck!<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Only one site record was broken this week, by Paul-Philipp Baehr on newly glitched MT flap. He knocked Carter Clem’s time down half of a second and knocked Clem off of the Site Records table. Meanwhile, Baehr moved up to a tie for fourth with 2 SRs, adding MT to his already claimed WGM flap.<br><br><font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> beat Carter Clem’s old <font color=orange>Maple Treeway lap</font> time of 0’27”489 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0’26”945</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>I’m going to wait to start awarding these until everything is figured out with MrL1193, so stay tuned in the coming weeks for the catching up of awards once more.<br><br>There it is, my return to news updating. Feel free to put praise/criticism on the forums, and especially all of my typos, I love those. Keep karting everyone!<br>~Web</p>",

They're only good enough for approximately 421st place on their own, so hopefully Amy will follow them up with the other 60 times soon.<br><br><font color=orange>Movement</font><br>With Halloween providing a distraction, not many players were active this week--only 20 in all.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>As we shine our flashlight into the darkness in search of the mythical Active Karters, the first (and only one in the Top 10) to step into the spotlight is <font color=yellow>#3 Thomas van Deerse</font>. With just a few points to go to reach Champion Shaun Tanney, it seems Thomas has taken an interest in improving his glitch times for some quick AF cuts. He turned his attention to Grumble Volcano first and was rewarded with 2 PR's and nearly a full point cut from his AF, enough to pass French Champion Marc Bas. He's still separated from Nick and Shaun by a significant margin, though, so he may soon have to think up other AF-cutting tactics to reach his goal.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-50~~</font><br>Hardly anyone did anything in this section, which would normally be separated into two groups. Thus, <font color=yellow>#26 Sebastian Kovats</font> gets the attention all to himself. He only cut a very small amount of AF, but he did manage to achieve the prestigious 1:50 sub on Dry Dry Ruins, so he can still take pride in that accomplishment.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>The lower half of the Top 100 accounted for more than half of this update's active players. <font color=yellow>#53 Daniel Crutcher</font> managed to leapfrog 3 karters with 3 PR's, landing just in front of <font color=yellow>#54 Danny Gallenberger</font>. Dan G was probably none too pleased about losing a place to Dan C's antics, but he did at least cut a bit of AF by updating an old DK Summit PR. The two Dans weren't the only ones playing in pairs, as <font color=yellow>#81 Qi Zhu</font> and <font color=yellow>#82 Jon Coppernoll</font> were also busy. Kezer cut a bit of AF by working on GCN Mario Circuit and continuing to improve his Toad's Factory times, while Jon played DK Summit, earning a bigger cut of ~1.9 AF and passing Yannick Wiesner.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>And finally, our search for things that go bump in the night wraps up with <font color=yellow>#159 Rob Jon</font>, who, like Thomas and Sebastian, was the only player active out in his vast graveyard of a group. With updates to 8 times to report, he cut over 10 points of AF and jumped forward 7 places in the rankings.<br><br><br><font color=orange>Site Records</font><br>Surprisingly, not one Site Record was improved this week. I'm pretty sure this is just the result of infrequent submissions from certain players, though, so there will probably be a couple new SR's to report by next week.<br><br><br><font color=orange>Awards</font><br>4th POW of October: <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font> - After persistent effort to continue his progress at the top, Thomas was finally rewarded with the #3 spot this week. He cut exactly 1 point of AF--no mean feat at this level--which was just enough to pass Marc Bas.<br><br>Sorry I didn't get around to catching up more on the awards; I'll try to fill in more of them in coming weeks, after which we'll hopefully be able to resume a regular awards schedule.

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, Web here for another batch of news. Hope everyone had fun during Halloween and is looking forward to Thanksgiving! Were you were confused what do do on Maple Treeway and Peach Beach, and what was allowed as a non-glitch time?  Well we’ve added them to the “No Glitch Rules” section of the site, amongst all of the other glitches. Thanks to Frederick Hutchington and Dexter Howe, as well as MrL1193 for all of that work. Let’s get on to the week’s events.<br><br>This news update covers November 2nd to 8th, 2012.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Nobody new joined this week, rendering this section useless. What a shame.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>26 players were active this week, with no one joining the AF charts from the Land of Unfinished Timesheets. <br><br><font color=red>~~The Top 10~~</font><br>The Top 10 has continued to improve week to week even after all of this time, with three players coming in this week to submit PRs. Recently crowned <font color=yellow>#3 Thomas van Deerse</font> continued his improvement, registering a high 2:12.7 on Bowser’s Castle and knocking off .0312 AF points. The gap between his position and #2 Nick Meade is slightly less than 3 AF now, so it’s going to be tough work to narrow the gap at this level. <font color=yellow>#7 John Brunn</font> was next up, sending in one PR. Sadly, it wasn’t enough due to other players passing him, and he still lost a bit of AF. Closing the gap week-to-week is <font color=yellow>#9 Leo Petiard</font>, who had 3 PRs this week. He slashed almost half of an AF point, to nearly jump the entire gap to 8th place. He’s only .7 points off of Dave Tandy and then another half a point to my fellow newswriter now. A shakeup near the bottom of the Top 10 seems to be approaching. <br><br><font color=red>~~11-25 ~~</font><br>The next group down also had three players competing, however this time positions were gained and lost on the charts. <font color=yellow>#14 Alex Shoal</font> had 4 PRs, including times on Toad’s Factory and some nice improvements on MC glitch. He jumped up two positions this week with a 1.5 AF cut, and now sits one AF point away from 13th place. Right below him is <font color=yellow>#15 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, one of the victims of Alex’s nice week. Salvatore managed 4 PRs of his own but only cut two tenths of AF, ultimately losing to Alex’s charge. Meanwhile, ex-site champ Bubbles dropped a spot in his retirement, down to a still-impressive 16th after long inactivity. The final member of this group PRing was <font color=yellow>#23 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font>, who sent in 1 PR to cut .2 AF points. The 1:51.8 on TF cleared a little bit of the long 5 AF graveyard he’s been trudging through for the past few weeks. <br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Again, no one submitted here, but due to the activity occurring below, this sad section of the news might have more than meaningless filler in a few weeks.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Here’s where the real activity of this week began.  <font color=yellow>#53 Daniel Crutcher</font> led out the group with 2 PRs and a small AF cut. He’s closing the gap very slowly on Gary Marcoz and is only 3 AF points out of the Top 50. Luckily he won’t have much to contend with once he gets to that dead zone. Watching behind him may be a problem however, since <font color=yellow>#54 Danny Gallenberger</font> sent in a RR 3lap to cut .15 AF points and bring himself only three tenths away from catching Daniel. The two now can fight against each other and the inactive zombies as they race up the charts.   <font color=yellow>#64 Christian W</font> had a .15 AF cut with 3 PRs, chipping away slightly at the players in front of him. Next up was all-around MK standout <font color=yellow>#74 Stacy Needham</font>, who had a 1:54 on DKSC that cut off a tenth of AF. <font color=yellow>#79 Luke Berrill</font> had one impressive PR on rWS that accounted for a 1.5 AF cut. He couldn’t pass any players but still managed to close the gap between himself and Chaos. Closing out the group was <font color=yellow>#80 Jon Coppernoll</font>, who redeemed himself from an atrocious showing two weeks ago and sent in two PRs to cut 1.7 AF points and pass two players, the best jump of the week.  Luke is about three points away through so he’ll need two more weeks like that to attempt another pass.<br><br><font color=red>~~Everyone Else~~</font><br>Two players sent in times here, starting with <font color=yellow>#122 Dexter Howe</font>. Sending in one PR, he cut .4 AF and jumped past Lars Riecken to secure another spot on the rankings. Finally, <font color=yellow>#163 Stephen L</font> submitted one time, cutting .6 AF points and drawing ever closer to knocking me down another spot on the rankings. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Two site records were conquered this week, both on the always-active glitchy Maple Treeway. Steve Bernelli improved his own course time while snatching the flap. Due to this, there wasn’t much movement on the Site Record Movement Table. Steve Bernelli moved up to a tie for 3rd with Toad Norton with his 3 SRs, while Paul-Philipp fell down to a tie for 17th, with all of the other one SR players. It seems track specialists still reign supreme even years after MKW’s release.<br><br><font color=yellow>Steve Bernelli </font>beat his own  <font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time of 2'02\"706 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'02\"417</font><br><font color=yellow>Steve Bernelli </font>beat Paul-Philipp Baehr’s old <font color=orange>Maple Treeway lap</font> time of 0'26\"945 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'26\"700</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>These will happen soon, just making sure everything is caught up first. In the meantime just keep karting so you’ll be awarded one once everything is ready once more.<br><br>Well, that’s it for this week. Thanks for reading and keep karting everyone!<br>~Web</p>",

        "content": "<p><b><font color=red>Update: November 8th - November 15th</font><br><br>Hey guys, John here, ready to deliver your weekly news. The big story this week is that a new strategy was discovered for Coconut Mall's already-glitchy fast lap; it involves jumping up on the edge of the grass in the parking lot to trip the finish line checkpoint in a better location and then circling around to complete the lap in under 5 seconds. Naturally, a flurry of activity ensued, with players of various ranks all eager to try it out. Let's take a closer look at how everyone fared, shall we?<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>The only rookie to join this week was <font color=lime>Steven Reinhold</font>. He got off to a solid start, earning a theoretical rank of 251st with 40 PR's, and seems motivated to improve from there. Hopefully he'll also fill in the rest of his lap times as he progresses.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>A fairly average 28 players sent in new times this week, though none of them were players completing their timesheets to join the rankings.<br><br><font color=red>~~The Top 10~~</font><br>For the most part, the foremost MKW players seem to remain constant in their activity or inactivity. Current champ Shaun Tanney and former longtime champ Nick Meade, for instance, usually slumber on, oblivious of the players below them. This, of course, provides opportunities for constantly active players like <font color=yellow>#3 Thomas van Deerse</font> to creep up through the rankings. Thomas has been busy improving his Moo Moo Meadows course time lately, which earned him a small AF cut this week. <font color=yellow>#7 John Brunn</font> has been focusing on a single course as well--N64 Bowser's Castle, in his case--but since he didn't improve his rank as much as Thomas did, he still suffered a loss in AF. As such, he's in <font color=yellow>#8 Leo Petiard</font>'s crosshairs now. Leo improved both his course and lap times on Coconut Mall, making a significant cut in AF. He passed Dave Tandy, and seems ready to press on to catch John.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Last week, <font color=yellow>#14 Alex Shoal</font> and <font color=yellow>#15 Salvatore Bellusci</font> were both active, each submitting 4 PR's. This week, they repeated their previous week's performance, making solid AF cuts. This time, it was Salvatore who got the bigger cut, though it wasn't enough to trade places with Alex. Unlike last week, #23 Paul-Philipp Baehr didn't put in an appearance, but <font color=yellow>#24 Liam Ashcroft</font> did. He submitted improvements to several of his flaps, earning a nice ~2.4 AF cut, and is now a mere ~.6 AF away from subbing 50 points. Unfortunately, his rank didn't change because he's currently caught in an AF dead zone, but the going should get easier if he can catch up with Paul.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>As is often the case lately, this section was quite quiet. <font color=yellow>#34 Marvin Donjes</font> popped in out of MK7 land to try out the new Coconut Mall flap strategy, keeping his AF backsliding to a minimum by staying ahead of others who attempted it. And just now joining the group is <font color=yellow>#50 Daniel Crutcher</font>, who somehow found time to both defend his Coconut Mall flap record and improve other times for a grand total of 7 PR's. He cut ~3.3 AF, passed 3 players, and pulled his AF under the 80 point mark--not a bad for just one week's work.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Meanwhile, fellow Dan <font color=yellow>#54 Danny Gallenberger</font> was busy as well this week. In addition to the obligatory Coconut Mall flap improvement, he also submitted several improvements to both his Rainbow Road times during the week, cutting ~.9 AF. <font color=yellow>#64 Christian W</font> bucked the trend of the week by getting a 2:33.4 on N64 Bowser's Castle instead. It ended up cutting almost half a point from his AF total, so it must have been a pretty solid improvement over his previous time. And our last active player in the Top 100, <font color=yellow>#74 Luke Berrill</font> didn't bother with Coconut Mall either, instead submitting 3 PR's on various other courses. He cut ~2.6 AF and leaped forward 5 spots in the rankings just so this section could be all about people whose ranks end in the number 4.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#118 Dexter Howe</font> leads the post-100 activity section, as he often does. As expected, he gave the Coconut Mall flap strategy a try, but he also managed to finish his first Maple Treeway glitched run, though he was extremely dissatisfied with it. His AF cut was nothing to sneeze at, however, at nearly 4 points, and he also rose 4 places--an average of 2 places with each PR. I'm sure many players wish they could say the same about their week's PR's. <font color=yellow>#154 Rob Jon</font> didn't do too badly himself, though, improving by 5 places and almost 8 AF with just 6 PR's. <font color=yellow>#166 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> wasn't quite so lucky, as he didn't move up, but he did cut a bit of AF with his 2 PR's, which is much better than free falling like the players around him. And wrapping up this week's activity is <font color=yellow>#346 Stephen de Winter</font>, who also submitted 2 PR's. He cut ~5.2 AF, shooting past 7 of the closely packed karters in the road ahead of him.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>As expected, the scene of most of this week's Site Record activity was Coconut Mall's parking lot of ethereal cars and curbs. Many players were scrambling to seize the now-vulnerable SR, but when the dust settled, it was instead the Mario Circuit course record that had a new owner. Michael Penninck claimed his first SR there, pulling Tony Ros down to join him among the 29 players tied for 16th with 1 SR each.<br><br><font color=yellow>Michael Penninck </font>beat Tony Ros's old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'04\"984 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'04\"461</font><br><font color=yellow>Daniel Crutcher </font>fought off all challengers to retain his <font color=orange>Coconut Mall lap</font> record. From his old time of 0'05\"607, he made numerous improvements, ending the week with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04\"351</font> It is now the lowest lap time on the site, just barely beating out Grumble Volcano's.<br><font color=yellow>Steve Bernelli </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Maple Treeway lap</font> time of 0'26\"700 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'26\"406</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>1st POW of November: <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font> - Not content to stop at earning the bronze medal, Thomas continued to press on. He earned 5 PR's this week, cutting more than a full point of AF--a rarity at such a high level.<br>2nd POW of November: <font color=yellow>Liam Ashcroft</font> - Liam was the only player to exceed a 4% cut in AF this week. 5 solid PR's knocked ~2.36 points off his AF.<br><br>I still haven't finished catching up on the old awards that certain cheaters rendered invalid, but that doesn't mean we have to let newer awards pile up as well. We'll do our best to make sure you keep getting the awards you deserve every week. Remember, these aren't just for a select few players to monopolize--if you keep making strides every week, you're bound to get noticed sooner or later. So keep on karting!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>What’s up everyone, it’s time for another round of MKW news. If you haven’t checked out the MKW forums recently, Alex Shoal has been running a GOAT of GOATs competition to see who is the community’s pick for the greatest player ever, and it’s getting down to the final rounds. You should go check it out if you haven’t already. Let’s get on to the week’s news.<br><br><font color=red>This news update covers November 16nd  to 22nd, 2012. </font><br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>No newbies this week.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>22 players karted this week, and no one finished up their timesheet from the Land of Unfinished Timesheets. <br><br><font color=red>~~The Top 10~~</font><br>The Top 10 seems to keep the same players active week to week. I may sound like a broken record here, but again <font color=yellow>#3 Thomas van Deerse</font> kept up his PRing pace, setting three times this week, including PRs on DKJP and rSGB. He cut just over half an AF point and is getting ever closer to snatching the second spot on the rankings from Meade. It’s less than 2 AF points now, and if things continue the way they have been, it shouldn’t be long before Thomas claims it. Finally, John Brunn submitted a PR, but it wasn’t enough for him to overcome the AF treadmill. The good news is Leo Petiard didn’t submit, so John could squeeze out the gap a little from Leo’s charging pace.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25 ~~</font><br>The next group had two players active, starting with <font color=yellow>#13 Salvatore Bellusci</font> He had an impressive week, with 5 PRs and a 2% AF cut. His move allowed him to pass both Lee Duggan and Alex Shoal. Ahead stands the top 10 barrier, a mere 3.4 AF points away. <font color=yellow>#24 Liam Ashcroft</font> was the last active in this group, sending in 4 times for a 1.2 point AF cut. He’s pulling away from 25th and getting pretty close to the next slew of players in the 47-48 AF range.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#48 Daniel Crutcher</font> breaks into this group with style, saving it from inactivity and leaving a lot of inactive players in front of Daniel for him to pass. This week brought 7 PRs for an almost two point AF cut. MKW Legend Brendan Payne sits in front of Daniel as his next victim, maybe we’ll see that pass next week.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Three players were active in this section, starting off with Here’s where the real activity of this week began.  <font color=yellow>#64 Christian W</font>. Christian W only had 1 PR to submit, knocking off a tenth of a point from his score. Further down a battle is emerging between . <font color=yellow>#80 Jon Coppernoll</font> and . <font color=yellow>#81 Qi Zhu</font>. Jon had the greater week, with 2 PRs and a whole AF point lost from his old score, but Qi still submitted a PR, unwilling to let Jon go so easily. Jon does have the edge here, with a point and a half of space, so maybe Chaos is a better target for him at 79th.  <br><br><font color=red>~~101-Obscurity~~</font><br>Two players sent in times here, with <font color=yellow>#146 Rob Jon</font> submitting 19 PRs for an 8.1 point AF cut. With that ridiculous week he moves from 154th up 8 spots, and 5 more players await in the next three AF points. Finally, last active for the week was <font color=yellow>#246 Josh Miller</font>, who had a 3 PR submission for a 2.25 point AF cut. He managed to pass one player on the charts too, which I’m sure gives him a little motivation boost. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Two site records were conquered this week. Daniel Crutcher took down his own Coconut Mall flap while Salvatore Bellusci snatched the Rainbow Road flap record from Marvin Donjes. This doesn’t move much around on the table, but it does bump up Salvatore to a tie for 5th with 2 SRs, and take Marvin Donjes off of the list entirely.<br><font color=yellow>Daniel Crutcher </font>beat his own old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall lap</font> time of0'04\"351 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04\"335</font><br><font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci </font>beat Marvin Donjes’s old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> time of0'48\"092 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'48\"068</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>In a week with little activity, recognition can be given to <font color=yellow>Daniel Crutcher</font>, who earns the 3rd POW of November.

        "content": "<p><b><font color=red>Update: November 22nd - December 1st</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>No one new stepped into the ring this week.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>A modest 24 players made time for karting this week. A number of them were ones with incomplete timesheets, as is often the case, but none of them managed to finish filling in the rest of their times, unfortunately.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>As usual, <font color=yellow>#3 Thomas van Deerse</font> leads the charge this week. With 5 new PR's, he cut almost a full point of AF, almost halving the gap to #2 Nick Meade. And down at the lower end of the group, <font color=yellow>#8 Leo Petiard</font> also submitted 5 new times, though he only cut a small amount of AF. The dynamic duo seem to have a monopoly on Top 10 activity at the moment, so expect to see them continue on to even greater heights.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#12 Salvatore Bellusci</font> looks like he could be joining Thomas and Leo before long. With 3 PR's, he cut enough AF to pass Mark Schmidt and take his title of German Champion. <font color=yellow>#15 Alex Shoal</font> barely cut any AF, but he did make a nice improvement to his GCN Mario Circuit time. And <font color=yellow>#21 Liam Ashcroft</font> sent in 7 new times, cutting over 3 AF and leapfrogging 3 players.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Not much happened in the rest of the groups this week. <font color=yellow>#47 Daniel Crutcher</font> passed famed MKW player Brendan Payne with 5 PR's, but not a creature was stirring throughout the rest of the Top 50.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Next up, it's <font color=yellow>#64 Christian W</font>'s turn to get a section all to himself. He only improved one time--which, coincidentally, was N64 Bowser's Castle lap--not quite succeeding in cutting AF, but at least mitigating his losses.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>And finally, not too far out in No Man's Land, <font color=yellow>#132 Rob Jon</font> and <font color=yellow>#140 James Leare</font> made some nice cuts with large numbers of PR's. James earned a solid 9, cutting ~5.7 AF and passing 3 players, but his improvement paled in comparison to Rob's, who jumped forward 14 places with the same number of PR's, cutting almost 22 points of AF. Rob's accomplishment was made even more impressive by the fact that he apparently didn't hoard any of his times, meaning he must have really been playing hard all week. Great job, Rob; keep up this pace and you'll make the Top 100 in no time!<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>The Site Records front was quite quiet this week, with no transfers of titles going on and only one record being improved at all.<br><br><font color=yellow>Steve Bernelli </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Maple Treeway lap</font> time of 0'26\"406 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'25\"975</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>4th POW of November: <font color=yellow>Rob Jon</font> - Rob made an incredible amount of progress for just one week's time, PR'ing 14 times and moving from 146th to 132nd. He slashed almost 22 points, or ~11.1%, from his total AF, much more than anyone in the Top 100.<br>November POM: <font color=yellow>Rob Jon</font> - Constantly active throughout the month, Rob accumulated a terrific AF cut of ~38.9 points, approximately 18.1% of his total. He raced ahead 27 places, from #159 to #132, and improved 33 of his times along the way.<br><br>It's not often that a player can win awards while still ranked outside the Top 100, but Rob did--and if he did, then so can you! So what are you waiting for? Get out there and start karting; with enough effort, anyone can be honored here. Happy karting!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hey guys, Web here for another edition of your weekly MKW news. We’re looking for a few times updaters to help keep the site updated, so if you’re interested, apply in the forums! <br><br><font color=red>This news update covers December 2nd to 8th, 2012. </font><br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>Nobody new joined this week, but my investigatory skills tell me next week that someone may be joining the site. Stay tuned!<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Only 19 players picked up their controllers this week, a smaller number than usual (may be attributed to me forgetting to update a few days before today, sorry about that). For once, the second half of this paragraph has meaning. From the weathered and tortured Land of the Unfinished Timesheets, <font color=yellow>#164 Steven Reinhold</font> burst into the scene. He finished up his timesheet with 8 new submissions. 164th is a very respectable spot to join in on the charts, and with the lack of activity above it shouldn’t be hard to push further upwards.<br><br><font color=red>~~The Top 10~~</font><br>Big news in the Top 10 this week. <font color=yellow>#2 Thomas van Deerse</font> submitted 5 PRs including GV2 and DDR improvements to jump ex-champion Nick Meade and pass for the vice crown position on the charts. Champion Tanney has slept for a long time, and now “only” 79 position improvements separate Thomas from capturing it for himself. Those positions are hard to come by, but they can only seem sweeter  as each brings him closer to the title. Also active as always was <font color=yellow>#7 John Brunn</font>, who had one PR that cut his AF score by two tenths. He’s in a bit of a gap right now, but Leo Petiard has been active recently so any improvements can help hold his ground.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25 ~~</font><br>Two players picked up their controllers in the 11-25 zone this week. <font color=yellow>#12 Salvatore Bellusci</font> karted his way to a 1:52.180 on Toad’s Factory, cutting .15 AF off of his total and moving closer to the Top 10. Tony Ros is only two tenths away, but after that a 2 point chasm awaits. The only way to power through is constant activity, so good luck! Next up was <font color=yellow>#21 Liam Ashcroft</font>, who had a PR of his own, a nice near-29 second sub on rMC flap. It kept him above the red and pushed him closer to the Top 20, though a 1.5 point gap is still sitting in front of him.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Two is the magic number this week, with another two karters being active in this group. <font color=yellow>#26 Sebastian Kovats</font> had an impressive 5 PRs to cut 1.3 AF points. The gaps are crazy at this level, so it didn’t net him any place improvements, but he’s only .7 away from making this paragraph 50% less active. Finally, <font color=yellow>#46 Daniel Crutcher</font> has been tearing up the charts recently, this time sending a solid RR flap and a near rDKJP sub that would make any karter shed a tear; 2:16.001. On the positive side, he did pass Marvin Rekovsky and Daniel Anderson isn’t far ahead.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Only one player, <font color=yellow>#64 Christian W</font> was active here, breaking the trend but not really surprising anyone in this section of ex-karters and lost PRs. Christian sent in 2 PRs to cut .4 points of AF and almost catching Nate Paternost to move up another spot in the rankings. It can’t be that hard when nobody around him is playing though.<br><br><font color=red>~~101-Obscurity~~</font><br>To close out the small activity for the week, POM winner <font color=yellow>#119 Rob Jon</font> had a monster week. He sent in 13 PRs for an 11 point AF cut and an improvement from 132nd position up almost 15 spots. The Top 100 seems in reach at this point with the progress he’s making, and it’s making up for the total lack of activity in the rest of the section. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>No records changed hands, but three were broken by their old holders. Daniel Crutcher pushed down his CM flap almost half of a tenth, and Blake Germany knocked down both of the DKSC records to try and solidify his hold on the title. Being that no records changed hands, the records table stayed motionless for a week.<br><font color=yellow>Daniel Crutcher </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall lap</font> time of0'04\"335 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04\"289</font><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross crs</font> time of 1'47\"987 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'47\"533</font><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font> time of 0'34\"543 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'34\"518</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>The first week of the holiday month goes to someone who has been earning his workload over the past few weeks. <font color=yellow>Rob Jon</font>, wins the 1st POW of December for a ridiculous week of 13 PRs for an 11.6 point AF cut and a 13 spot improvement in the rankings. <br><br>That’s the news for this week.

I apologize for the delay; rest assured, however, that I didn't forget you. So straightaway, let's get to giving credit where it's due.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>After a dry spell of a few weeks, the site finally saw a couple more newbies decide to take the plunge and join up. This may herald coming holiday activity, and I expect that more will join by next week.<br><br><font color=lime>Nathan Chintagavongse</font> (boy I'm glad I don't have to say that out loud) was first up this week. He sent in 32 times...guess which ones? It was a fairly solid set overall, though, highlighted by a 1:51.6 on Toad's Factory. With them, he's guaranteed to at least be better than 265th should he ever send in his lap times.<br><font color=lime>Sora Hoshi</font> only sent in 8 course times, saying he hadn't done the other courses yet. He seemed to have an affinity for Coconut Mall NonSC, his 1:58.6 hinting that he probably could do much better than the 393rd place his current times rank him at.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>In all, 26 players were active this week, though it seems that not many of them had full timesheets. And, for that matter, no one who had a partial timesheet completed it, so there's no one for me to congratulate here either. Oh well.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>For once, #2 Thomas van Deerse apparently took a week off, leaving <font color=yellow>#5 Ruby Aruba</font> to kick off this section. Aruba returned after a lengthy break with PR's on GCN Waluigi Stadium and N64 Bowser's Castle; he still took a net loss in AF, but only the smallest amount possible. <font color=yellow>#7 John Brunn</font>'s AF was also fairly static this week, as he cut the <i>second</i>-smallest amount possible; he only got 1 PR, on DS Delfino Square, but it was enough to hold his ground.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>The next group didn't show many signs of progress either, despite some degree of activity. <font color=yellow>#12 Salvatore Bellusci</font> played non-glitch retro DK tracks and came up with 2 PR's, thus taking only the <i>third</i>-smallest net loss possible in AF. And <font color=yellow>#21 Liam Ashcroft</font>'s lone PR barely did anything to mitigate his AF loss at all, but considering the fact that it was a new SR (mentioned below), he probably isn't complaining.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#45 Daniel Crutcher</font> was busy as usual, this week directing his attention to Bowser's Castle and GBA Bowser Castle 3. Those 2 PR's earned him a ~0.6 AF cut, which was good enough for him to pass retired Sherbet Land great Daniel Anderson and claim this paragraph for himself.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#62 Christian W</font> also gets his own paragraph this update--for the third week in a row, in fact. He blitzed past Nate Paternost and Dilan Arse with no fewer than 8 PR's, cutting around 2.3 AF. The rest of the Top 100 merely slept the week away, as usual.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>The active players in the post-100 field were surprisingly few and far between this week--no two of them were in the same 100's range, in fact. As a result, <font color=yellow>#160 Steven Reinhold</font>, who completed his timesheet only last week, took center stage this week, helped by an absurd number of PR's--14 in all. With them, he cut ~6.4 AF and shot past 4 players, including my fellow news writer Zack Weber. Down in the 200's, <font color=yellow>#245 Josh Miller</font> cut almost one and a half points of AF with 4 PR's, moving up 2 spots. And finally, <font color=yellow>#360 Christophe Charignon</font> sent in 3 PR's, possibly looking for some Combined Rankings points. He improved 3 places, an average of 1 place per PR, and has a nice cluster of 5 karters ahead of him to look forward to passing should he continue to play.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>There was a healthy amount of SR activity this week, with four being improved, three of them finding new owners. The most significant change to the rankings resulted from Liam Ashcroft smashing one of Romain Smadja's old flap records, dropping him to 3 SR's and out of his tie with Lee Duggan for most SR's and leaving him in a 3-way tie for second. Liam himself joined the horde of one-record wonders tied for 17th, as did Nafumo Chan, who seized Andrew Grieve's last remaining SR. And finally, Luis G knocked Alvin van Asselt back down into the aforementioned horde by claming one of Alvin's Daisy Circuit records for his own. With it, Luis rose to tied 5th at 2 SR's.<br><br><font color=yellow>Nafumo Chan </font>beat Andrew Grieve's old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'50\"897 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'50\"864</font><br><font color=yellow>Luis G </font>beat Alvin van Asselt's <font color=orange>Daisy Circuit crs</font> time of 1'29\"518 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'29\"428</font><br><font color=yellow>Axel San </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'10\"917 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'10\"532</font><br><font color=yellow>Liam Ashcroft </font>beat Romain Smadja's old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills lap</font> time of 0'29\"568 by over a tenth with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'29\"432</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>2nd POW of December: <font color=yellow>Christian W</font> - A slow week in the Top 100 gave ever-active Christian a chance to shine. With an impressive 8 PR's, he cut ~2.3 points, or ~2.4% of his total AF, and improved from 64th to 62nd.<br><br>That'll do it for this update.

        "content": "<p><b>Hello? If anyone out there still has an internet connection and is safe, somehow untouched by the devastating events that happened a mere nine days ago, I’m speaking to you. When I took this job back I knew it would take dedication, so I’m writing the news, despite the apocalyptic dystopian society that now lies before us. Here’s the last week of news I may ever be able to deliver.<br><br><font color=red>This news update covers December 16nd to 29th, 2012. </font><br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>As the day of our demise drew nearer, several players decided it was necessary to cross one more objective off of their bucket list and join the MKWPP before it was reduced to ashes. The final three new players included:<br><font color=lime>John Western</font> sent in his prized 8 records he managed to frantically kart with shaking hands. He slots in at 427th.<br><font color=lime>Tim Driebergen</font> submitted 31 PRs to put him at a theoretical 370th. What was the one course time he forgot to write down? It’s too late to go back and check now, but if only he had his Mushroom Gorge PR on hand his 3lap timesheet would have been completed before the world’s demise.<br><font color=lime>Niral Patel</font> was luckier than Tim, in that he managed to submit all of his course times before the tidal wave washed over his home. He placed in at 335th, but probably will have to spend the week bailing out water.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>In an effort to send in those long-hoarded final PRs, 36 players were active over the last two weeks. However no one from the land of unfinished timesheets was active and attempting to join the full AF chart, cementing their position in that dubious group for eternity.<br><br><font color=red>~~The Top 10~~</font><br>The Top 10 was quite active this week, perhaps attempting to put their final stakes in their MKW legacy before the rankings became final. One karter was determined to reach the top spot before the apocalypse destroyed the Earth, and accomplished that. New <font color=yellow>#1 Thomas van Deerse</font> had 8 PRs ovr the last week, cutting 1.1 points of AF and hurdling Shaun Tanney mere weeks after passing Nick Meade for #2. His climb to the top has been long and hard, but it’s finally rewarded with the champion’s crown. And with the impending apocalypse, nobody will really be alive to challenge him, so congrats! The rest of the Top 10 was the usual players. <font color=yellow>#7 Leo Petiard</font> had an impressive 8 PR streak, setting his final time right before the meteors started to hit. Cutting .7812 points of AF, he distanced himself further from <font color=yellow>#8 John Brunn</font>, who continued to play and set one PR. It wasn’t enough to cut any AF, but John will be faithfully back at the news desk next week despite the craters and carnage around.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25 ~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Salvatore Bellusci</font> was desperate to reach the Top 10 before the end of the world, but couldn’t quite reach that position. He sent in three new improvements to cut .15 AF points, but with #10 Aziz Abdullah still 1.5 points away, that goal will now never be realized. The final active member here was <font color=yellow>#20 Liam Ashcroft</font>, who had one last PR to submit, not really gaining any ground on Cole for #19, but every little bit of AF counts when the massive power outages start to happen.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>Nobody played in this group. Either the end of the world selectively hit at each of these 25 players’ homes early, or they just didn’t feel like spending their last days trying to PR. I can admire the latter, but it’s probably just them not playing as usual again. <br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>The bulk of the activity was in this group, where four karters across the range of the group attempted to break those final PRs before it all ended. First up was <font color=yellow>#57 Frederick Hutchington</font>, who sent in three PRs, moved from #59 to #57, and accepted the new times updater job, which now that I think about it means he doesn’t really have to update anymore now that the world has ended. Thanks for volunteering anyway though! <font color=yellow>#61 Christian W</font> had eight new times of his own, moving up one spot on the charts and cutting 1.4 AF points. He was one of the always-active members, so it’s sad we won’t see any more times submissions from him. <font color=yellow>#75 Stacy Needham</font> was probably running around to all seven of the games trying to pad out his combined rank as the power lines started to fall down. He managed to move up a spot with two PRs, and a .35 AF cut. Finally, <font color=yellow>#81 Qi Zhu</font> had a three PR streak, but couldn’t gain any ground. <br><br><font color=red>~~101-Obscurity~~</font><br>Showing the true severity of the situation, six players were active down here, where only one or two ever manage to PR regularly. <font color=yellow>#127 Tom Norton</font> logged on to submit a new SR improvement on rDS, but it didn’t cut any points since he already had the record. The resident Auto expert of the MKW community <font color=yellow>#132 Brett Edwards</font>  was also back, sending in six times (two of which were SRs), to cut three points of AF and move up a spot. Maybe Brett has taken refuge in Peach Gardens while the catastrophe took place, it’s flammable but it’s probably far enough away from Earth to be safe. <font color=yellow>#156 Steven Reinhold</font> had seven PRs this week for an almost 7 AF cut, quite impressive for his rank. Next up was a player who really had some MKW playing to do before the end of the world. <font color=yellow>#196 Andrew Ahearn</font>, previously ranked 424th, sent in an entirely new timesheet, (that’s right, all 64 times), to cut 347 AF points and move up several hundred places. Quite an impressive move, as no one wants to be remembered as third to last on the MKW charts as the world ends. <font color=yellow>#348 Stephen De Winter</font> sent in one time, but due to Andrew’s massive submission he dropped a spot on the charts. Finally, <font color=yellow>#399 Stefan Glosby</font> pulls off a milestone of his own, setting 21 PRs for a 9 point AF cut, and jumping 10 spots up to 399th. Reaching the Top 400 on your last week Is pretty impressive, especially slotting in one spot above the cutoff. <br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Four new records were set, with three changing hands and one being an impressive improvement. “Mr. 1:59” Brett Edwards was back wreaking havoc on rPG, breaking the tie with Reiner on the 3lap and reclaiming the flap from ROM. Sword improved his own rDS to push it achingly close to the sub, while Thomas Petraud pushed glitch rPB down another few tenths away from Alex Shoal. On the site record table, this meant longtime greats Alex and Reiner were pushed off completely, while Brett and Thomas improved from two to three SRs and moved to a tie for 3rd on that chart. Sword still sits high with Lee Duggan with 4 SRs at the top of the table.<br><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach crs</font> time of 1'07\"804 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'07\"342</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square crs</font> time of2'05\"062 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'05\"034</font><br><font color=yellow>Brett Edwards </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens crs</font> time of1'59\"8241'59\"824 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'59\"653</font><br><font color=yellow>Brett Edwards </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Peach Gardens lap</font> time of0'38\"507 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"469</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>The third POW of December, goes to <font color=yellow>Leo Petiard</font>, for 4 PRs and a 1.4 AF cut, moving past John Brunn on the charts and further into the Top 10. <br><br>Keep posted for the end of the year awards coming soon, including 4th POW December, POM December, 4th POQ 2012, and the POY.<br><br>Hope everyone had a happy holidays, sorry for the news being a week late but the stats weren’t updated for last week so only six people would have been mentioned.

We've managed to clean up most of the debris from two weeks ago, and we're ready to make a fresh start in the new year. Let's take a look at the year's first new times.<br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>The new year brought several new players to the site--three in all. And in a shocking twist of events, two of them joined with full timesheets, no New Year's Resolutions needed. If only all newbies were so thorough!<br><br><font color=lime>Geoffrey Ewbank</font> was one of these newbies, his thoroughness possibly stemming from his SMK background. He starts off at the humble rank of 409th, but he'll probably improve quickly once he starts learning how to use bikes.<br><font color=lime>Sack Zero</font> was the other player who joined with a full set. His times earned him a solid starting rank of 112th, and included an impressive Mushroom Gorge Course NonSC time.<br><font color=lime>Fra Lenoob</font> boasted an even stronger MG NonSC time than Zero--2nd on the NonSC charts, in fact--but at the cost of only having 20 course times to submit. He's guaranteed a minimum rank of 319th or so for now, which will probably improve greatly if he ever adds his lap times.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>The coming of a new year prompted a bigger turnout than usual this week, with a total of 33 players working to overcome the AF treadmill even as people around the world hopped on their treadmills to get started on their New Year's Resolutions. Even the laggards in the Land of Unfinished Timesheets caught the spirit of new beginnings, it seems; <font color=green>#283 Tim Driebergen</font> finally filled in his last few times to join the main pack this week. Hopefully this newfound life among the players will last into the year to come.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>Leading the charge, and, indeed, the whole field this week, new champion <font color=yellow>#1 Thomas van Deerse</font> set about distancing himself from the field with new, improved WGM and rDKM laps. He only barely cut AF, but since the inactive players behind him suffered significant backsliding, Thomas pulled away a fair bit, to a distance of a quarter of a point. <font color=yellow>#5 Ruby Aruba</font> was active as well, coming up with a new N64 Bowser's Castle course time, but it wasn't enough to overcome the AF treadmill. <font color=yellow>#7 Leo Petiard</font> was a bit more successful, inching closer to #6 Jak Russo with 2 new PR's on DKSC couse and MT lap. <font color=yellow>#8 John Brunn</font> closed out the Top 10's activity with a small improvement to his rYF course time, which just barely helped mitigate his losses to the AF treadmill.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#11 Salvatore Bellusci</font> has been hard at work on his New Year's resolution to break into the Top 10. He worked off another ~.3 AF with 5 PR's, but there's still just over a full point separating him from #10 Aziz Abdullah. <font color=yellow>#19 Cole Gilbert</font>'s lone rYF course PR did little to help his AF, but that's pretty common when you're already close to the top on a particular course. <font color=yellow>#22 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> made the biggest cut in the group, shedding ~2.9 AF with 7 PR's and passing Fabien Jacques and Alvin Le as he went.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br>The lower half of the Top 50 was the odd group out, as it was far quieter than the rest. Only <font color=yellow>#26 Sebastian Kovats</font> came out to play, cutting the very smallest amount of AF possible with his 3 PR's. He's now less than .3 AF away from #25 Jamie Disley, so just holding his ground again next week could be enough to push him into the Top 25.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Almost 30 places down from Sebastian, <font color=yellow>#55 Tim van Ham</font> made a return to MKW for the new year, improving both his LC times and cutting a bit of AF to end the week at an even 84 points. <font color=yellow>#57 Christian W</font> decided that he wanted to kick off 2013 by submitting 13 PR's, dropping ~5.5 AF and passing 4 players. <font color=yellow>#69 Luke Berrill</font> only improved 6 of his times, and cut less AF than Christian, but he still managed to pass 1 player more than Mr. W due to how closely his rivals were clustered. <font color=yellow>#79 Jon Coppernoll</font> proceeded at a more sedate pace, cutting exactly 2 AF and passing 1 player with 3 PR's, one of which was a new American Record on rYF. This helped Jon to keep his distance from <font color=yellow>#81 Qi Zhu</font>, the last active player in the Top 100. Qi, unfortunately, fell victim to the AF treadmill despite improvements to his MMM course PR and his already highly-ranked DKSC lap. He's still not too far behind Jon, though, so he may catch up again soon.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Not too many players were active outside the Top 100, but they made up for their low attendance with an abundance of PR's. <font color=yellow>#121 Murray Wright</font> sent in a whopping 25 improved times, knocking off ~19.1 AF and flying past 15 rival karters. <font color=yellow>#149 Steven Reinhold</font> didn't do too badly himself, cutting ~6.5 AF and jumping forward 7 places with 13 PR's. <font color=yellow>#400 Stefan Glosby</font> was the only unlucky player of the bunch; due to the 2 new arrivals jumping into the ranks ahead of him, the AF treadmill was turned up to the max for him, and he actually lost a place this week, as well as falling back in AF. His 4 PR's did help lessen the damage, however, and with continued effort, he should start making progress again before long.<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>The first Site Records of the year were both brought to us by Steve Bernelli, who was also in possession of them at the end of last year. It's a good thing he did improve them, since he would have lost the 3-Lap to Thomas Petraud if he hadn't. For now, they both remain tied with Brett Edwards for third on the SR table, with 3 SR's each--one less than co-leaders Tom Norton and Lee Duggan.<br><br><font color=yellow>Steve Bernelli </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time from 2'01\"741 to <font color=magenta>2'01\"186</font><br><font color=yellow>Steve Bernelli </font>also improved his <font color=orange>Maple Treeway lap</font> time from 0'25\"509 to <font color=magenta>0'25\"443</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>4th POW of December: <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font> - With one last strong push, Thomas finally passed Shaun Tanney to become the new site champion. 6 PR's and an impressive ~.8 AF cut helped prove that his lack of SR's didn't mean that he hadn't earned his crown.<br>December POM: <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font> - Thomas completed his meteoric rise to the top in spectacular fashion, improving 14 different times and cutting ~1.9 AF. Despite never claiming any SR's, he was still able to pass Shaun Tanney and Nick Meade to affirm his status as MKW's best all-around player.<br><br>Stay tuned for 2012's 4th POQ, and keep an eye out on the message board for the 2012 POY poll. We'll announce the winners here once they've been determined. Until next update, happy new year and happy karting!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

        "content": "<p><b><font color=red>Update: January 5th - January 29th</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Two new players found their way to the site this month: <font color=lime>Carlo Scarian</font> and <font color=lime>Daniel Berti</font>. I guess they heard my wish last update that more newbies would submit full timesheets, because they both did so, joining the rankings quite close together--Carlo at 277th and Daniel at 266th.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>With 43 players submitting new times, there's a fair amount of activity to cover this update. And not least among them was <font color=green>#187 Anthony Caiulo</font>, who completed his timesheet and jumped in above the 200 mark. Hopefully he'll keep up the good work, now that he's eligible for further mentions in the activity report.<br><br><font color=red>~~1-10~~</font><br>All the usual suspects were active among the players with single-digit ranks. <font color=yellow>#1 Thomas van Deerse</font> managed to keep busy with 2 PR's, shaving a bit more off his AF and securing his position at the top. <font color=yellow>#5 Ruby Aruba</font> didn't quite manage to fully offset his natural AF backsliding, but he came close with 3 PR's. <font color=yellow>#7 Leo Petiard</font> made a good bit of progress with 4 PR's, inching ever closer to #6 Jak Russo. And <font color=yellow>#8 John Brunn</font> stayed alive by improving his DS Yoshi Falls time several times. He still lost some ground in AF, but he did claim the SR, if only temporarily.<br><br><font color=red>~~11-25~~</font><br>John wasn't the only one playing DS Yoshi Falls, as <font color=yellow>#19 Cole Gilbert</font> showed his strength on the course as well, emerging on top for the moment. He didn't improve any of his other times, but he still mitigated his AF drift by a bit. Cole may soon be under pressure to defend his GCN Peach Beach record, however, as <font color=yellow>#20 Liam Ashcroft</font> started closing in on the 1:13 sub there, posing a twofold threat to Cole as he also crept closer in AF. In total, Liam improved 4 of his times, cutting roughly ~0.6 AF.<br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font><br><font color=yellow>#39 Franco Gubser</font> popped in this month with a new Coconut Mall 3-Lap time, which helped keep his AF backsliding to a minimum. <font color=yellow>#45 Daniel Crutcher</font> was active as well, turning in 2 new times to the tune of ~0.5 AF off his total. And just joining the Top 50 is <font color=yellow>#50 Tim van Ham</font>. Tim has been keeping busy since he picked up the game again during winter break, and he becomes the first player this update to move up in the ranks. He submitted 6 new times, cutting ~4.1 AF and passing 5 players to just barely make it into the Top 50.<br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>The lower half of the Top 100 was easily the most active group this update. <font color=yellow>#51 Christian W</font> was a major contributor, though he probably wishes he weren't. With a commendable 15 PR's to report, he would have broken into the Top 50 if Tim hadn't edged him out. As it is, though, he still managed to move up 6 places, cutting ~6.2 AF. <font color=yellow>#54 Danny Gallenberger</font> had the misfortune of being passed by both Tim and Chris, meaning that instead of moving up 2 spots, he stayed right at the same rank, even though he cut ~1.1 AF with his new DK Summit PR's. <font color=yellow>#58 Frederick Hutchington</font> also remained at the same rank, though this is because he was just behind Tim and Chris to begin with. With both of them gone, he's suddenly faced with a bit of an AF gap to cross in order to pass his next rival. Fortunately, he did chip away at it with 3 PR's, reducing it to just over 2 points. <font color=yellow>#68 Luke Berrill</font> found himself falling back in AF rather than moving forward, but he did his best to offset the loss with a new GCN DK Mountain lap time. It was enough for him to pass former Daisy Circuit king Agustin Berrios, so I guess it could be considered a victory. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#75 Stacy Needham</font> popped in with his first 2 PR's of the year, cutting exactly an eighth of a point of AF. <font color=yellow>#81 Qi Zhu</font> also submitted 2 PR's, both on DKSC, though they only barely offset his AF drift. <font color=yellow>#94 Sam Smith</font> sent in half a dozen PR's, making solid progress by passing 3 players and cutting ~1.6 AF. <font color=yellow>#95 Sack Zero</font> was the biggest mover of the group, however, charging in all the way from 112th, improving 18 times and cutting ~22.2 AF along the way. <font color=yellow>#99 Blake Germany</font> rounds out the Top 100 this month. He got knocked down a spot by Zero, but he still managed to improve both his DK Summit SR's and cut ~1.3 AF with 2 other PR's, so he's probably still content with his month's work.<br><br><font color=red>~~101+~~</font><br>Out in the Land of Triple Digit Ranks, <font color=yellow>#119 Rob Jon</font> sent in a lone PR, a sub 1:46 on Moonview Highway, which counteracted the natural AF backsliding he suffered at least a bit. <font color=yellow>#138 Steven Reinhold</font> had a strong run of 20 PR's, which pushed him forward 11 places and knocked almost 16 points off his AF. <font color=yellow>#210 Stan Barmentloo</font> followed suit with his own score of PR's, rocketing past 14 players and cutting almost as much AF as Steven. <font color=yellow>#352 Stephen de Winter</font> was a bit unlucky, getting hit hard by the entry of the new players because of his lower rank. His new Grumble Volcano times would have been enough to gain a spot, but instead, they only limited his loss to 2 places instead of 3. However, <font color=yellow>#378 Stefan Glosby</font> didn't let the new players keep him down. He managed to improve 14 of his times, trying out several glitches for the first time, and cut ~34.3 AF, shooting forward 32 places. Keep it up, Stefan!<br><br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>The only change to the Site Record table this week was that DS Yoshi Falls specialist Clement Blizzard lost his only SR, which had stood for almost 3 years straight. Both Cole Gilbert and John Brunn managed to beat Clement's old time, with Cole holding the lead for now. With it, Cole doubles his SR count to 2, moving up to tied 6th in the rankings.<br><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>improved his own <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross crs</font> time of 1'47\"533 to a time of: <font color=magenta>1'46\"980</font><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>also improved his own <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross lap</font> time of 0'34\"518 to a time of: <font color=magenta>0'34\"382</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat Clement Blizzard's (very) old <font color=orange>DS Yoshi Falls crs</font> time of 0'59\"207 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'59\"137</font><br><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>The community has made their decision: 2012's Player of the Year, by a landslide, is none other than <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font>! Thomas continues the Players' Page tradition by becoming the 5th champion to win the Player of the Year award. He started out at 13th in 2012, almost 25 AF away from 1st, but played consistently throughout the year, steadily working his way up. He finally overtook Shaun Tanney for the title with just a week left in the year, having improved 60/64 of his times and cut ~23.6 AF, or ~63.4% of his total AF. Congratulations!<br><br>The first award of the new year, the first POW of January, also goes to <font color=yellow>Thomas van Deerse</font>. Even though the other players were quite quiet this week, Thomas kept playing after taking the crown to secure his position, earning 2 more PR's and cutting another ~0.14 points, or ~1.03% from his AF.<br><br>2nd POW of January: <font color=yellow>Christian W</font> - A terrific string of a dozen PR's earned Christian this award. He cut ~3.2 points / ~3.7% from his AF and moved up one place to 56th.<br>3rd POW of January: <font color=yellow>Tim van Ham</font> - In a particularly quiet week, Tim's solid ~2.2 point / ~2.7% AF cut stood out. He moved up 2 places to 50th with only 3 PR's.<br><br><br>That's all for this update. See you next time, and happy karting!<br><br><i>~MrL1193</i></p>",

It might not be that interesting, since I'm trying to get it done fast for you, but I hope it fulfills your karting news needs.<br><br><font color=red>Update: January 29th - March 15th</font><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>A fair number of players joined the site in the past 6 weeks. Here's who they are:<br><font color=lime>Michele Gallastri</font>, who submitted 31 out of 64 times. Were his timesheet complete, he would be theoretically placed 246th.<br><font color=lime>Mamadou Kane</font>, who also joined with an incomplete timesheet, submitting 32 times. Mamadou's theoretical placing is 334th.<br><font color=lime>Simone Serra</font>, who submitted 31 times, theoretically placing 344th. Noticing a pattern here?<br><font color=lime>Gabe Mastare</font>, who submitted only 5 times and thus gains a theoretical rank of 418th.<br><font color=lime>Ray Parsons</font>, who beat Gabe in the least-times-sent rankings by sending only two times in. Ray's theoretical rank is 430th.<br>And, last but most certainly not least, <font color=lime>Andrew Knight</font>, the only new player to submit a full sheet of 64 times! Anyone who hasn't is encouraged to follow by his example! He joins the charts and slots in at 305th.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>Despite the long timespan, only 50 players were active during this time. Let's see what happened:<br><br><font color=red>1~10</font><br>Starting off the activity over these past 6 weeks is non other than Site Champion <font color=yellow>#1 Thomas van Deerse</font>. He made two PRs, however it wasn't quite enough to stop his AF from slipping slightly due to the all-too-well-known treadmill effect.  Next up, <font color=yellow>#5 Ruby Aruba</font> made a single PR, also slipping a little further down.  <font color=yellow>#7 Leo Petiard</font> played hard, however, making a large 12 PRs and cutting half the distance between him and #6 Jak Russo.<br><br><font color=red>10~25</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Salvatore Bellusci</font> starts off this section this time, with 2 PRs that helped to negate his natural AF loss, although he still slipped a little.  <font color=yellow>#19 Cole Gilbert</font> and <font color=yellow>#20 Liam Ashcroft</font> made one and two PRs repectively, both joining the trend of making improvements but still slipping.  Finally in this bracket, <font color=yellow>#25 Sebastian Kovats</font>, who made 7 PRs during this time which was enough to jump #25 Jamie Disley for his spot in the top 25.<br><br><font color=red>26~50</font><br><font color=yellow>#26 Jamie Disley </font>leads this group today. Despite making 3 PRs, it wasn't enough to stop Sebastian from barely passing him for his spot, pushing him down one place to 26th.  <font color=yellow>#39 Franco Gubser</font> and <font color=yellow>#46 Daniel Anderson</font> each made a single PR, hanging in there but nevertheless slipping a little.  <font color=yellow>#47 Christian Wild</font>, however, was very eager to make a move, making 6 PRs, and with it, a big leap from 51st.<br><br><font color=red>51~100</font><br><font color=yellow>#68 Luke Berrill</font> played during this time, making 6 PRs and cutting AF but staying firmly rooted to the spot.  Right behind him, <font color=yellow>#69 Qi Zhu</font> made a massive leap from 81st to his current position on the charts, with 10 PRs and cutting over 10 points of AF.  <font color=yellow>#76 Stacy Needham</font> made 2 PRs, enough to almost fully counterbalance the slide that affected so many people.  <font color=yellow>#80 Jon Coppernoll</font> made 3 PRs, but conversely he fell more than Stacy, closing off the activity for this group.<br><br><font color=red>101~436</font><br>Many large leaps happened in this area of the charts.  First off is <font color=yellow>#116 Murray Wright</font>, who made 13 PRs, which certainly didn't net him any bad luck as he jumped up 5 places from #121.  Not far behind him is <font color=yellow>#120 Fra Lenoob</font>, who completed their timesheet and hence landed in this group full of activity.  Not far behind him again is <font color=yellow> #123 Steven Reinhold</font>, who made an impressive 23 PRs which was rewarded with a huge jump from 138th.<br><br>Further down the chart, <font color=yellow>#166 Anthony Caiulo</font> also made a massive effort, making 16 PRs and moving 21 places up the charts.  <font color=yellow>#197 Florian Truetschel</font> joined in on the activity making 13 PRs and jumping up 5 places too.  However, right behind him, <font color=yellow>#198 Daniel Berti</font> will give Florian something to worry about.  Daniel went on a massive PR spree, improving 37 of his times and cutting almost a hundred AF points, giving him a huge 68 place leap up the charts.  As mentioned earlier, <font color=yellow>#305 Andrew Knight</font> joined the charts this week with a full timesheet.  I'm sure he'll keep rising soon since he's made the effort to join with a full set of times.  And last but not least, we have <font color=yellow>#362 Stefan Glosby</font>, who improved 43 of his times, leaving 16 players in the dust behind him.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>5 site records have changed over the past 6 weeks, although only two changed hands, showing the determination of these players to push their own times to the absolute limit.  Sebastian Kovats gained his first SR this week, dropping Salvatore Bellusci's total to one.  Alexandre Agniel gained a second SR, knocking Dylan Imhoff off the SR table completely.<br><br><font color=yellow>Sam Fairless </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'07\"289 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'07\"023</font><br><font color=yellow>Joshua Bernelli </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Maple Treeway lap</font> time of 0'25\"443 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'24\"845</font><br><font color=yellow>Sebastian Kovats </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle lap</font> time of 0'42\"563 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'42\"368</font><br><font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> time of 0'48\"068 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'48\"048</font><br><font color=yellow>Alexandre Agniel </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 crs</font> time of 1'58\"805 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'58\"566</font><br><br><br>Well, that's all from me!

Right behind him, <font color=yellow>#7 Jak Russo</font> improved his DDR 3lap, however he gained no places despite his efforts.  It's possible that he is using this as a Ruse to scare Lee into improving his SR, but perhaps we will see a new person holding this SR soon.  <font color=yellow>#10 Aziz Abdullah</font> also played this week, submitting 4 PRs to maintain his position in the top 10.<br><br><font color=red>11~25</font><br><font color=yellow>#11 Salvatore Bellusci</font> continues to drag Aziz to his Doom as he continues his efforts to get into the top 10, Dashing to make 3 PRs including the RR flap SR.  Old time Site Champion <font color=yellow>#16 David McPartland</font> Bubbled back into life this week, making a surprise PR on rYF, most likely inspired by the recent activity there.  Past the big AF gap in his shadow, <font color=yellow>#17 Liam Ashcroft</font> sLAshed 5 of his times to make a large AF cut, passing 3 players and narrowing the gap between himself and David.  <font color=yellow>#20 Cole Gilbert</font> didn't gain any places this week but improved his rYF SRs, taking down Omega's aforementioned prestigious WR in the process,  which everyone thought was really Cole (Sorry, I couldn't come up with anything better).  <font color=yellow>#25 Sebastian Kovats</font> closes off the Top 25 this time, making an impressive DKSC flap, achieving the Kovated God time.<br><br><font color=red>26~50</font><br><font color=yellow>#38 Andre Hoelscher</font> made 6 PRs this week, jumping 5 players to make a big move, punching a big Hoel in front of him.  Despite falling victim to Andre, <font color=yellow>#39 Franco Gubser</font> managed to move himself into a tie for 39th with Robert van Zanten with a single PR.

Despite Steven Holding tightly onto his Reins as he sped along, Fra proved he wasn't actually Le Noob by staying just ahead.  <font color=yellow>#158 Anthony Caiulo</font> made an impressive 20 PRs this week, saying Cia<font size=1>(ul)</font>o to the 8 people he passed as a result.  Joining the charts this week is <font color=yellow>#168 Nathan Chintagavongse</font> (it's pronounced Chintagavongse), who filled out the remaining holes in his timesheet.  <font color=yellow>#252 Russell Horwood</font> decided to Russell his leaves, making a single PR on LC flap.  <font color=yellow>#354 Stefan Glosby</font> kept up his fast pace of PRs this week, beating another 15 of his times and moving up 8 places, in the process proving to #356 Stephen De Winter that his name is spelt in a superior way.  <font color=yellow>#387 Dave Castaneda</font> Cast his Net and went fishing for records too, catching 13 of them and moving up a place.  Finally, aforementioned new member <font color=yellow>#429 Ryan Hower</font> submitted his timesheet, bringing the Movement section to a close.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Since the last news there has been massive Site Record activity, with 9 records broken!<br><br><font color=yellow>Fra Lenoob </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'50\"864 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'50\"806</font><br><font color=yellow>Michael Penninck </font>smashed his own <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'04\"278 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'01\"820</font><br><font color=yellow>Joshua Bernelli </font>improved his own<font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time of 2'01\"186 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'00\"383</font><br><font color=yellow>Salvatore Bellusci </font>improved his own <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> time of 0'48\"048 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'47\"880</font><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>improved his own <font color=orange>DS Yoshi Falls crs</font> time of 0'59\"137 with the first ever sub-59 time of: <font color=magenta>0'58\"970</font><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land lap</font> time of 0'39\"962 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'39\"842</font><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud </font>improved his own <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium crs</font> time of 1'49\"140 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'48\"979</font><br><font color=yellow>Thomas Petraud </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Waluigi Stadium lap</font> time of 0'35\"448 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"229</font><br><font color=yellow>Tyler Reyes </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Mario Circuit 3 crs</font> time of 1'18\"192 by the skin of his teeth with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'18\"188</font><br><br>Well, that's all from me again!

        "content": "<p><b>Hi.  I know I definitely owe you all an apology for being slack with updates, especially considering I've only just started doing them recently.  As a university student I can't always dedicate time to updating, and I am sorry that you have had to suffer as a result.<br><br>Anyway, I'll carry on now without any more soppy life stories.  Over the last while some people played kart and moved up.  Some people didn't play kart and moved down.  Some people did play kart but moved down anyway.<br><br>So, let's see what exactly happened!<br><br><font color=red>Update: March 27th - April 22nd</font><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Six new players have joined us, so allow me to introduce them:<br><font color=lime>Jay Carr</font> joins the charts with a full timesheet in 113th place, which is surprisingly high for a new player.<br><font color=lime>Cornelius Jacobson</font> also joined with a full timesheet. He enters with a placing of 256th.<br><font color=lime>Nikash Gill</font> submitted 32 times with a theoretical ranking of 368th.<br><font color=lime>Conor Gilbertson</font> submitted 33 times with a theoretical ranking of 382nd.<br><font color=lime>David Delzenne</font> submitted 32 times with a theoretical ranking of 391st.<br><font color=lime>Elias Malave</font> submitted 32 times with a theoretical ranking of 437th.<br><br>Of course, these last four players still have times to submit in order to join the AF rankings, so we can expect them to rise as (if) they complete their timesheets.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>46 people have played since the last update, or rather, 46 people managed to make PRs.<br><br><font color=red>1~10</font><br>This is how the Top 10 looked recently:<br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1VAZcXd.png\" /><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Thomas van Deerse</font> leads the pack this time once again, and he's made another 8 PRs and cut almost 0.6 AF.  <font color=yellow>#2 Shaun Tanney</font> was in pursuit with 10 PRs of his own and cut a tiny bit less than Thomas did.  <font color=yellow>#6 Leo Petiard</font> continued his never-ending progress with yet another 4 PRs which was plenty enough to compensate for any backsliding and edge him ever closer to Aruba's 5th place spot, which is now less than half an AF point away.  And last but most certainly not least is <font color=yellow>#8 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who made 10 PRs which catapulted him into the top 10 by a considerable margin, cutting over 3 full AF points.<br><br>By the way, whoever drew that picture sucks.<br><br><font color=red>11~25</font><br>The top portion of this group was completely inactive, however there was plenty of competition to be had a little further down.  The first of these is <font color=yellow>#17 Liam Ashcroft</font> who, despite making 2 PRs, slipped a little, although a little is a lot less than the AF of the people above him suffered.  Behind him is <font color=yellow>#18 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> who made a big cut, cutting just shy of 10% of his total AF and vaulting over four other players.  And then, right behind him, we have <font color=yellow>#19 Cole Gilbert</font>, who jumped up into a tie with Reinier for 19th place with 1 PR.  The competition continued in this section, and, not wanting to be left out, <font color=yellow>#23 Alvin Le</font> made 6 PRs to make a healthy cut.  And finally, <font color=yellow>#25 Sebastian Kovats</font> made 10 PRs too, since, you know, making a ton of PRs has been such a fad over the last while, cutting of most of the large void that was between him and his next rival.<br><br><font color=red>26~50</font><br>Most of this group have been hibernating lately. Thankfully, a few realised that it isn't actually winter and did play.  <font color=yellow>#26 Jamie Disley</font> was one of those people.  He made only a single PR, but that PR was also a new Site Record.  <font color=yellow>#35 Franco Gubser</font> made an impressive cut, jumping up 4 places with his 5 PRs, keeping up his recent activity.  <font color=yellow>#45 Christian W</font> also gained a place with his 4 PRs.  <font color=yellow>#49 Danny Gallenberger</font> jumps into the top 50 from 55th, making 10 PRs, which is as many as the rest of this bracket combined.<br><br><font color=red>51~100</font><br>This group also saw only 4 people play, although some large cuts were made by those who did play.  First off is <font color=yellow>#59 Luke Berrill</font>, who improved a quarter of his timesheet to make a 7 place cut.  Knocking on his doorstep is <font color=yellow>#61 Qi Zhu</font>, who made 17 PRs and made an even bigger 9 place cut from 70th.  New to the top 100 we have <font color=yellow>#83 Cyril Fulag</font>, who improved a full half of his times to get all the way here from just outside the top 100.  <font color=yellow>#96 Sam Smith</font> also played, but his 1 PR wasn't enough to stop him from dropping a place in Cyril's wake.<br><br><font color=red>101~438</font><br>At the top of this group we have a large number of players all vying for a spot in the top 100.  First in the queue is <font color=yellow>#102 Evan Simmons</font>, who made 5 PRs and cut ~3.7AF points, but surprisingly dropped a spot as Cyril flew past.  However, the gap between him and the top 100 is now very small indeed.  The next person in the queue is <font color=yellow>#103 Fra Lenoob</font>, who looks like he might plan to jump the queue after gaining 11 places with his 6 PRs.  <font color=yellow>#106 Murray Wright</font> also joined in the fun moving up 13 places with 14 PRs.  And at the back of the queue is <font color=yellow>#107 Ashley O'Hara</font>, who made 4 PRs and gets one place closer to the top 100.<br><br>New player <font color=yellow>#113 Jay Carr</font> joins us close to the top of this bracket.  <font color=yellow>#146 Anthony Caiulo</font> beat 19 of his times and was rewarded with a 12 place cut for his efforts.  Further down, our other new player on the AF charts, <font color=yellow>#256 Cornelius Jacobson</font> also joins.  And finally, <font color=yellow>#346 Stefan Glosby</font> continues his endless activity, gaining another 6 places with his 21 PRs.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>There are 6 new Site Records, and also one that changed hands because of a certain frozen player having their account rightly deleted, and I will mention those too.<br><br><font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney </font>beat Fra Lenoob's old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'50\"806 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'50\"792</font><br>After a SR battle with Qi Zhu, <font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney </font> came out on top and beat Marc Bas' old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory lap</font> time of 0'35\"163 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"135</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul-Philipp Baehr </font>beat the old illegitimate <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'34\"642 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'34\"347</font><br><font color=yellow>Joshua Bernelli </font>continued to improve his own <font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time of 2'00\"383 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'00\"100</font><br><font color=yellow>Joshua Bernelli </font>continued to improve his own <font color=orange>Maple Treeway lap</font> time of 0'24\"845 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'24\"483</font><br><font color=yellow>Jamie Disley </font>beat Romain Smadja's old <font color=orange>DS Yoshi Falls lap</font> time of 0'18\"451 by a single millisecond with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'18\"450</font><br><font color=yellow>Andrew Grieve </font>inherited the <font color=orange>GCN DK Mountain crs</font> SR with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'04\"214</font><br><br>Until next time!<br><i>~blahperson15</i></b></p>",

Next, we have <font color=yellow>#7 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who submitted 14 PRs, cut 2.6 AF, moved up one spot, and continues his climb up the AF ladder.

Arriving at the bottom of the group, we see a surge in activity. In fact, #44 through #50 all played with the exception of #47. Shame on you, Oliver Martin. Anyway, <font color=yellow>#44 Daniel Crutcher</font> made 6 PRs and moved up two spots. <font color=yellow>#45 Qi Zhu</font> submitted 20 PRs and moves up 16 whole places. If that wasn't impressive enough for you, <font color=yellow>#46 Cyril Fulag</font> submitted 35 PRs and catapults himself from #83, moving up 37 places and cutting 43 whole AF points. To be fair, though, he probably just released a hoard. <font color=yellow>#48 Danny Gallenberger</font> submitted 5 PRs and moves himself up one place. <font color=yellow>#49 Luke Berrill</font> moves up from #59 and submitted 18 PRs.

New player <font color=yellow>#120 Ray Gredon</font> joins us here, just two places below Anthony. Further down, <font color=yellow>#169 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> made 11 PRs and moves up 2 places, switching places with <font color=yellow>#171 Nathan Chintagavongse</font>, who made 3 PRs but lost 2 places. <font color=yellow>#208 Sam Fairless</font> finally completes his timesheet with 23 new PRs and joins us right after the 200 mark. <font color=yellow>#210 Cornelius Jacobson</font> made 57 PRs, probably hoarded (though it's hard to tell at this rank), and moved up 46 places. <font color=yellow>#304 Nikash Gill</font>, one of the new players from the last update, joins us here by completing his timesheet. <font color=yellow>#322 Conor Evans-Gilbertson</font> also completes his timesheet. <font color=yellow>#330 Pierre Coste</font> moves up one spot and submitted 5 PRs. <font color=yellow>#332 David Delzenne</font> completed his timesheet as well.

Determined to keep up his activity, <font color=yellow>#6 Salvatore Bellusci</font> sent in 3 PRs and moved up one place, despite not cutting AF. Next up, <font color=yellow>#9 Dave Tandy</font> sent in 7 times and cut just under an AF point.

That player is <font color=yellow>#64 Fra Lenoob</font>, who made 22 times and moved up from 91st place - quite a big cut. He also cut over 37.6 AF points. There was some more activity near the bottom of this section, with <font color=yellow>#92 Darragh Williamson</font> making 6 new times and moving up one spot. <font color=yellow>#94 Steven Reinhold</font> submitted some times as well, moving up four spots with two PRs.<br><br><font color=red>100+</font><br>To start off this section, <font color=yellow>#111 Ray Gredon</font> submitted 16 PRs, moved up 9 places, and cut over 6.5 AF. <font color=yellow>#114 Anthony Caiulo</font> also played, making 9 new times and moving up 4 places (although it would have been five if it weren't for Ray). <font color=yellow>#127 Rob Jon</font> sent in 7 new times and cut AF but didn't move up a place. A bit further down, <font color=yellow>#165 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> submitted 19 times and moved up four places.

        "content": "<p><b>Yo, Silver here again delivering yet another news update. First off, I'd like to draw your attention to the MKWii TT rules and policies, made by Zack McNell, which can be found here: <a href=\"http://98.156.6.103/tt/rules.html\">http://98.156.6.103/tt/rules.html</a>. The PP goes by these rules to a tee. Also, don't forget about our YouTube channel at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/mkwpptts\">http://www.youtube.com/user/mkwpptts</a>. Anyway, let's see what happened since the last news update.<br><br><font color=red>Update: June 20th - July 1st</font><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Three players decided to join the PP.<br><br><font color=lime>Leone Castar</font>, better known from MKDD and MKDS, joins us with a full timesheet and a ranking of 389th.<br><font color=lime>Roy Dafuq</font> joined with 56 times and a theoretical ranking of 144th, which is a pretty good start.<br><font color=lime>James Ramirez</font> joined with 23 times and a theoretical ranking of 307th - also not bad considering the amount of times he has sent in.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>49 players went MKW'ing since the last update.<br><br><font color=red>#1</font><br>A huge congratulations to our new site champion, <font color=yellow>#1 Thomas Petraud</font>! He managed to fill out his timesheet and enter the main charts at first place, clocking in at under 5.5 AF points - quite an impressive feat indeed. Totom, I feel like you deserve this:<br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8hryXco.png\" /><br><br>(Credit for the picture goes to the very humble #2 Thomas van Deerse)<br><br><font color=red>2 - 20</font><br><font color=yellow>#6 Salvatore Bellusci</font> sent in 10 PRs and maintained his rank instead of losing a spot due to Totom. <font color=yellow>#7 Dave Tandy</font> sent in 11 times and managed to move up two places. <font color=yellow>#11 Aziz Abdullah</font> sent in three times and cut AF, though he still moved down a place. Last off, but not least, for this section, <font color=yellow>#17 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> and <font color=yellow>#20 Cole Gilbert</font> both sent in two times but didn't cut AF and moved down a spot each (again, due to Totom making everyone drop one place).<br><br><font color=red>21 - 50</font><br><font color=yellow>#32 Daniel Crutcher</font> continues his upward ascent with 6 PRs, moving up one spot. He better watch out, though, because another Dan, specifically <font color=yellow>#33 Danny Gallenberger</font>, stormed through with 16 new time submissions, moved up 13 spots, cut over 9 AF points, and is very close to passing Mr. Crutcher. <font color=yellow>#35 Cyril Fulag</font> also makes a notable cut, moving up 3 places and making 9 PRs. <font color=yellow>#40 Christian W</font> played as well, making 4 PRs, but still lost three spots due to Totom, Danny, and Cyril. <font color=yellow>#48 Qi Zhu</font> sent in three new times, but didn't cut any AF and moved down a spot. <font color=yellow>#49 Luke Berrill</font> played as well and cut three quarters of an AF point, though he still moved down a spot despite his 4 PRs. (I blame Totom again :L)<br><br><font color=red>51 - 100</font><br><font color=yellow>#51 Alexandre Agniel</font> sent in one new time, which was a SR improvement. He didn't negate any AF gains, but it's still something, right? <font color=yellow>#55 Fra Lenoob</font> is right at the doorstep of the top 50, as he made 15 new times, cut 11 AF points, and moved up nine spots. <font color=yellow>#61 Frederick Hutchington</font> had six new PRs sent in and maintained his rank. <font color=yellow>#63 Kyle R</font> had one small time updated, likely an old one, and didn't cut any of his losses. After skipping a decent-sized chunk of players, we reach <font color=yellow>#94 Steven Reinhold</font>, who sent in two times and maintained his position despite still gaining AF. Finally, <font color=yellow>#96 Anthony Caiulo</font> barges into the top 100 with 23 PRs.<br><br><font color=red>100+</font><br><font color=yellow>#108 Ray Gredon</font> continues to even out his timesheet, making 24 new times and moving up three places. <font color=yellow>#127 Rob Jon</font> sent in two PRs and maintained his position. <font color=yellow>#140 Alex B</font> filled out the last few remaining times of his timesheet, dropping in at the mid 100 ranks. <font color=yellow>#163 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> steadily marches up the ranks, sending in eleven times and moving up two places. Next, <font color=yellow>#209 Matt Danner</font> maintained his rank by making in 11 PRs. Farther below, <font color=yellow>#283 Conor Hornsey</font> continues to persevere and moves up five spots with 12 new times. <font color=yellow>#325 David Delzenne</font> made 13 times of his own and moved up three places. <font color=yellow>#354 Alexander Gross</font> also moved up three places by making 19 new PRs. And finally, new player <font color=yellow>#389 Leone Castar</font> joins us at this rank; good on him for actually joining with a full timesheet x)<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Five new SRs were set this time around.<br><br><font color=yellow>Ethan McCormac </font>beat Alvin van Asselt's old <font color=orange>Daisy Circuit lap</font> time of 0'28\"418 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'28\"305</font>.

There's not much to say here this week, so let's jump straight into the karting action :)<br><br><font color=red>Update: July 1st - July 8th</font><br><br><font color=cyan>New Players</font><br>Two new players joined our site this past week, both with full timesheets.<br><br><font color=lime>Matt Striker</font> slips in at 62nd place with his times.<br><font color=lime>Mike Maize</font> joins us at 155th with his PRs.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>45 players were active this week.<br><br><font color=red>1 - 10</font><br>Starting off today's update, former champion <font color=yellow>#2 Thomas van Deerse</font> returns from his short break and continues to play, making two new times and cutting a small bit of AF. Y'know, it would be interesting to see the two Thomas' battle for the site champion, though Mr. van Deerse still has a long way to go before catching up to Totom. Moving on, we see a cluster of three active players. <font color=yellow>#6 Dave Tandy</font> made 12 PRs and cut about two and a half AF points, passing our next active player, <font color=yellow>#7 Salvatore Bellusci</font>, who submitted four times and cut a small bit of AF. <font color=yellow>#8 Leo Petiard</font> also played, submitting 12 PRs and cutting just under one AF point.<br><br><font color=red>11 - 25</font><br><font color=yellow>#13 Olivier Luyckx</font> starts the section off off this time. He completed his timesheet and managed to make everyone below him lose a spot. Luckily, <font color=yellow>#15 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> still managed to move up two spots thanks to his 4 new times. <font color=yellow>#20 Liam Ashcroft</font> and <font color=yellow>#21 Cole Gilbert</font> made four and one new time(s), respectfully, which negated their AF losses a bit but still moved down a spot.<br><br><font color=red>26 - 50</font><br>Another cluster of three is found in the low 30s ranks. <font color=yellow>#30 Andre Hoelscher</font> made two PRs but still lost a spot. <font color=yellow>#31 Danny Gallenberger</font>, on the other hand, sent in 5 times and moved up two spots. And <font color=yellow>#32 Daniel Crutcher</font> improved four times to maintain his rank rather than dropping two spots due to Danny and Olivier. A bit further down, <font color=yellow>#41 Christian W</font> sent in three times and cut his AF losses a bit, though he still lost a spot. Last, but not least, for this section of players, <font color=yellow>#47 Fra Lenoob</font> makes a fairly large cut with his 12 PRs, moving up 8 spots and cutting over 8 AF points.<br><br><font color=red>51 - 100</font><br>New player <font color=yellow>#61 Matt Striker</font> slips in right here, and combined with Olivier from farther up, causes <font color=yellow>#62 Frederick Hutchington</font> to drop one spot rather than gain a spot with his 4 PRs. As we reach the 80s, we find a lot more active players eager to climb up the ranks. <font color=yellow>#81 Stacy Needham</font> played, making 3 PRs and dropping one place rather than two. <font color=yellow>#87 Ray Gredon</font> made a massive cut from 108th by submitting 31 PRs, and is progressing very quickly. Perhaps we'll see him in the top 50 in just two weeks or so. Yet another player, <font color=yellow>#90 Roy Dafuq</font>, completed his timesheet. <font color=yellow>#92 Anthony Caiulo</font> also sent in some times, moving up 4 places with his 15 PRs. Finally, <font color=yellow>#96 Darragh Williamson</font> and <font color=yellow>#98 Evan Simmons</font> both made small cuts with 4 and 3 PRs, respectively. Unfortunately, Darragh still dropped three places, and Evan dropped 6. Too much activity and too many players filling out their timesheets, I assume...<br><br><font color=red>100+</font><br>The activity from the 80s and 90s ranks continues near the top of this section. <font color=yellow>#101 Sam Smith</font> nearly breaks into the top 100 with 10 PRs, passing 3 people along the way. <font color=yellow>#105 Martin Prigent</font> picks up his controller again, making 2 PRs but still dropping 5 places. <font color=yellow>#112 Murray Wright</font> moved up a spot by sending in 11 PRs. Right below him, <font color=yellow>#113 Jay Carr</font> negated his AF losses a bit with 3 new times but still lost 3 spots. The activity stops here, that is, until we reach new player <font color=yellow>#155 Mike Maize</font>, who starts off in the mid 100s but seems eager to move up. <font color=yellow>#161 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> also played, moving up 2 spots with 14 PRs. <font color=yellow>#212 Matt Danner</font> tries to stop getting pushed down too much by making 2 PRs, but still dropped 3 places. And finally, <font color=yellow>#272 Conor Hornsey</font> continues to move up the ranks, submitting 30 new times. I must say, I admire his perseverence.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Three combined SRs were improved this week.<br><br><font color=yellow>Joshua Bernelli </font>beat his own old <font color=orange>Maple Treeway crs</font> time of 2'00\"100 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'59\"810</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton </font>beat his own old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land crs</font> time of 2'04\"353 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'04\"335</font><br><font color=yellow>Tyler Reyes </font>beat his own old <font color=orange>SNES Mario Circuit 3 crs</font> time of 1'18\"166 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'18\"165</font><br><br>I'll also mention all the improved non glitch SRs since April 22nd (where my first news update goes back to).

Dave maintained his position with 6 PRs, cutting a bit of AF along the way.

He only made one small PR, and didn't cut AF, but it still warrants a mention in this update. <font color=yellow>#19 Liam Ashcroft</font> plays, too, and moved up one spot with his 6 times. <font color=yellow>#21 Keiichi Nagai</font>, as stated before, joins us as the highest ranked wheeler, even without a proper Grumble Volcano glitch time. Lastly, <font color=yellow>#22 Cole Gilbert</font> makes 2 PRs but still gets knocked down a spot.<br><br><font color=red>26 - 50</font><br>Eager to move up the ranks, and perhaps to take back his spot as #1 wheeler, <font color=yellow>#29 Danny Gallenberger</font> submitted 7 new times and moves up two places. <font color=yellow>#36 Christian W</font> and <font color=yellow>#37 Fra Lenoob</font> also continue their upward ascent, making 9 and 10 PRs and cutting 5 and 10 spots, respectively. <font color=yellow>#49 Qi Zhu</font> also played and made 4 new times, moving up one spot.

Sucks to suck, Nosey. Activity in the latter part of this section continues with <font color=yellow>#78 Stacy Needham</font>, who moved up 3 spots with 7 PRs. Active player <font color=yellow>#81 Ray Gredon</font> set 14 new times and moved up 6 places. With his activity, he'll get up to the top 50 in no time. We also have <font color=yellow>#91 Anthony Caiulo</font>, who set 6 personal records and moved up one spot.

He moved down a spot, as well. On the other hand, we have <font color=yellow>#110 Mike Maize</font>, who sent in a whopping 50 new times to our site, moving up 45 places and cutting over 64 AF points. Slow down there, Mr. Corn. <font color=yellow>#115 Jay Carr</font> played, too, sending in 9 new times. However, he dropped two places due to getting passed by Mike and by Keiichi causing everyone below him to drop a spot, as well as the fact that there's a considerably large AF gap where he is. <font color=yellow>#145 Alex B</font> sent in one sole time and got knocked down two places as well, thanks again to Mike and Keiichi. <font color=yellow>#151 Tomas Pallaruelo</font> returns to the karting scene and submitted 7 new times, maintaining his position. <font color=yellow>#154 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> continues karting as well with 20 PRs. This time around, he moved up 7 places. A bit further down, <font color=yellow>#207 Matt Danner</font> also continues his PRing. With 11 PRs, he cut 5 places. <font color=yellow>#271 Conor Hornsey</font>, still eager to move up, made 3 new times and moved up a place. <font color=yellow>#317 Andre Riviere</font> sent in one time and maintained his position. <font color=yellow>#324 David Delzenne</font> moved up 5 spots with 8 PRs.

Next up, <font color=yellow>#30 Cyril Fulag</font> made 3 PRs, which didn't affect his AF at all or negate any AF losses. Interestingly, he still passed #31 Ben Hart, presumably because less people beat his existing times. As we finally reach movement in the AF rankings, <font color=yellow>#36 Fra Lenoob</font> made 6 new times and moved up 3 places. <font color=yellow>#40 Matt Striker</font> played too, jumping up 10 places thanks to his 14 PRs. <font color=yellow>#45 Matthias Sempels</font> moved up 7 places with his 7 PRs - looks like 7's his lucky number. And <font color=yellow>#49 Zane Royal</font> played and made 1 new time, but dropped a spot anyway.

Of course, we can't forget about <font color=yellow>#75 Ray Gredon</font> and his unwavering activity. This time around, he made 11 new times and moved up 3 places.

Next, we have <font color=yellow>#175 Michael Penninck</font>, who submitted 7 new times and cut 2 places. <font color=yellow>#202 Matt Danner</font> also played, making 6 PRs and moving up 3 spots.

In addition, they both cut the same amount of AF: .0312 AF points, which may not seem like a lot at first, but is actually quite impressive at their high level. After skipping 3 players, we reach three more active players in a row - <font color=yellow>#6 Dave Tandy, #7 Leo Petiard,</font> and <font color=yellow>#8 Salvatore Bellusci</font> all played since the last update.

Next, <font color=yellow>#57 Roy D</font> continues to make progress. A very diligent student, he made 20 new PRs and moved up 8 spots. Another hardworking person is <font color=yellow>#68 Ray Gredon</font>, who moved up one spot with 11 new times. <font color=yellow>#75 Anthony Caiulo</font> also submitted 11 new times, moving up 4 places in his class rank. Not wanting to be outdone, <font color=yellow>#80 Steven Reinhold</font> barges into the top 100, moving up 24 full spots with 22 PRs, and was the most active top 100 player this time around. Another active player is <font color=yellow>#89 Jon Coppernol</font>, who, despite sending in 1 new time, drops a spot in our rankings.

We also have <font color=yellow>#135 Alex B</font>, who cut a bit of AF with his 4 PRs. <font color=yellow>#150 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> makes an effort to stay active, but loses a spot despite his one new time. <font color=yellow>#170 Michael Penninck</font> cut a bit of AF as well, submitting 4 PRs. <font color=yellow>#198 Matt Danner</font> continues climbing up the ranks, cutting 3 places with his 24 times. <font color=yellow>#212 Sam Fairless</font> improved 7 of his times and moved up 5 places. <font color=yellow>#260 Josh Miller</font> also stayed on top of his work, improving 9 times and moving up 2 places. <font color=yellow>#315 David Delzenne</font> cut 5 places with 9 PRs.

In addition, one player (David Batke) was removed due to being caught cheating, which might have shuffled things up a bit. He's been a bad doge indeed :^)<br><br><font color=red>1 - 10</font> aka the Top Doges of MKWii<br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/4Ngymoa.jpg\" /><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Thomas Petraud</font> played just a little bit with 1 small PR in order to maintain his solid position as the leader of the pack. The \"other Thomas,\" (who allegedly likes to do interesting things with his teddy bears) <font color=yellow>#2 Thomas van Deerse</font> was slightly more active, setting 2 new times and cutting a tiny amount of AF. <font color=yellow>#5 Dave Tandy</font> managed to move up a spot with his 4 PRs (among other no glitch improvements), and is now one step away from becoming the #1 American on the PP. <font color=yellow>#7 Leo Petiard</font>, the most active player in the top 10, also moved up a spot with his 10 improvements. And <font color=yellow>#9 Ruby Aruba</font> found a bit more time to pick up the game and set another PR.<br><br><font color=red>11 - 25</font><br><font color=yellow>#12 Olivier Luyckx</font> continues the trend of passing one person in the race to the top of the AF ladder, this time setting 6 new times. Next up, <font color=yellow>#15 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> (perhaps Thomas van Deerse's teddy \"baehr\") set his eyes upon a certain WR and nearly grabbed it, although that was the only course he improved. If you're looking for the person who ruined his would-be WR, his name is <font color=yellow>#22 Cole Gilbert</font>, who improved 2 times this time around.<br><br><font color=red>26 - 50</font><br><font color=yellow>#31 Velo Lepro</font> (or was it Fra Lenoob?) moved up two spots and continues his constant activity with his 10 PRs. Next, <font color=yellow>#45 Qi Zhu</font> made 3 PRs, though it didn't really do that much for his AF. <font color=yellow>#46 Luke Berrill</font> also made 3 PRs, but they were evidently bigger improvements, since he managed to crawl up 6 spots and rest comfortably in the top 50.<br><br><font color=red>51 - 100</font><br>Kicking off this relatively active section is <font color=yellow>#56 Roy D</font>, who improved five of his times and moved up a spot. <font color=yellow>#58 Ray Gredon</font>, who never fails to impress with his constant activity, made 30 new times and moved up 10 spots. <font color=yellow>#68 Kyle R</font> had a time updated (likely an old one, since he doesn't play anymore) but still lost a spot due to Ray. <font color=yellow>#73 Anthony Caiulo</font> set 8 new PRs and moved up two spots. Active players <font color=yellow>#82 Colin Raptor</font> and <font color=yellow>#84 Darragh Williamson</font> improved 24 and 23 times, respectively, and moved up 15 and 18 spots on the AF rankings, respectively. <font color=yellow>#94 Michele Gallastri</font> enters the AF charts by completing his timesheet, and sits nicely in the top 100. And last off on this active section, <font color=yellow>#100 Jay Carr</font> moved up 5 spots with his 7 PRs.<br><br><font color=red>100+</font><br>In stark contrast to the above section, people here were very inactive. Normally, we see some 101st- to 130th-ranked  players improving their times, but the first active player this time around is <font color=yellow>#136 Alex B</font>. He improved a single time yet still lost a spot. <font color=yellow>#171 Michael Penninck</font> also improved one time and fell a spot. New player <font color=yellow>#203 Martin Haberl</font> joins us at this spot. The only player to actually move up a spot in this section was <font color=yellow>#311 David Delzenne</font>, who improved 8 times. Good on you, David. And the last active player this time was <font color=yellow>#363 Stephen De Winter</font>, who moved down 2 spots despite making 2 PRs.<br><br><font color=red>The Uncharted</font><br>People not on the AF charts who played include <font color=yellow>Martin Fox</font> (if you're wondering what the Fox says, he says \"tastastastastas\"), <font color=yellow>Axel San, Stavros Ferentinos, Scooter S, Sergio Avopei, Dane M, Sora H, Joshua Bernelli, Alex Jascol, Racer Festus, Elisha Thompson, Lachlan Young, Kyon Gulliksen, Daniel B, Andrew Schmidt,</font> and <font color=yellow>Jeff Holtgen</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>6 SRs were improved since last update.<br><br><font color=yellow>Cole Gilbert </font>beat Brett Edwards' old <font color=orange>Moonview Highway crs</font> time of 1'43\"666 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'43\"648</font><br><font color=yellow>Fra Lenoob </font>beat Salvatore Bellusci's old <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle lap</font> time of 0'42\"563 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'42\"533</font><br><font color=yellow>Dane M </font>beat Axel San's old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 crs</font> time of 0'51\"984 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'51\"963</font><br><font color=yellow>Tom Norton</font> improved his own old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine no glitch crs</font> time of 1'51\"304 with a time of:<font color=magenta> 1'51\"213</font>, though Martin Fox had the SR for 6 days as well.<br><font color=yellow>Martin Fox</font> beat Marco van Turner's old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine no glitch lap</font> time of 0'35\"731 with a time of:<font color=magenta> 0'35\"655</font>.<br><font color=yellow>Liam Ashcroft</font> beat his own old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach no glitch crs</font> time of 1'12\"895 with a time of:<font color=magenta> 1'12\"891</font>.<br><br>That's all for now, happy karting :)<br><i>~Silver</i></b></p>",

Unfortunately, a player asked to be removed, but rest assured, your beloved (and, admittedly, irresponsible) news updater has it under control :) This update's AF movements will not include the extra spot earned due to the removed player.<br><br><font color=red>1 - 10</font> aka gold tier lels<br>We begin with <font color=yellow>#1 Thomas Petraud</font>. With 3 PRs, he continues to solidify his position as our reigning champion. Not that it's really needed, of course, since <font color=yellow>#2 Thomas van Deerse</font>, who managed to set 4 new times, still isn't even close to Totom. <font color=yellow>#5 Dave Tandy</font> also played, setting 2 new combined PRs and a few other no glitch times. Breaking into the top 10 with 13 improvements on his PRs, <font color=yellow>#9 Olivier Luyckx</font> was the most active top 10 player. Of course, that comes at the expense of <font color=yellow>#10 Ruby Aruba</font>, who made 3 PRs (one of them being a no glitch WR) but still got knocked down a spot.<br><br><font color=red>11 - 25</font> aka top top lels<br>Determined to move up the ranks, <font color=yellow>#14 Paul-Philipp Baehr</font> set 17 new times, moving up one spot on the AF ladder. <font color=yellow>#16 Liam Ashcroft</font> also moved up one spot, although it only took 2 PRs from him. And, of course, <font color=yellow>#21 Cole Gilbert</font> continues to improve one of his WRs, although it doesn't benefit his AF scores.<br><br><font color=red>26 - 50</font> aka top lels<br>This section in particular seemed to have seen a surge in activity, with some players improving over half their timesheets. Blazing the path here is <font color=yellow>#26 Matt Striker</font>, who sent in 31 new times - nearly half his timesheet! He moved up 13 places (14, really, but the removed player skewed the placements a bit, so we're not counting that for this update). <font color=yellow>#27 Fra Lenoob</font> was overcome by Matt, but still managed to move up 3 places with his 18 PRs. (C'mon, Velo, are you really going to put up with Mr. Striker? What a wimp.) As a result of those two players, <font color=yellow>#29 Cyril Fulag</font>, <font color=yellow>#30 Danny Gallenberger</font>, and <font color=yellow>#31 Jamie Disley</font> all moved down 2 spots, despite sending in 3, 2, and 1 PRs, respectively. It's a good thing they stayed active, though, because <font color=yellow>#33 Roy D</font> is still closing in on them. Like a steamroller crushing everything beneath it, Roy managed to improve 41 times and move up 22 places in the AF ranking. Poor <font color=yellow>#38 Kevin Mason</font> obviously was unaware (either that, or his morale was flattened... get it? Flattened? Like a steam roller? Ah, never mind.), and his sole PR didn't stop him from moving down a spot. Next up, we have another trio of active players, namely <font color=yellow>#41 Luke Berrill</font>, <font color=yellow>#42 Qi Zhu</font>, and <font color=yellow>#43 Ray Gredon</font>. Luke and Qi managed to put up a good fight, moving up 4 and 2 spots, respectively, with their 8 and 4 PRs. Ray, of course, didn't want to be outdone, so he set 35 PRs and moved up 14 spots. What a show-off. Rounding up this section, Mr. \"Inzane\" <font color=yellow>#49 Zane Royal</font> sets a single new personal record, though still was knocked down two places.<br><br><font color=red>51 - 100</font> aka middle lels<br>This section's activity seemed to be somewhat bottom-heavy, as the first active player here was <font color=yellow>#70 Anthony Caiulo</font>. He set 7 PRs and moved up 2 spots. <font color=yellow>#75 Colin Raptor</font> played, too, somehow managing to move up 6 spots with just 2 new times. He managed to evade the movement of <font color=yellow>#79 Michele Gallastri</font>, who moved up 14 places with 22 times. <font color=yellow>#84 Darragh Williamson</font> set 9 new times as well, though he got knocked down one spot due to Michele. <font color=yellow>#89 Andrew Grieve</font> gets a short mention here, as he had one time (likely an old one) updated. <font color=yellow>#91 Jon Coppernoll</font> gets a better mention, since he actually played. He set 3 PRs, although still got knocked down a spot. Closing off this section, <font color=yellow>#99 Jay Carr</font> set 2 PRs, which did not affect his position.<br><br><font color=red>100+</font> aka, uh, okay lels<br>First off here, we have penguin enthusiast and Toad lover <font color=yellow>#102 Tom Norton</font>, who improved one of his WRs. <font color=yellow>#106 Jamie Skepper</font> joined the ranks at this spot - not a bad showing for a new player. <font color=yellow>#111 Blake Germany</font> set a sole new time as well, though moved down a spot thanks to Jamie. <font color=yellow>#130 Alex B</font>, though, moved up 5 spots with his 9 new times. Good on you, Alex. Next up, we have <font color=yellow>#171 Michael Penninck</font> set 3 new times but moved down a spot. In an impressive showing, our next player <font color=yellow>#180 Matt Danner</font> set 63 new PRs - that's his whole timesheet minus one! He moved up a well deserved 18 places. <font color=yellow>#205 Sam Fairless</font> improved 19 times and moved up 8 places. \"The Decimator\" <font color=yellow>#214 Andrew Ahearn</font> set 9 PRs and moved up 4 places. <font color=yellow>#223 Tony Fan</font> set a single PR. The determined and persistent <font color=yellow>#269 Conor Hornsey</font> improved 19 times and moved up 3 places. <font color=yellow>#295 Kyle Fitzgerald</font> joins us at this rank. <font color=yellow>#309 David Delzenne</font> set 9 new times and moved up a spot. <font color=yellow>#339 Alexander Gross</font> set 26 PRs and moved up 13 spots.

The day and month has to be the first three letters, start with a capital letter and be in English. For example, submitting a time on the 10th of October would be \"Thu Oct 10, 2013\". The comma must be issued after the date.<br><br>The clock is also 12 hour so am or pm should be included, without a space between that and the time.<br><br>If you have me, Thomas, or some other times updater added on Skype, we may be able to update your times without having to follow this tedious process, although note that we might be slow in doing so ;)<br><br>Sorry for the inconvenience, guys.</b></p>",

With 8 PRs, he continues to solidify his position as the reigning champion. Likewise, <font color=yellow>#2 Thomas van Deerse</font> made improvements to 5 of his times, and continues to distance himself from the players below. <font color=yellow>#7 Salvatore Bellusci</font> and <font color=yellow>#8 Leo Petiard</font> played as well, setting 9 and 6 PRs, respectively. Meanwhile, <font color=yellow>#9 Martin Fox</font> joined the full charts at a very high (like Snoop Dogg) rank by submitting 24 new times. And breaking into the top 10 is <font color=yellow>#10 Paul Philipp-Baehr</font>, who set 18 new times, including a WR.<br><br><font color=red>11 - 25</font><br>Unfortunately, Fox and Paul's movements caused <font color=yellow>#11 Olivier Luyckx</font> to drop two spots despite his 3 PRs. The same thing happened to <font color=yellow>#13 Jak Russo</font> and <font color=yellow>#14 Aziz Abdullah</font>, who sent in 1 and 2 new times (respectively) yet both dropped two rungs on the AF ladder. Breaking this trend is <font color=yellow>#16 Cyril Fulag</font>, who managed to move up 13 spots with his 26 new times. Due to him and Fox, though, <font color=yellow>#18 Liam Ashcroft</font> was affected as well, as he dropped - you guessed it - 2 spots with his 2 PRs. <font color=yellow>#22 Keiichi Nagai</font> rejoined the Player's Page at this rank, but this didn't affect <font color=yellow>#23 Fra Lenoob</font> that much, who managed to move up 4 spots with 31 PRs. Somehow, <font color=yellow>#24 Roy D</font> managed to top even that feat, moving up 9 places with 37 submissions.<br><br><font color=red>26 - 50</font><br>Unfortunately for him, all the movement above took a toll on <font color=yellow>#26 Cole Gilbert</font>, who made 2 PRs yet moved down 5 full places. On a better note, \"blatant cheater\" <font color=yellow>#33 Luke Berrill</font> set 22 PRs and moved up 8 spots. Poor <font color=yellow>#34 Danny Gallenberger</font> and <font color=yellow>#35 Jamie Disley</font> were stuck with moving down 4 spots each though with 3 and 2 new times, respectively. <font color=yellow>#43 Qi Zhu</font> made 5 new PRs and moved down a spot - better than the two he would have lost if he hadn't played. <font color=yellow>#45 Alex Jascol</font> finally completed his timesheet and slides in comfortably in the top 50, good on you :^). And <font color=yellow>#46 Anthony Caiulo</font> dives into an AF tie with Max Anosova, moving up 24 spots thanks to his package of 39 PRs.<br><br><font color=red>51 - 100</font><br><font color=yellow>#52 Gary Marcos</font> had no problem overcoming the movement above him, setting 13 new personal records and moving up 3 spots. <font color=yellow>#53 Zane Royal</font>, unfortunately, was caught in the midst of this and dropped 4 places even with his 2 submissions. <font color=yellow>#60 Alexandre Agniel</font> faced a similar problem, making 2 PRs as well but \"only\" moving down 3 places. Successfully responding to the need of PRs in order to move up the ranks are <font color=yellow>#70 Ace Firestone, #73 Jamie Skepper,</font> and <font color=yellow>#75 Steven Reinhold</font>. Ace and Steven set 21 new personal bests each, cutting 5 and 7 spots (respectively), while Jamie had the biggest cut of the three, moving up 26 spots with 38 PRs. Next up, we add yet another player who filled out their timesheet, <font color=yellow>#80 Lachlan Young</font>, who made 6 PRs to get on the charts. <font color=yellow>#82 Michele Gallastri</font> played as well, setting 9 PRs, but still moved down 2 places on the AF ladder. He didn't have it as bad as <font color=yellow>#88 Stacy Needham</font> and <font color=yellow>#89 Darragh Williamson</font>, though. Michele set only one new time and moved down 5 spots, while Darragh moved down 4 with his 6 PRs. <font color=yellow>#97 Jon Coppernoll</font> was also affected, getting placed down 5 spots with 6 PRs.<br><br><font color=red>101 - 200</font><br>Managing to maintain his spot, <font color=yellow>#101 Jay Carr</font> played and set 4 new times since the last update. <font color=yellow>#112 Sam Smith</font> submitted one new time but (not surprisingly) was moved down 4 spots. <font color=yellow>#126 Alex B</font> fared better, moving up 5 spots with 11 submissions. <font color=yellow>#138 Rob Jon</font> moved down 2 spots instead of 4 with his 3 PRs - better than nothing, at least. <font color=yellow>#147 Brett Edwards</font> moved up 3 spots with 10 PRs, as well. The introduction of <font color=yellow>#159 Tatsuya</font> into the charts wasn't enough to prevent the PR spree of <font color=yellow>#166 Julian Stephens</font>, who was the most active player this time around with 53 new PRs. He moved up a whopping 88 places, in fact. <font color=yellow>#167 Matt Danner</font> takes the hint from Julian and played quite a bit as well, moving up 14 places with 37 new times. All this activity fazed <font color=yellow>#177 Michael Penninck</font>, who set 3 new times yet moved down 5 places. <font color=yellow>#187 Sam Fairless</font> accomplishes a feat of his own, moving up 19 places with 34 PRs. <font color=yellow>#190 Zack Weber</font> was quite possibly hit hardest with all this activity, and thus moved down 7 places despite a minor return to the game by making 2 new times.<br><br><font color=red>200+</font><br>However, the introduction of <font color=yellow>#213 Hunter Wells</font> (who set 14 new PRs) to the charts also caused <font color=yellow>#222 Andrew Ahearn</font> to lose 7 places, though he only submitted 1 new time. The Julian Stephens of the 200s was evidently <font color=yellow>#232 Kyle Fitzgerald</font>, who set 51 new times and climbed 57 spots up on the AF ladder. <font color=yellow>#263 Conor Hornsey</font> played quite a bit as well and moved up 7 spots with 29 PRs. <font color=yellow>#316 David Delzenne</font> set a PR yet moved down 6 spots, and the same thing happened with <font color=yellow>#371 Stephen De Winter</font>. Filling out his timesheet is <font color=yellow>#387 Rudy Weitze</font>, who only needed one PR to do so. And rounding up the movement for this update is <font color=yellow>#438 Esteban Bonilla Elizondo</font>, who set 9 new personal bests, only to move down 3 places.<br><br><font color=red>The Uncharted</font><br>Players without a full timesheet that made progress include <font color=yellow>Axel San, Ethan McCormac, Troy Howard, Jordan Artz, James Ramirez, Stavros Ferentinos, Tylor McCallumore, Dane M, Harley Gordon, Kevin Kuo, Joshua Bernelli, Dante Dhillon, Sora H, Bob Brannen, Juan Pablo Bravo, Racer Festus, Josh Frahn, Speed Troppelmann, Kyon Gulliksen, Feysal Temptation, Umbre R.B.,</font> and <font color=yellow>Julian OfTime</font>.<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>Lots of new site records this time around.

I meant most pointless. Some guy in some position got a few PRs and is now at an even better position. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Most of the time, nobody gains any places at all.<br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Thomas Petraud</font> lost ground to the chasing pack, but still PR'd 3 times and is still a million miles ahead of #2. If we use the metric system, we discover that a million miles converts roughly to 6.6AF points. Feel free to verify this at your local metric system store.<br><font color=yellow>#2 Thomas van Deerse</font> maintained the Thomas double-team dominance, with 7 PRs and inched closer to #1. At this rate of gaining, Thomas #2 should pass Thomas #1 some time in early 2018. (This is when I hear the next news update is due)<br><font color=yellow>#3 Martin J Fox</font> made fantastic progress with 25 PRs, moving him up from 9th to 3rd, halving his AF. If he keeps halving his AF every 3 months, there's no limit to where he can reach. <br><font color=yellow>#6 Leo Petiard</font> went from 8th to 6th, passing Tandy, Bas and Bellusci. Yes, yes..in this update 8-3=6. It's in revelations people!<br><font color=yellow>#10 Paul-Phillipp Baehr</font>, the man with two names PR'd 8 times and stayed within the top 10. <font color=yellow>#11 Olivier Luyckx</font> and <font color=yellow>#12 Ruby Aruba (haha, really)</font> both PR'd a little and maintained station.<br><font color=yellow>#13 Fra Lenoob</font> took the piss with his name, but PR'd an impressive 26 times and moved up 10 places to #13. If these really are your real names guys, I apologise. Hilarious though.<br><font color=yellow>#17 Cyril Fulag</font>, PR'd 11 times, improved his AF, and lost a place, because mariokart wii hates him. <br><font color=yellow>#18 Roy D (for danger)</font> PR'd 19 times and rose 6 places.<br><font color=yellow>#19 Liam Ashcroft</font> rounds out the top 20, because 19 rounds to 20, with 4 PRs, and a loss of a place.<br><br><font color=cyan>Outside the top 20</font><br><font color=yellow>#27 Alex Jascol</font> is making a case for being inside the top 20. His 29 PRs netted him a very nice 18 places. The top 20 is still quite a bit away, but he has momentum.<br><font color=yellow>#30 Luke Berrill</font> has a little momentum too. 9 PRs. 3 AF points. 3 spots. That sort of consistent pace is what it takes to steadily rise up the chart.<br><font color=yellow>#32 Alvin Le, #33 Matt Striker, #35 Danny Gallenberger, and #36 Jamie Disley</font> are also making steady progress. They all PR'd exactly once in this three month period, and all made steady progress backwards. Guys..you're going the wrong way..you're on a treadmill..be careful.<br><font color=yellow>#37 Anthony Caiulo</font> made 16 PRs, and gained 9 spots. He's now just behind the treadmill gang, but he's running.<br>The last active player in the top 50 was <font color=yellow>#44 Qi Zhu</font>. He made a magic 7 PRs, but it wasn't enough to stop him dropping a spot.<br><br><font color=cyan>50-100</font><br><font color=yellow>#55 Jamie Skepper</font> realises that nobody really cares about people outside the top 50, so he's doing his best to move on up. 29 PRs in the last few months has cut a chunk of his AF, and gained him 18 places.<br><font color=yellow>#62 Ace Firestone</font> took a break from his magic career in vegas to PR 19 times. 8 spots was his reward. And yes, that was the card I was thinking of.<br><font color=yellow>#77 Lachlan Young</font> moved up from #80 with his 9 PRs, passing Cupid himself, Harp Valentine.<br><font color=yellow>#91 ZJ Insanity</font> is the highest joiner on the list. All the other guys did pretty well, but ZJ impressively cracked the top 100.<br><font color=yellow>#95 Kevin Borne</font> is the last player in the top 100, and shot up from #129 with only 13 PRs. He probably submitted some times for the newer glitches, or the stat program is broken. Either of these.<br><br><font color=cyan>100+</font><br>Literally nobody reads down this far, except for people who are ranked lower than 100. Admittedly, that's most of us, but I'm only going to mention the big hitters here.<br><font color=yellow>#138 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> PR'd 35 times and moved up 18 places. Good job Jacob.<br><font color=yellow>#150 Hunter Wells</font> hunted 42 times well, and moved up a staggering 63 places.<br><font color=yellow>#154 Matt Danner</font> PR'd an immense 45 times, gaining him 13 places, and moving him closer to the top 150. Keep going Matt. Remember, 100 is where people start caring.<br><font color=yellow>#158 Julian Stephens</font> made a nice haul of 19 PRs, to gain him 8 spots, to keep him ticking along nicely.<br><br>Honorable mentions to <font color=yellow>#182 Sam Fairless, #231 Kyle Fitzgerald, #236 Matthew Piper, #317 David Delzenne</font> If you're new, and you've been PRing like crazy, it won't show up, because you didn't exist in the database file it's comparing things to. But great work to all those people who joined in this period. <br><br>21 players PR'd without a full set of times, but I don't want to talk about them. 556 players currently do not have a full set of times. That's just ridiculous. I blame the glitches. Also, the stat program doesn't keep track of non-glitch times, so good work with all those impressive non-glitch amazements that will fade into news history, cruelly forgotten.  :(<br><br>Keep karting everyone, and keep joining with ridiculous names. I probably won't do a drive-by news update again.<br>S.</b></p>",

        "title": "A Dusty Reunion",
        "content": "<p><b>Hey everyone, not sure exactly what happened here but there’s quite a thick layer of dust covering the official news typewriter that I had to blow off. So either J-Cop forgot to do his weekly cleaning duties or there hasn’t been a news update since August, and it looks like the latter. If you don’t remember me, I used to update here a few years ago when things were less dusty, but I decided to step in and shake off the rust from the page. Let’s get to the news.<br><br>This news update covers August 31st 2015 to March 18th, 2016.<br><br><font color=cyan>The New Players</font><br>While the newsroom slept, 19 new players joined the page. The players to make the jump to the main AF table included <font color=lime>Stavros Ferentinos</font> at #44, <font color=lime>LeoMK</font> at #206, <font color=lime>Ben Bart</font> at #325, <font color=lime>Leyla Hasso</font> at #448 and <font color=lime>Maia Hasso</font> at #484. <br>The rest of the players to join the page were <font color=lime>Josh Andre</font>,<font color=lime>Nath.P</font>, <font color=lime>Paul Machala</font>, <font color=lime>Sam Hashimoto</font>, <font color=lime>Justin Hitchcock</font>, <font color=lime>ADAM-XL</font>, <font color=lime>NAVSA</font>, <font color=lime>Scr 7</font>, <font color=lime>Max Perkins</font>, <font color=lime>Quinten De Neve</font>, <font color=lime>Hollend78</font>, <font color=lime> Réda 4Vex </font>, <font color=lime>MKWiiManu</font>, <font color=lime>Bradon</font>, and <font color=lime>FlygonMaster</font>.<br><br>A few of these players’ names sound like they may secretly be androids or aliens, but we at the MKWPP pride ourselves on diversity and inclusiveness and heartily welcome them to the fold.<br><br><font color=cyan>Movement</font><br>82 players were active despite the presses staying inactive, let’s cover the movement in the main AF table. <br><br><font color=red>~~The Top 10~~</font><br>No one new joined the Top 10 since last update, which may have led some of the players to get complacent. Only 4 of the 10 top karters submitted PRs. <font color=yellow>#1 Martin Fox</font> submitted 9 PRs, among them five new SRs. Despite this, he couldn’t fight off the rest of the field, losing a few tenths. Similar stories play out with <font color=yellow>#3 Thomas van Deerse</font> and <font color=yellow>#4 Dave Tandy</font>, both sending in a pair of PRs as Thomas stuck to DDR and TF while Dave gravitated towards rDS and rMC3. Both lost some AF but inched closer to their next opponents, staring across some impressive AF graveyards. Finally, <font color=yellow>#8 Luke Berrill</font> logs the first AF cut of the update, with 12 PRs earning exactly 1 point in cuts. He’s getting close to the pair of Nick and Leo, and another six month stretch like the one he had should net him those spots. <br><br><font color=red>~~11-25 ~~</font><br>There was decent activity in the second best group of the page, with <font color=yellow>#12 Olivier Luyckx</font> keeping guard over his esteemed position with 3 PRs. <font color=yellow>#13 Ruby Aruba</font> makes the first positive position change of the update, sending in some solid Top 20 times at rSGB and rSL to vault over Roy D. <font color=yellow>#16 Cyril Fulag</font> moved towards #15 Jak with 3 PRs. He has to watch out for <font color=yellow>#17 Liam Ashcroft</font>, who improved a quarter of his timesheet with three impressive SRs at rDS and MH, jumping four spots from #21. <font color=yellow>#20 Alex Rue</font> hit an impressive 9 PRs to cut 1.2 AF, and has to watch out for further improvements from Danny in the future. Finally <font color=yellow>#22 Dane M</font> hit 6 PRs including a Top 5 3lap on rDS, but was a victim to the rise of the two players above. <br><br><font color=red>~~26-50~~</font> <br><font color=yellow>#36 Qi Zhu</font> hit 5 PRs, holding off <font color=yellow>#37 Roymund Firestone</font>  who sent in 5 of his own to move within 2 points of Zhu’s place. The two might want to focus on their rearview mirrors, as <font color=yellow>#38 Bob Holden</font> sent in 26 records to cut 10 positions and finish right behind the competing pair. Holden’s Top 10 time on rBC3 flap has helped his move, but he’s grabbed many Top 100s throughout this streak, leaving only 18 left on his sheet to match that milestone. <font color=yellow>#39 Hunter Wells</font> came from even farther behind, with a jump from #63 as the reward for his 25 PRs. He cut 20 AF, and looks ready to climb to higher ranks over the dusty timesheets of the retired. Lastly, <font color=yellow>#43 Christian W</font> sent in 6 PRs to hold his ground against the aforementioned competitors, only losing one place as his quiet contemporaries fell 3-5 spots. <br><br><font color=red>~~51-100~~</font><br>Not always an active section of the table, the 51-100 group defied expectation and brought forth many eager karters. <font color=yellow>#58 Zed R</font> made the first move, with 23 PRs dragging him from #76 to just outside the Top 50. Included in his submissions were some solid glitch times as well as a nice Top 40 MH flap. <font color=yellow>#66 Caleb House</font> decided it was time to move, and purchased a nice property 11 spots higher by bribing his realtor with 13 PRs. <font color=yellow>#74 Lachlan Young</font> hit 3 PRs to fend off the competition, but dropped three spots. <font color=yellow>#75 Michele Gallastri</font> made sure to turn up the pressure with 28 PRs and a 10 position move. Right below and looking to get into the shuffle is active karter and part-time wrestler <font color=yellow>#78 ZJ Insanity</font>, who grabbed 23 PRs to move up four slots. His solid times at MG and CM aided in the big move, but he’s also submitted some decent cuts at DKSC and TF. <font color=yellow>#81 Benjamin Zenon</font> hit 31 PRs and slid into the Top 100, with a massive 36 point AF cut. His impressive Top 20 times at rMR, TF, and rDKJP were the highlights of a solid period of karting. <font color=yellow>#87 Jon Coppernoll</font> didn’t write any news, only hit 2 PRs, and is still unfortunately a Green Bay Packers fan. Hopefully he can improve on all of those in the future. <font color=yellow>#91 Mo No</font> grabbed 48 PRs, becoming the second new Top 100 face, with a huge 52 point AF cut, the largest of this update. Finally, <font color=yellow>#93 Darragh J, #95 Augustin Berrios, and #96 Stacy Needham</font> sent in a few PRs each, enough to maintain their positions in the Top 100 and step over a few inactive karters in the process. <br><br><font color=red>~~Everyone Else~~</font><br>Many players were active below the Top 100 cutoff, but I’ll mention those who managed to cut their AF score in these tumultuous times. <font color=yellow>#102 Kyle Fitzgerald</font> sent in 25 PRs to jump 20 spots. He was probably hoping that I had waited another month or two to write this so he could be included in the paragraph above. <font color=yellow>#105 Murray Wright</font> hit 8 PRs, improving the lower ranked times in his sheet in an effort to grab more consistency. <font color=yellow>#109 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> ascended 10 slots with 19 PRs. He’s quite close to a packed group of karters in the 140s AF range, so hopefully his progress continues. <font color=yellow>#132 Sam Fairless</font> glitched his way up 8 positions with 11 PRs, cutting nearly a point of AF. His activity included exploring the rSL and rDKJP glitches, as well as improving on his non-glitched LC and rMR. <font color=yellow>#147 Michael Penninck</font> saw the field of inactive karters as an opportunity, and cut 17AF with 29 PRs, moving from #163 to his present position. Of note is a #4 MR time, as well as a Top 10 rDH flap. Penninck’s focus on the glitched tracks is really helping his position so far, will he turn to some of the non-glitched times to move even higher? Finally,<font color=yellow>#188 Matt Piper</font> sent in 9 PRs to move up three positions and secured his place in the Top 200. (speaking of which, I might have to get around to securing mine soon).<br><br><font color=cyan>Site Records</font><br>In the absence of news, a new DKJP glitch was found that annihilated the old times, with Sam Fairless, Hunter Wells, Gautier Estaloy, and Réda 4Vex all holding the course or flap records at some point before Danny Gallenberger stepped in and snatched both. Also shoutout to Martin Fox, who held the KC, MH, and rDS 3lap records at some point in the news gap but was beaten by the players listed below. <br><br><font color=yellow>Martin Fox </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moo Moo Meadows crs</font> time of 1'15\"840 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'15\"772</font><br><font color=yellow>Martin Fox </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'49\"667 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"537</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall lap</font> time of 0'04\"269 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04\"251</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 0'33\"724 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"170</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine lap</font> time of 0'09\"386 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'09\"365</font><br><font color=yellow>Roymund Firestone </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Daisy Circuit lap</font> time of 0'28\"275 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'28\"273</font><br><font color=yellow>Edvard Tsymbala </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> time of 2'19\"840 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'19\"761</font><br><font color=yellow>Martin Fox </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins crs</font> time of 1'48\"008 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'48\"007</font><br><font color=yellow>Martin Fox </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Dry Dry Ruins lap</font> time of 0'33\"051 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'33\"024</font><br><font color=yellow>Liam Ashcroft </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Moonview Highway crs</font> time of 1'43\"333 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'43\"316</font><br><font color=yellow>Quindarious Gooch </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road crs</font> time of 2'25\"529 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'25\"084</font><br><font color=yellow>Quindarious Gooch </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> time of 0'47\"129 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'47\"124</font><br><font color=yellow>Sam Hashimoto </font>beat the old <font color=orange>SNES Ghost Valley 2 crs</font> time of 0'51\"898 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'51\"319</font><br><font color=yellow>Caleb House </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land lap</font> time of 0'17\"158 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'17\"064</font><br><font color=yellow>Liam Ashcroft </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square crs</font> time of 2'04\"965 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'04\"753</font><br><font color=yellow>Liam Ashcroft </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square lap</font> time of 0'38\"938 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'38\"897</font><br><font color=yellow>Martin Fox </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills crs</font> time of 1'33\"732 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'32\"686</font><br><font color=yellow>Martin Fox </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 crs</font> time of 1'58\"438 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'58\"324</font><br><font color=yellow>Danny Gallenberger </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 DK's Jungle Parkway crs</font> time of 2'04\"844 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'34\"293</font><br><font color=yellow>Danny Gallenberger </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 DK's Jungle Parkway lap</font> time of 0'21\"740 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'06\"944</font><br><font color=yellow>Edvard Tsymbala </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'31\"402 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'31\"270</font><br><br><font color=cyan>Awards</font><br>I’ll see if I can dig back and award some of these if I have time, but I did fix up some old write-ups that were empty from some reassigning a few years ago (including STanney's POQ). <br><br>Hope you enjoyed the grand return of the news, I can’t promise I’ll be any more regular than I was when I was an active updater, but I’ll try to check in every once and a while and do some cleaning.

He did not only improve but managed to get what seemed to be the impossible in the past, the first ever sub 2:19. And with that he slightly improved his own AF. After fox we have <font color=yellow>#3 Thomas van Deerse</font> who wanted to get his AF below 11, he made 1 PR on DDR flap but it wasn't enough to push his AF into the 10 range.<br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br>To start off this section we first have <font color=yellow>#15 Ruby Aruba</font> who has been setting a few American top 10s. And also managed to lower his AF a bit. he nearly cut off 0.8 off his own AF by setting just 5 PRs. Up next we have <font color=yellow>#21 Jascol</font> who set 2 PRs, one of them being an American Record on KC without the use of the mander. he cut .8 off his own AF and is slowly reaching the top 20.<br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Alex Shoal</font> made 1 PR on GV, but still lost some AF points.

He managed to pass 3 players with only 4 PRs, and cut off 3 AF. Followed by our tree hugger <font color=yellow>#68 Caleb House</font> who made 1 PR, but still lost 1 spot due to Sosis. Up next we have <font color=yellow>#70 ZJ Insanity</font> who made 3 PRs and managed to enter the top 70 with that. <font color=yellow>#72 Brendan Payne</font> attained 1 PR, which was a sub 1:57 on CM, quite an achievement for someone who has been out of the scene for so long. <font color=yellow>#81 Zack McNell</font> who got 1 PR and also passed 1 player with that.<br><br><font color=red>100-499</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#129 Blake Germany</font> who managed to get 1 PR and cut over 1 AF with that.

He joined with a full timesheet, highlighted by some strong glitch times.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#95 David Morton</FONT> made the biggest move this update, passing an impressive 43 players with 23 PRs.</b><br><br><b>The Ticketless:</b><br><br><b>We'll start this section with another nice WR.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#103 Darragh J</FONT> improved his own Peach Gardens record.  The last 9 world records on this track were all his, and he's had the record uncontested since 2014.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#108 Bjorn Rieb</FONT> is a relatively new player.

He submitted an entire time sheet in January.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#359 Ben Porter</FONT> was a victim of bad luck.  He improved his AF with 10 PRs but was still bumped down 1 spot.  We'll finish this section with <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#459 Greg Howard</FONT>.  Greg did some damage to his timesheet.  He demolished 47 of his PRs, cutting exactly 29 AF and passing 19 people.

Now let's talk about Mario Kart Wii activity from March 18th-May 27th.  Since our last update, there were too many active players to count, 19 new site records (!), and 4 new passengers.  The new passengers are <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">Sebastian Kovats</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">Justin Barton</FONT>, <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">Alex Garcia</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">Alex Nieminen</FONT>.  Welcome aboard, gentlemen!</b><br><br><b><FONT COLOR=\"#00FFFF\">Activity</FONT></b><br><br><b>First Class:</b><br><br><b>We'll kick things off with former champ and current news co-writer, <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#3 Thomas van Deerse</FONT>.  He writes the news when I don't feel like doing it, and politely reminds me to do my share of the work when I forget it's my turn to do an update.  His 5 PRs put him within .6 AF of #2.  Just behind him, <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#4 Justin Hitchcock</FONT> cut an impressive 12.7 AF with his 33 new PRs, moving himself up 11 spots to join the top 5.  The next active player was <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#6 Nick Meade</FONT>, another former champ.  He cut almost 3 points from his AF with 11 PRs, mostly on those pesky glitched courses.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#8 Arvo Koskikallio</FONT> made a nice move, jumping up 6 spots with 20 PRs.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#9 Nils Stoffers</FONT> passed 3 players, but was also passed by 2, so his net gain is 1 spot.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#10 Zed R</FONT> had 2 new PRs, but he fell victim to Justin, Arvo, and Nils, falling back 3 spots.  Our last passenger in first class is <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#20 David Morton</FONT>.  David put up some big numbers.  He cut 41 AF with 33 PRs to pass 28 people.  Excellent work, David!</b><br><br><b>Coach:</b><br><br><b>This group starts with <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#25 AJ Rangthale</FONT>.  AJ didn't go anywhere, but he improved his AF with 5 PRs.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#27 Jascha Richter</FONT> (a Canadian) had 9 new PRs, including double WRs on N64 Mario Raceway.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#31 Alex Shoal</FONT> (also Canadian) made his return to the WR standings by tying the world record on DS Yoshi Falls.  The other half of that WR tie is our next active member, <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#33 Vincent Braixen</FONT>.  Vincent cut 24 AF with 21 PRs.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#40 Ross Coleman</FONT> joined the top 50 thanks to his 37 PRs.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#42 Jacob Fitzgibbon</FONT> made a nice 5 point cut to his AF to hold his ground against the guys who flew up the charts.  Our highest-ranked newcomer this time around is <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#43 Sebastian Kovats</FONT>, who makes his debut in the top 50.  If you look a wee bit further down the list, you'll find <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#70 WiiLord95</FONT>.  Hiding behind the fakest of fake names, he moved up 13 spots over the last 2 months.  <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#89 Timothy Santoro</FONT> cut a massive 54.5 from his AF to pass 47 players and join the top 100.  Our last coach player worth mentioning is <FONT COLOR=\"#ffff00\">#99 Jordan Artz</FONT>.

Keep up the good work Justin! <font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font> followed along and set 28 PRs and cut nearly 8 AF, he also passed 3 players by doing so. The most noteable cut for him must have been finally getting a glitch PR on rDKJP. <font color=yellow>#6 David Morton</font> attained 16 PRs, cut nearly 4 AF and also passed 3 players. His most noteable achievement was his rDH glitch PR getting the ER + 2nd WW. The last person in this group to play was <font color=yellow>#7 Zed R</font> set 19 PRs and clumb all the way up to 7th, he nearly cut 4 AF aswell.<br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br>The first person in this group to play was <font color=yellow>#11 Vincent Braixen</font> who set a bunch of PRs aswell, 18 to be exact. The two noteable of those were his MT glitch WR and his rDKM PR getting 2nd worldwide barely missing the sub 2:00 mark. By cutting over 6 AF be clumb all the way from 17th to 11th.

Setting 18 PRs and passing 11 players. Cutting over 20 AF, but more importantly since the quacker is now a viable vehicle on GV glitch he managed to get his first WR by using the quacker!

        "content": "<p><b>Hey all TTers and TTesses. I am Arvo, your new news updater. You will learn to love me. Since Thomas and J-Cop are pretty busy guys, we came to the agreement that we needed someone new, preferably someone with way too much free time. I think I fit this description perfectly, so I'll hopefully be writing these more than the community has been used to over the past year or so. Without too much more rambling, let's recap the nearly four months of progress we've made. This is my first time doing this, and all the data is quite overwhelming and I'm bound to make a few mistakes sooooo... Go easy on me?<br><br>This news update covers from March 12th to July 3rd 2019<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime>Shatterdpixel , Jacob Loerzel , Steven Quincy , Mick Lorenger , Indy Kambeitz , Enzo Leussink , Tristan , BuzzyWuzzy , Alex Wolf , Alexander W , NateSM , Peyton Gunn</font> <br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br>First of all let's clap it up for the main man <font color=yellow>#1 Justin Hitchcock</font>. Very soon after the last news update he manage to pass Fox as our newest site champion. Fox held the #1 spot for a HUGE 1426 days until someone finally beat him. Great job Justin, I'm guessing he's gonna be site champ for at least 1000 days aswell. Oh yeah, he also got 28 PR's since the last update and now holds 48/48 American tops. Insane. Next up is <font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font>, that's me! Over the past few months I set 17 PR's and cut 2.5 AF. I played a lot of flaps and managed to snag 3rd worldwide during the Sherbet Land revolution. Those tops lasted about 3 days.<br><font color=yellow>#6 David Morton</font>, the Geordie machine has been playing aswell. The 2nd worldwide curse continued for him when he finished a Sherbet Land glitch time only around 2 frames behind the WR at the time. Ouch. I know you can do it mate! The next player to have improved is <font color=yellow>#7 Zed R</font>, who managed to get 14 PR's and cut around 1 AF. Since he is German, I will also mention that he got the Maple Treeway Country Record! Glückwunsch!<br>Next up, the veteran himself <font color=yellow>#8 Nick Meade</font>. Even though his Race to 9999vr has been keeping him occupied, he's still managed to find some time to get a couple of new PR's over these months, mainly glitch tracks like MT and rDH for some of that fat AF. He managed to cut 1.6 AF with only 5 PR's so it's definitely working. I also would like to give him a special shoutout for all the work he's been doing on his YouTube channel to keep the TT scene fresh with his high-quality Time Trial-related videos. Major respect to you brother. And then over to <font color=yellow>#9 Vincent Braixen</font> who's been religiously grinding for the rYF record, which he finally achieved in late May. He was also the second person to sub 1:56 on Coconut Mall no-glitch and the second person to sub 2:00 on DKM glitch. Great stuff, Brak! (Oh yeah he also managed to climb 2 placements with these, mostly due to a big oopsie that we'll get to at the end).<br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br>First up, <font color=yellow>#18 AJ Rangthale</font>. Sosis managed to improve his Sherbet Land no-glitch WR twice recently and even managed to get a glitch time! He also managed to come out of nowhere with a 5th Worldwide time on Mario Raceway, until he was pushed back to 6th by a certain robotic mastermind. He managed 5 PR's (and at this point I'm realizing the stats only count PR's on the combined rankings). Anyways, congratulations Sosis, good luck for more on Sherbet Land!<br>Next is <font color=yellow>#22 JoshuaMK</font> who recently improved his LC time by just 25 milliseconds, but he managed to hit a 22 second lap 3 in his run. Boy's got potential! <font color=yellow>#23 Ruby Aruba</font> also improved twice since the last update, the main thing to look at here is his 2nd worldwide and the 2:12 sub on rDKJP no-glitch. Congrats Aruba, I'm sure that has been way overdue. Next up is the angry scot RC - <font color=yellow>#24 Ross Coleman</font>. He's managed a gnarly 25 PR's since the last update, the main things being his 3 different WR's on the rSL glitch and worldwide tops on rSL no-glitch. Icy tracks for the Iceman. Cutting off a massive 8.7 AF and climbing 6 positions since the last update, he's actively trying to become the #1 spearscrub in all of MKW, achieving the Spear BKT on Mushroom Gorge and always trying to find ways to PR with the spear on any track possible, including Maple Treeway no-glitch. I'm sure he'll try to make 3/3 DKM glitch with spear at some point in the future. <font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> has been playing a lot aswell, he's been keeping up busy over at MKLeaderboards, having to update almost every single one of his improvements on the European tops. He's achieved 16 different PR's and cutting almost 4 AF. Still, due to Ross' improvements, Steve managed to drop a spot in the rankings.<br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Danny Gallenberger</font> attended SGDQ! Other than that, he also managed to get 2 PR's over these months. Due to the rSL glitch revolution, he managed to find the motivation to get himself a nice improvement, the other improvement being the flap in the same run. Good going Danny! <font color=yellow>#29 Aziz Abdullah</font> has also found some time to play, managing to get a very impressive 3rd worldwide on Moonview Highway. Congrats!<br><font color=yellow>#31 Alex Shoal</font> managed to do what he does best, he's been slowly climbing up the tops on Peach Gardens with automatic, currently sitting in 6th place. He also beat the Mick's ancient Spear BKT on MMM and improved his time on rYF. Keep it up dude! Then the other Canadian. <font color=yellow>#33 Jascha Richter</font> improved his already insane rMR time by another .1 and then disappeared again. I wonder when and where he's going to strike again. <br>Next is my man <font color=yellow>#34 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> who cut over 6 AF with his 15 PR's. He's been mostly improving his timesheet on the search for overall improvement but did go out of his way to make sure the rSL revolution didn't happen without him. He's still hanging on to 10th worldwide there, but I'm sure with how the things are going there, he's going to have to fight to hold on to those tops! <font color=yellow>#36 Dane Allen</font> has cut off nearly 9 AF and climbed up 5 spots on the rankings to be next to the other Dane. Aww! But <font color=yellow>#38 Jake Harrison</font> might be splitting them up soon, because he's managed to gain a monstrous 17 AF and climb 13 positions with his 22 PR's. Insane! Next, everyone's favourite instant miniturbo-using <font color=yellow>#41 Timothy Santoro</font> has also gained a huge 11.5 AF points and climbed 9 positions with 10 improvements, one of them being the WR with my personal favourite Mii name out of any WR! Congrats on the gains bro.<br>Up next is <font color=yellow>#45 Caleb House</font> who managed to barely miss the 50 second sub on MC glitch but regardless, his time has come a long way from 592. He improved on LC aswell, and hopped on for the rSL revolution. He may or may not also be aiming for the 2/3 glitch there. Only time will tell if king Taylor will reign for eternity. Just being able to write <font color=yellow>#48 WiiLord95</font> on this news update sparks joy. He may only have gotten 1 improvement, a Mario Circuit glitch flap just over a week after the last news update, but he'll be back. Be ready. July 9, 2019. (Please don't improve MC no-glitch the tie needs to stay :()<br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#51 Hunter Wells</font> played Sherbet Land. Next! <br><font color=yellow>#56 Paul Machala</font> hit too many insane times to list, but let's mention his rDH no glitch WR and the 3rd worldwide on WGM no glitch. I hope to see his name on here next news update, too! <font color=yellow>#60 Carter Clem</font> hates BC3. He got a couple of other PR's but the main one was definitely getting worldwide tops back on MT glitch. Congrats! <font color=yellow>#67 Lachlan Young</font> managed just one PR on rWS, but it's enough to get his name here! Now here's the big one. <font color=yellow>#68 Wilf Lovatt</font> has managed to cut off an insane 68.4 AF with 31 PR's climbing 66 positions! Absolute unit. I'm sure the big one for him was improving his rDH glitch time for the 100th time to get 6th worldwide. Congratulations, this was the biggest AF gain out of everyone during this timeframe.<br><font color=yellow>#73 Mo No</font> has been consistently setting PR's here and there. This time he's managed to get 6 of them. Straight quote from him: \"The less I play, the more often I pr\". Keep doing what makes you happy, mein freund! Next up is another man who's improved a ton over the past few months. <font color=yellow>#94 Vincent Nguyen</font> managed to cut over 48 AF and climb 42 spots since the last update, really getting some strong times aswell, such as his 7th American on GV2 glitch as well as 2/3 on DKJP glitch which somehow doesn't make regionals. Madness, I tell you.<br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#108 Yoshi Christan</font> took a break from telling me to do better in lounge and set 2 PR's, one of them being the big 2:31 on rBC. Congrats Christan, now let me hit walls in peace. <font color=yellow>#117 Logan Tracey</font> does not hit walls. He flexes on opponents, even getting the first ever tied WR on a glitch category with Ross on rSL. Logan cut off 8.6 AF and has been gunning for the 1:28 on Daisy Circuit. You can do it. <br><font color=yellow>#123 Tom Norton</font> dressed up as Funky Kong. He also managed to get closer and closer to reclaiming his rDS WR from Luke, but fell just a bit short. Let's hope you get it one day or AI will take over. <font color=yellow>#153 Shawn Berry</font> improved just 4 times, but managed to sub 1:51 on WGM no-glitch! Well done Shawn! Next, <font color=yellow>#158 Edvard Tsymbala</font> played Sherbet Land. He's keeping up his annual PR schedule, hope to see something from you in 2020! <font color=yellow>#161 Idriz</font> on the other hand went crazy over these months cutting 23.7 AF and climbing 17 positions. He also got one of the craziest WR's this year in my opinion with his 21.0 on MG glitch. Great stuff!<br><font color=yellow>#186 Daniel B</font> Loves Daisy a bit too much. He's improved on DKJP, getting worldwide tops and a great improvement on Daisy Circuit aswell. He also got a very fast 20.1 flap on rYF, thankfully with Funky this time. <font color=yellow>#197 Kenneth Bernales</font> finished his timesheet and has been updating his times very consistently. Welcome to the top 200!  :P<br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#241 Connor GB</font> managed to cut 48.6 AF and climb 38 positions with 24 PR's. Now that's sumtin to be proud of! <font color=yellow>#265 Jeroen Schepers</font> Finished his timesheet. Congrats and welcome! <font color=yellow>#284 Bradon</font> (Other Info: Twin brother of Zachary) got 1 PR, a 01:20.181 on rMC3. Good luck on sub!<br>And finally, a guy simply named <font color=yellow>#535 Tristan</font> also finished his timesheet. Let's go!<br><br>Site Records:<br><br><font color=yellow>Idriz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'22\"406 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'21\"015</font><br><font color=yellow>Idriz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'04\"940 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'04\"466</font><br><font color=yellow>Bryce </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 0'49\"721 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'49\"092</font><br><font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'31\"615 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31\"554</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> time of 2'18\"396 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'18\"260</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape lap</font> time of 0'43\"967 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'43\"957</font><br><font color=yellow>Timothy Santoro </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 0'18\"474 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'17\"840</font><br><font color=yellow>Enzo Leussink </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano lap</font> time of 0'04\"306 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'03\"561</font><br><font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Yoshi Falls crs</font> time of 0'58\"775 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'58\"747</font><br><font color=yellow>Jascha Richter </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Mario Raceway crs</font> time of 1'41\"464 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'41\"358</font><br><font color=yellow>Blaze </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land crs</font> time of 1'43\"133 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'36\"697</font><br><font color=yellow>Blaze </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land lap</font> time of 0'16\"529 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'11\"220</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Delfino Square crs</font> time of 2'04\"451 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'04\"296</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 crs</font> time of 1'57\"981 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'57\"627</font><br><br><br>As a bonus I'll add the no-glitch times aswell.<br></b><i>cough cough ego boost</i><b><br><br><font color=yellow>Arvo Koskikallio </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge no-glitch flap crs</font> time of 0'31\"396 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31\"376</font><br><font color=yellow>Joe Beaton </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall no-glitch crs</font> time of 1'55\"793 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'55\"731</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine no-glitch crs</font> time of 1'50\"705 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'50\"663</font><br><font color=yellow>Blaze </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano no-glitch crs</font> time of 1'52\"060 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'51\"726</font><br><font color=yellow>AJ Rangthale </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land no-glitch crs</font> time of 2'03\"921 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'03\"825</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul Machala </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills no-glitch crs</font> time of 1'34\"700 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'34\"520</font><br><br><br>One more thing, just in case someone is unaware, Dennis Colvin turned out to have cheated a lot of his runs and admitted to being an alt of Zomothy (Who I to be honest, don't have a clue who he is).

The Shy Guy Beach flap-only glitch where you have to wait 3 minutes for the Shy Guys to commit a terrorist attack at just the right place of THEIR OWN TRACK to somehow generate airtime from a powerful explosive. Great job Nintendo! Thanks to this, I'm predicting that there will be a lot of people who have had exactly one improvement over these three weeks. Let's get into the update gamers!<br><br>This news update covers from July 4th to July 28th 2019<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime>Tubiek , Victor Alicea , Shane Hogan, Omar Martinez Ramirez</font> <br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Justin Hitchcock</font> got a 17 second flap on rSGB in like 2 days and made everyone else look like a bunch of fools. He also got the first sub 11 flap on rSL glitch and a snazzy PR on rMR. He also managed to sub 7 AF and sub 14 minutes on the overall flap times. It's been a pretty flap-oriented month as you can tell. <font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font> is busy filling the huge void between 15-30 AF, it's pretty chill here. I've been playing everything BC3 and some rSGB on the side. Unfortunately the progress has been a bit slow so I only managed 2 PR's and the big 2:17 on no-sc after sucking for 4 days.<br>Next up is <font color=yellow>#6 Big Dave</font> who also participated in the popular pastime for waiting 3 minutes and shouting at the hitbox of an explosive device. He did manage to get a flap there eventually though, congratulations mate! Next, <font color=yellow>#9 Vincent Braixen</font> improved his CM glitch WR once again. He started playing a bit of Wii Sports after that but also managed to get a rSGB flap on day 1. 4/4 people so far have had a SGB flap, this is going to be a fun news update.<br><br><font color=red>Ross Coleman</font><br><br>So yes, the only player to improve from 11-25 this month is  <font color=yellow>#23 Ross Coleman</font>. He managed to transform into the Flying Scotsman and get an 18 second flap on rSGB. He also played 3lap on rSGB and recounted most of the swear words in the English language (and some other Scottish nonsense) while missing lows on lap 3. Good luck for regionals laddie. Ross also crushed Aruba, climbing one spot.<br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#31 Alex Shoal</font> is loving automatic and slowly climbing the rPG leaderboards, passing his fellow Canadian Jascha. He's currently sitting in 5th place. Congratulations! Another man from the Great White North, <font color=yellow>#32 Jake Harrison</font> might be the loudest man I've ever heard in my life but has also somehow screamed his way up 6 positions on the rankings, good job! There's too many improvements to highlight just one, but his potential on BC3 no sc shouldn't be overlooked. Top 25 this this year for sure, eh?<br><font color=yellow>#35 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> may have lost a spot to Jake, but he's been doing great work, on and off the track. He's been using the 3 minute waiting times on rSGB flap to benefit the community by going on adventures on ninrankings and chadsoft, keep up the work you legend! Jacob's mostly been playing flaps as he does, achieving the big 18 over on the waiting game category, but has also recently gotten into rGV2, getting flap tops and improving his 3lap time on the glitch category while also getting an impressive 53.3 on the no-glitch side. Next, <font color=yellow>#36 Dane Allen</font> slammed into the tree on rPB and disappeared. At least he's still next to the other Dane on the rankings. <font color=yellow>#39 Tony Ros</font> and <font color=yellow>#42 Mark Schmidt</font> have not returned to the game, but Jacob did some investigative work and found some missing times just so I could write their names on the news update. Thank you Jacob!<br><font color=yellow>#44 Caleb House</font> has been improving some of his older times but also got a 1:32 on rDH glitch and managed to join in the rSGB waiting squad with a very low 19 second flap. Good job Mr. House! <font color=yellow>#46 David McPartland</font> has gotten his name mentioned thanks to Jacob again, I'm pretty sure. I dread that this is not the last time I will get to write <font color=yellow>#48 WiiLord95</font> on here, he made a <u>controversial</u> exit video over on his youtube channel, but I hope to see him play here and there again, good luck with whatever you do regardless :) To end this group of players we have <font color=yellow>#48 Hunter Wells</font> who climbed his way onto the top 50 during this timeframe thanks to his ALL UMBRELLAS OPEN BKT on the supreme category. Great job fella.<br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#51 Clement Rouchon</font>, <font color=yellow>#58 Jamie Disley</font>. Thanks Jacob! Let's get to people who actually played. <font color=yellow>#61 Wilf Lovatt</font> the Sheffield Superstar continued his AF gains by another 3.5 points. He also managed to finally get the 3/3 on rDH glitch and get 1:32 just like Caleb. He also climbed another 7 spots. See you in the top 50 next news update! <font color=yellow>#63 McCoy Brown</font> finished his timesheet so I had to edit this news update. Good job pal! :) <font color=yellow>#75 Max Anosova</font>, <font color=yellow>#83 Robert van Zanten</font> and <font color=yellow>#84 Mickael Smolen</font> have not played either. Jacob giving so many shoutouts to old players, thank you again! <font color=yellow>#90 Vincent Nguyen</font> on the other hand, has played. He climbed 4 positions on the rankings, but more importantly got himself WW tops on rGV2 glitch and regionals on GV glitch. Yes mate.<br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><font color=yellow>#107 Dylan Imhoff</font>. Starting to question if Jacob's the only one adding these times. Shoutout to Zack this time. <font color=yellow>#110 Darragh J</font> has surprisingly actually played. He got a new PR on MMM as well as a rDKJP improvement. Still, the archive page says he's got 6 new PR's this month so I'm still suspecting some Jacob effect. Talking about Jacob, <font color=yellow>#111 Yann Deptia</font> has apparently got 8 PR's even thought his last PR was in 2011. Nice. And with <font color=yellow>#123 Tim Shelbourne</font> getting 20 ghost PR's I'm going to only mention people that have played. Sorry for being a bit lost lads.<br><font color=yellow>#137 Michael Penninck</font> snatched himself a nice PR on rBC. <font color=yellow>#147 Alex Bjorkman</font> made his comeback earlier this month with some nice PR's, most notably a very nice time on rMC3. <font color=yellow>#160 Idriz</font> was on holiday but got right back to work when he got back. He played a few flaps but also tried his luck on GV glitch, getting pretty close to sub 20 there. Good luck Idriz! <font color=yellow>#192 Kenneth Bernales</font> managed to cut 1.1 AF with 7 PR's and climbed 6 positions on the rankings. Good job!<br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br>My fellow map enthusiast <font color=yellow>#219 Leon Bisschops</font> finished his timesheet with 8 PR's this timeframe. Congrats maatje! <font color=yellow>#234 Neige LDN</font> was mental this month. He got 29 PR's and cut a massive 37 AF climbing 27 positions. Great job! <font color=yellow>#262 Jeroen Schepers</font> cut 11 AF and climbed 5 positions with 13 PR's. Very impressive! Next up is <font color=yellow>#269 Aaron Burr</font> who finished his timesheet this month. Good job and thank your for appreciating quality music. The twin brother of Zachary is back again, <font color=yellow>#281 Bradon</font> climbed up 5 spots with 12 PR's. Nice! Next up is the MKDS madman <font color=yellow>#302 Max Itzkowitz</font> who came back to get a couple of PR's. He is also not European. Good job, even though you're a yankee.<br>Then we get to the man who deserves a star sticker. <font color=yellow>#318 Darien L</font> managed to cut off a massive 55.6 AF climbing 41 positions with 22 PR's. Good job on doing a mass update Bawp, this was the biggest AF and spot gain this timeframe. And finally to end up the players, <font color=yellow>#330 MKWilliam</font> improved BCWii flap and 3lap. Go on lad.<br><br>Site Records: <br><br><font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Coconut Mall crs</font> time of 0'31\"554 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31\"481</font><br><font color=yellow>Skitty-san </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land crs</font> time of 1'36\"697 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'24\"746</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land lap</font> time of 0'11\"220 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'10\"880</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Shy Guy Beach lap</font> time of 0'25\"190 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'17\"986</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'30\"797 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'30\"778</font><br><br>No-Glitch: <br><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano no-glitch lap</font> time of 0'35\"857 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'35\"688</font><br><font color=yellow>AJ Rangthale</font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 Sherbet Land no-glitch crs</font> time of 2'03\"825 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'03\"750</font><br><br><br>These 3 weeks have been pretty mad, the TAS community went ahead and found 3 ultras in 24 hours, we managed to get double digits on the WR counter for the 8th month in a row and most importantly, we have a new #1 meme category. Good job to everyone who improved and a big thank you to Jacob and anyone else who's been adding times and helping the community lately. Cheers and a friendly reminder to everyone to stay hydrated in this weather.<br><br>- Arvo </b></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Hey yall, Arvo here with another news update for all you intellectual meme lovers. This one is dedicated to Jacob Fitzgibbon or Arrow for doing an inhumane amount of snooping to find people's times. Good job and respect to him. Unfortunately due to this I might mess up some minor things with the dates, bare with me. I'm also going to reformat the update a bit, hopefully making it easier to read. Feel free to criticise, but it looks nicer to me.<br><br>We had some good stuff this month, 2/3 on rSL was finally done with magikruiser, which led to a WR cut of almost 7 seconds and the GV glitch WR saga continued - truly one of the greatest WR battles of the modern era of MKW. We might be running out of time for the monthly double digit WRs though, we only have 4 more days to get 2 more WRs. Let's make it happen.<br><br>Let's get into the things that a news update is supposed to talk about though. Those improvements and the statistics. And remember, stats don't care about your feelings.<br><br>This news update covers from July 29th to August 27th 2019<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime>Mickle , Nathan Socholotiuk , Gabe R , Josh Nebeker , Ju Ki , Parker Johnson , Joeey , Thomas Capel (why is he allowed on the site) , Jason Naill </font> <br><br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Justin Hitchcock</font> kept up the grind once again. He asserted dominance over Braixen on Maple Treeway glitch, cutting over 3 seconds over Braixen's former WR with 2 improvements. He also momentarily lost rDS regionals, knocking him back to //only// 47/48. He got them back within a couple of weeks. And if that wasn't enough he got flap WRs on BC3 shortcut and DKM no glitch. Get in there lad.<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font> got in trouble with the Finnish government for not being home to receive a letter and cannot pay rent on time next month. So naturally, he has been playing unhealthy amounts of MKW. I started with choking sub 2 on BC3 shortcut on the last straight, rapidly moved on to choking run after run on CM ng, and went on the best form I've ever had in this game by getting 2 miracle runs on Maple Treeway in 2 days. I also had time to pray for correct inputs for hours on WGM and GV glitches. It's been a fun month.<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Nick Meade</font> has made his mark this month by getting a nice time on GV2 no glitch. Some of his recent missing times was also added by the namesake of this news update.<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Vincent Braixen</font> achieved a solid time on TF as well as subbing 2:13 on DKJP no glitch. Well done, Vincent #1.<br><br><br><font color=red>Ross Coleman (and others)</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Olivier Luyckxckqkqckckcckks</font> also subbed 2:13 on DKJP. Good feat mate, keep it up and please get a better last name in your next life.<br><br><font color=yellow>#16 AJ Rangthale</font> was mostly occupied by his Annoying Orange bingewatching but regardless, he did get a few glitch PRs because of McRaren trying his hardest to bring him down. <br><br><font color=yellow>#21 Ross Coleman</font> is being worked to death by the evil capitalist swines at his local Iceland. Because of the clear oppression and multiple human rights violations, Ross fell into a dark place and started to play the most despicable, disgusting categories this game has to offer as a punishment to himself. Ross decimated the rSL glitch WR after weeks of grinding for 2/3, got GV flap WR after not so long, improved on CM glitch flap and is now playing GV glitch with the TAS entry. Ross, if you read this, please get help.<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Jake Harrison</font> climbed another 4 spots this month with his consistent improvements. He was angry at a certain highway and decided to take out his anger towards rDH. He also got a solid TF time earlier this month. He has also still not stopped the screaming. Please for the love of God stop the screaming. 2.5 AF cut.<br><br><font color=yellow>#30 Aziz Abdullah</font> the legend found some time to play and set a time on Toad's Factory. Glad to see him still going!<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> has been so busy with MKW investigation that he hasn't had time to get as many improvements as he usually does. He has got a few though, cutting a lot of no SC AF but ended up dropping 0.3 on the combined ones. More next month, ye?<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 Dane Allen</font> has unfortunately broke away from the other Dane this month. SAD! He got a new GV2 PR. Fantastic.<br><br><font color=yellow>#41 Timothy Santoro</font> improved his WR but got fried like a shrimp on the barbie just over a week later. Still waiting for a comeback.<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Wilf Lovatt</font> is in the top 50. I repeat. <font color=yellow>#46 Wilf Lovatt</font> is in the top 50. Congratulations you madman. He got 32 improvements and cut over 25 AF. Keep up the grind, top 25 next.<br><br><font color=yellow>#48 Howdy Partner</font> managed to slide his way into this news update by improving 2 days after the last update. I like your style. You can play again now, Hunter.<br><br><br><font color=red>dancingswimmer</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#70 Vincent Nguyen</font> continued his grind for becoming Vincent #1 with 12 PRs, cutting a whopping 20 positions and over 14 AF. Solid.<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#112 Bryce</font> finally joined the cult of AF by finishing his timesheet. Congratulations but you are still a tyrannical dictator of the discord server and we need to spread awareness of your wrongdoings.<br><br><font color=yellow>#118 Logan Tracey</font> improved his DKM ng WR as well as his TF time. nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#128 Idriz</font> got like a thousand PR's, cut 36 AF, climbed 32 positions, changed his discord name 16 times and played rYF on the super blooper. Grats!<br><br><font color=yellow>#135 Indy Kambeitz</font> completed his timesheet. Welcome to the cult. We cherish you.<br><br><font color=yellow>#188 Kenneth Bernales</font> climbed only 4 spots with a AF cut of 8. Surprising. Regardless, great job on the improvements!<br><br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#219 Leon Bisschops</font> 11 PRs, 4 spots, 3.5 AF. Would say he likes maps but I now know that map stands for minor attracted person. Although, the MKW community doesn't have a shortage of those either soooo... (stay safe guys)<br><br><font color=yellow>#223 Neige LDN</font> got 11 PR's, cut 11 AF and climbed 11 spots. What are the odds.<br><br><font color=yellow>#240 Dante Dhillion</font> did actually get a few PRs this month but because Jacob is on steroids, I don't actually know how many. Good job anyway.<br><br><font color=yellow>#242 Aaron Burr</font> is sorry for the ping at 4:30 am but he's looking into buying a cheap capture card and he would like to know which one I use. He also climbed 41 AF and 27 spots with 23 PRs.<br><br><font color=yellow>#256 Jeroen Schepers</font> got some prs or something<br><br><font color=yellow>#272 Parker Johnson</font> got a timesheet or something<br><br><font color=yellow>#273 Darien L</font> got the biggest AF cut of the month once again, cutting over 64 AF and climbing 45 positions or something<br><br><font color=yellow>#300 Max Itzkowitz</font> PR'd on Koopa Cape.<br><br><font color=yellow>#322 Joeey</font> finished his timesheet.

Excellent job, Hitchcock.<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Arvo Koskikallio</font> has been busy default dancing and hiding in bushes this month, but I did get a few PR's aswell. I improved on DKJP glitch, bopping Bryce on the Total Time stat, get destroyed fam. I also got 2 pretty nice subs on GV and MH. Could have been a lot worse.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 David Morton</font> is a filthy hoarder so I'm only going to mention his rMC and MH improvements.

He apparently got a rPB improvement? He wasn't on Jacobs list found times soooooo, maybe?<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Ruby Aruba</font> got a rMC time. Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> got a time on rWS and DKS.

Except you're really not, stop drinking you alcoholic bob ross hair degenerate<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Daddy Gallenberger</font> whipped out the spear and did some glitching on BCWii. Not bad m8<br><br><font color=yellow>#32 Linguini888</font> added times religiously but also drove a few of his own aswell. He improved his rPB glitch flap to 2nd WW, .6 would be sick there. He subbed 1:19 on MC3 and 1:54 on rWS, and improved his old meme rDH glitch time. Keep up the good work Jacob!<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Alex Shoal</font> got ANOTHER improvement on rPG. I heard its for OG's so makes sense. :cool:<br><br><font color=yellow>#35 Wilf Lovatt</font> is some sort of superhuman so he climbed another 11 spots this month and cut 12 AF with 20 PRs. He played non-stop throughout the whole month except for when he attended the Sheffield MorgzFest.<br><br><font color=yellow>#37 Dane Allen</font> got the big 1:50 sub on DDR. <br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Cole Gilbert</font> improved his LC WR by 5 milliseconds, as I mentioned at the start of the update. He's never truly gone.<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#55 Carter Clem</font> climbed 6 positions, making his way closer to the top 50. Way too many improvements to list, but the rYF sub minute must be nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#62 Vincent Nguyen</font> is very unoriginal, he shares his last name with 1/3 of the Vietnamese population.

But before all that he was busy screaming at walls, trees and poles.

Probably went wide around every goomba on the last turn on MG.<br><br><font color=yellow>#151 Alex Bjorkman</font> improved on rDS to make the update. Not bad.<br><br><font color=yellow>#190 Kenneth Bernales</font> still got a few PR's in. Maybe about 30 more next month?<br><br><br><font color=red>200-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#211 Leon Bisschops</font> got a ton of PR's but no huge AF cut like last time.

Because of this, rBC WR history is now almost as screwed up as my life, NMeade WR in 2017, Zane 1000+ day WR and Ruso setting a CTGP run back in 2015 to piss off Thomas who never had the WR because of it.

Crazy stuff from both of you.<br>Luke also finally pulled through with an exceptional run on rMC, reaching a 1:30.612. Still far from what's possible but insane for how difficult it is to be fast here.<br>Sosis also got the .4 on MMM, mad ting<br><br>Also huge shoutout to Kasey for finally getting the first non-Cole sub 1:09 on LC.

A 53.5 on GV2 ng for a player outside of the top 300 is not normal. Potential!<br><br><font color=yellow>#310 Gaetan Charpentier</font> from Argenton-sur-Creuse (has to be the longest name+town combo on the entire PP) unloaded like a hundred PR's and cut 20 positions.

He's surely grinding TF glitch as I'm writing this, the possibility of a new German Record is something he just cannot turn down.<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Ross Coleman</font> made up for last month's lack of stupid glitch categories by being the first one to get a proper TF glitch flap together. It's only fitting. Since his time on TF before the glitch wasn't too special, he was able to get a gigantic AF cut and move all the way up to 12th place. Top 10 soon. He also spent some time on MC glitch after the constant harassment he got for his time there. also he did some spear shit but he does that every month so not gonna talk about that lol<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 AJ Sosis</font> did manage to get KC WW tops in the end. Good job! hey buddy banana you'll move to havana and live in a cabana<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Jake Harrison</font> is playing TF no glitch flap while everyone else is playing glitch, what a rebel. Also got an improvement on rDH no glitch, I can only assume he want's to improve his most prized Canadian top category.<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Stavros Ferentinos</font> improved his MG no-sc time a ton, which helped him achieve his goal of sub 20 no-sc AF this month, big congrats to him! He also defended his score with a KC flap improvement.<br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> was another one who jumped on the TF glitch bandwagon as soon as possible. He managed to cut off a ton of AF with a flap and 3lap improvement, and makes his way into the top 30 for the very first time. Congrats Jacob!  :) A dangerous journey is ahead, however. He is approaching the nearly 8 AF point void between 26th and 27th place. May God be on your side during these difficult times that lay ahead.<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Alex Shoal</font> i think at this point its pretty obvious what he did. WR soon.<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 MKRFirestone</font> has been attempting TF glitch, but so far without a completed time. He did, however get a WGM flap improvement, which earns him a news mention for the first time in a while.<br><br><font color=yellow>#42 Caleb House</font> is becoming a normally functioning human, and playing less and less Mario Kart. The TF glitch discovery was just too much to turn down, though, and he just had to get a time. Because his no-glitch flap was not very well ranked, he somehow climbed 3 positions with that improvement. Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#43 Timothy Santoro</font> is now an army man, which is why he has not been heard from for a while. He did get Christmas off, so he continued where he left off on Rainbow Road, finally getting regionals there. Congrats Phyz, and good luck in your training :cool:<br><br><font color=yellow>#44 Carter Clem</font> didn't get as many improvements this month as he usually does, but he did still manage to grind out some Koopa Cape and climb another 2 positions, securing his top 50 spot even further.<br><br>To see what <font color=yellow>#48 Hunter Wells</font> did, watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTqsMTaURrI\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a><br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#60 Vincent Nguyen</font> got an insane time on LC, just barely missing out from WW tops. Good luck if you decide to go for that! Towards the end of the month he, like many others joined the TF glitch grind. He has got a few really good glitches, wouldn't be surprised if goes big on this one.<br><br><font color=yellow>#64 Indy Kambeitz</font> what the hell how did you cut 25 positions in 1 month inside the top 100 what drugs are you on. Jokes aside, good job on the improvements, the one that sticks out is his new GV no sc Benelux record. Congrats, keep up the grind maatje<br><br><font color=yellow>#82 Bryce</font> seems to be directing his focus on cheesing his way up the BKS individual rankings, managing to TIE THE BKS TOTAL FOR 2 DIFFERENT MG GLITCH METHODS SO HE GETS MORE POINTS ON THE MOST OBSCURE RANKINGS IN THE GAME. He did get a TF glitch flap but since he is terrible at the game (worst WR holder) he didn't even PR on 3lap lol what a clown take the L noob<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#113 Logan BbirbPog</font> got his last name legally changed, but because of him grinding TF glitch for 2 days straight with no sleep, he fell asleep on the keyboard when he had to enter his new last name to the goverment system. Unlucky! Also his newest TF glitch WR was a 1:47.001 with a bounce after the last low. Unlucky!<br><br><font color=yellow>#114 The King of Portugal</font> finally got his timesheet completed. I struggle to understand how you had Portuguese record on every category, but not a complete timesheet. Lazy!<br><br><font color=yellow>#138 Michael Penninck</font> these are probably all old times anyways but still epic<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#153 Shawn Berry</font> returned to TTs briefly, getting the sub 1:48 on DDR. Congrats man, crazy to see how many 1:47s there are today, when it was just Infi for the longest time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#158 Matt Danner</font> made a return to the PP after three and a half years, always great to see a returning player. Welcome back! Also I swear this guy allied for a clan I was in back in 2012<br><br><font color=yellow>#178 Leon Bisschops</font> keeps asking me when I'm gonna do the news update. He grinded a ton of tracks as always, and got especially good at MH. He also got a 53.7 on GV2 no-glitch, very nice! Good luck for next month!<br><br><font color=yellow>#182 Kenneth Bernales</font> returned after no improvements last month and kept pushing down his timesheet. He's getting really close to rMR 1:42 and got a pretty good MC ng time (probably because of NMeade's challenge)<br><br><font color=yellow>#196 Aaron M</font> Not as many improvements as last month, but still quite a few. Thanks for the Best Known Pace video again :)<br><br><font color=yellow>#200 Michael Harmon</font> aka Av Orange posted, what I assume are all his TT improvements over the past 4 years or so. It was just enough to make top 200, but I think the thing he values more than that is his new WGM no glitch PR. Good job man.<br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#210 Jacob Loerzel</font> the rDKJP kid completed his timesheet. Welcome to the rankings.<br><br><font color=yellow>#219 Darien Lupton</font> is still steadily climbing towards the top 200. A very impressive 19 AF cut this month, keep up the grind mate. Also congrats on the WGM glitch 33, it's great to see a grind pay off like that. Straya 4life<br><br><font color=yellow>#247 Jeroen Schepers</font><br><br>JeroenToday at 03:33<br>Sometimes i wish i never wake up<br><br>:(<br>Congrats on the improvements, hope you wake up to see this<br><br><font color=yellow>#285 Bradon</font> improved on rBC to get a mention. Strategic.<br><br><font color=yellow>#295 Gaetan Charpentier</font> the beast from Argenton-sur-Creuse cut another 27 AF this month, climbing up to the top 300. Good job, keep it up fam<br><br><font color=yellow>#330 Kaiser Virtuoso</font> did finally gain the title for biggest AF cut of the month (just over 57 AF cut). Congrats man, keep doing what you're doing, seeing some activity from you on the forums has been great.<br><br><font color=yellow>#430 Dan Lewis</font> didn't get as big of a cut this month, but he did still cut off 9 positions. Keep it up man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#447 Vincent Kwiecien</font> made a comeback after 3 years of no improvements. Great to see that, we now have 4 active Vincent's that TT. Now all we need is for <font color=yellow>#347 Vincent Zee</font> to make a comeback, but seeing as he hasn't improved since 2009, I doubt that's going to happen.<br><br><font color=yellow>#451 Joel Johnson</font> got a few improvements including his new highest rank time, CM glitch flap 5.013 (#69) nice<br><br><font color=yellow>#475 James Woods</font> is gutted because Labor had a disaster in the UK election. He had a lot of times of his own this month (automatic, of course) but he's made some infamous remarks on discord that I'd like to highlight:<br><br>- \"Isn't juice wrld a former DKS WR holder?\"<br>- \"What I mean is Bynt is now as good as Troy at MKW imo\"<br>- \"This guy Shaun is possibly one of the greatest TTers rn but has no WW tops. He’s never talked about\"<br>- \"Just don’t talk to me about Manual and we’ll get along. Ok\"<br>- \"I mean LC 200cc is the second most played CTGP category but nothing is said about it\"<br>- \"It hurts me that 200cc rSL is still 1/3 Glitch. If only 200cc was appreciated on tts, a skilled player could get 2/3 in a day\"<br>- \"A 15.8 flap on LC 200cc is probably my best achievement\"<br>- \"Arvo i switched to manual icymi\"<br><br><font color=yellow>#476 Buzzy \"I am not a furry\" Wuzzy</font> couldn't match the crazy AF cut that he got last month, but he still got a ton of improvements. Nice!<br><br><font color=yellow>#570 Paul Allain</font> completed his timesheet and joins some of the all time greats at the bottom of the rankings. Couldn't quite match the feats of such legends as <font color=yellow>#571 Peter Ferguson</font> or the reigning reverse champion <font color=yellow>#572 Claire March</font>. hahaha women cant drive epic funny<br><br><br>Site Records:<br><br><font color=yellow>Logan BbirbPog </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'49\"326 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'47\"001</font><br><font color=yellow>Arvo Koskikallio </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory lap</font> time of 0'34\"881 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'32\"396</font> (suck it ross)<br><font color=yellow>McRaren </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 0'32\"351 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'32\"322</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> time of 2'18\"255 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'17\"990</font><br><font color=yellow>David899 </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills crs</font> time of 1'31\"759 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'31\"539</font><br><br><br>Thanks to TF glitch, we again, got more than 10 WRs this month.

One of these days he won't choke and get the dream ending with a DK low and kill that category for good. Then he will cry because I will have gotten the first 31 glitch flap which is the more important category.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Oliver Luyckx (pronounced [l�\"y̯k(s)])</font> has been on a mad Luigi Circuit grind, reaching 7th WW and raising the Belgian flag to international glory with pride and determination.<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 AJ Sosis</font> is pushing rDH to a level beyond my understanding. He could actually get the WR without a single wheeliecut which is just so insane. Good luck man, learn wheeliecut and 1:33 is yours. KNIFE!<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Jake Harrison</font>, you are nothing. The fact that you even entertain the idea of being able to outclass me in this game is laughable. You will never know what it meant to be on top of the flap competition. It's interesting how something so casual and easy proves to be such a challenge for unskilled players such as yourself. <br><br>This run was the result of 15 minutes of attempts on 0 sleep.

Goodnight.<br><br>He got PRs on KC and rMR and a bad time on TF ng flap.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Ruby Aruba</font> got a KC PR at the start of the month, back when it was still trendy to play KC. Sadly those times seem to be gone, as MKW overlord Luke has moved to rBC.<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Stavros Ferentinos</font> and I had a very sophisticated conversation about communism yesterday (stay mad ross). Before that lifechanging event he did manage to get PRs on KC (again, back when it was trendy) and avoided the .420 digits on rDH masterfully to show that drugs have no place in a healthy and happy society.<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> has been sending me interesting MKW statistical facts for the entire month, which I am very thankful for. Jacob has been at work on verious flaps, which is very typical of him. He also clutched out a great time on WGM glitch and also got a time on TF glitch. (at least its better than what bryce got LOL)<br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Danny Gallenburger</font> shut up your a burger<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Dane Allen</font> got pretty slick rBC3 ng and WGM glitch times this month, as well as an abundance of flap improvements. Good one big man Thunder1721<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 MKRFirestone</font> got a 1:55 on DDR and a 1:59 on CM. Quick reminder that this man was a long-time WR holder.<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Carter Clem</font> has been trackhopping quite a bit this month, still being able to push rBC to a pretty impressive 2:32.1. He also hit me up asking for advice on the rYF bridge stick, and I'm pretty sure he's beginning to understand that there is no method to that madness.<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#56 Indy Kambeitz</font> just doesn't stop climbing the ranks, cutting over 12 AF this month with another 22 improvements. Getting closer and closer to the top 50 dude, you'll get there soon.<br><br><font color=yellow>#58 Filler</font> made a return to the game in time for 2020, surprising the MKW world with a 2nd WW time on rBC. He followed that up with rSGB and MC improvements. Maybe some day he will start using his name again.<br><br><font color=yellow>#61 Vincent Nguyen</font> has been abandoning the trackhopping strategy and moved on to grinding almost exclusively TF. I know how it feels. Congrats on the glitch WW tops!<br><br><font color=yellow>#74 Bryce</font> has been very angry and is soon getting banned from twitter for excessive spamming. He got the worst time I've ever seen on TF glitch lol and has all around been very terrible at this game as of late lmao get good idiot moron<br><br><font color=yellow>#99 Kasper</font> made a return to TTs, getting times on rYF (59.6 with BB, woah), DKS and BC3. Great to see!<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#101 Benjamin Zenon</font> also came back to TTs and remembered what a terrible track MMM is, I don't know why he kept on playing it. He also struggled with the new CTGP rules outside of the PP and was giving me severe PTSD from trying to arrange clan wars with French people . <br><br><font color=yellow>#109 Logan BbirbPog</font> got the first ever 2/3 on TF glitch and is by his own words \"never playing this again\". Let's see if he holds on to that promise. He also made a mockery of everyone on rDH and doing the glitch recovery very fast, getting the WR after a short grind.<br><br><font color=yellow>#134 Daseia</font> took a quick break from CTWWs and decided to joined the PP. He also started quite possibly the biggest category drama by beating Blaze's MG ng WR with the wallride, great job idiot! bruh is better than daisy squad and I$<br><br><font color=yellow>#150 Matt Danner</font> unloaded another batch of times onto the PP during one week. Keep doing what you're doing fam<br><br><font color=yellow>#155 Shawn Berry</font> joined the rMR bandwagon, getting the 1:41 there along with so many others. Y'all make it look so damn easy.<br><br><font color=yellow>#157 Blake Germany</font> made quite possibly the most surprising return of the last few years, reclaiming his throne on DKS. Knowing how much he enjoys memes the majority of the community believed it to be a troll but it was actually real, well done man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#172 Leon Bisschops</font> pulled, big W. He also completed MKW advanced training with a 1:09 on LC, I feel like that time is starting to be the defining sub grind at the start of people's TT journey. He also got some other times but LC was the big one.<br><br><font color=yellow>#176 Chaos</font> started his journey to overtaking his namesake <font color=yellow>#118 Andrew Grieve</font> by completing his timesheet. Good luck in becoming the #1 chaos on the PP.<br><br><font color=yellow>#184 Kenneth Bernales</font> grinded out a 2:07 on DKM no glitch. Incredible job man, that track is not a friendly one to get into.<br><br><font color=yellow>#185 Blahpy</font> improved for the first time in almost 8 years, getting an mega epic 2:04.8 on rSL glitch as well as glitch flaps on both rSL and rPB.<br><br><font color=yellow>#192 Aaron M</font> played various flaps and got a nice omega on rSL ng flap.<br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#205 That DKJP kid</font> finally pulled through on his track, getting a 3/3 run and 6th WW.

Improvements were added on BCWii, DKS and rMR, but those might all be older PRs. Still, this man is gonna be on top for absolute ages, he can focus on more generate things without worrying about the PP.<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Arvo Koskikallio</font> claims his place at number Arsenal FC on the PP. Really damn happy to finally escape 5th place after over a year of being stuck in a void. After grinding TF for close to a month I decided to AF grind like hell, managed to cut almost 2 whole points and bopped Totom. 1:48 on DDR is in the horizon for me but I've been too busy posting cringe content on discord to get it.<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Vincent Braixen</font> improved on his own CM WR but it still stands at a 1:55.7 unfortunately. I'm sure we'll see a really insane run from him soon. He also played a couple other tracks like LC (targetting sword...) and rDH glitch (he got a 1:31 on there, god damn)<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Zed R</font> tried to pull through on WGM glitch but WGMG is a patience test and he hasn't completed it yet. After this he moved on to better things like rMR and DDR which seem to treat him a little better. <br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Nick Meade</font> got taken over by the German but focused on rBC and pulled through with 2nd WW there, Incredible (Video) Nick! 2:30 will happen.<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Ross Coleman</font> is streaming RR glitch right now and I'm using the news update as an excuse to not watch that garbage. He finally got the TF WR after stalling but the superior player always wins in the end... He did however get WW tops on MG with the spear wow look at me im so quirky i dont like mainstream combos dont hit on me silly kids<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 AJ Rangthale (hey you got your name back!)</font> came back to MKW after going MIA for a while. It's ok, rDH has broken many men before you. The WR is right there, let's hope he can clutch out a sick run, that track has so much left in it. He has put a lot of focus on the PP on the past couple of days, climbing 4 spots with 3lap grinds, glitches and flaps. Top 10 combined/Top 3 No-SC soon.<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Jake Harrison</font> climbed more spots again, he never stops. He got the 9th TF glitch run that beats the WR and subbed 1:36 on rDH with THEGADTIME (Jordan is jealous) <br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> enters the top 25 on the combined ranks, bye bye Aruba! He did this by grinding terrible tracks and 2 of the worst flaps in the game (DKS and rDH). Good job comrade!<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> tortures himself with rSL glitch 2/3 and is stuck in a huge AF void, not fun.

This grind has been going on for so god damn long, it will all be worth it in the end I'm sure.<br><br><font color=yellow>#38 Carter Clem</font> continues his ascent on the charts by playing a ton of different times, trackhopping 4life brother<br><br><font color=yellow>#43 Caleb House</font> made another return to grinding spear tracks, LC this time. He's very close to being the 10th person to get a .1 on LC, only 2 ms to go. LC tops are getting insane, awesome to see everyone push that track to it's limits. Cole needs some company.<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#52 Indy Kambeitz</font> is slowly but surely making his way into the top 50, passing such legends as Tschuki and Jimmy B this month. Bopping WiiLord95 seems inevitable, we need a surprise comeback to prevent this from happening. Jokes aside, good going maatje<br><br><font color=yellow>#58 Vincent Nguyen</font> has utterly abandoned his trusted trackhopping strategy and has grinded rBC for a long time instead. He did however post an LC flap time so he might be making a return to AF grinding. Only time will tell.<br><br><font color=yellow>#59 Filler</font> did not decide to lose the mask and decided to keep his real identity a mystery. The man has shown interest in AF grinding so I bet we can expect a lot of fast progress from him soon. He is also getting really close to being the 3rd person to sub 1:09 on LC which is just god damn insane. Also he keeps getting MC3 PR's with bad l1s. Never Restart.<br><br><font color=yellow>#64 Bryce</font> Keeps asking for his monthly AF cut so here we go: It's -4.0000 this month! He also got a 2/3 glitch run on rSL getting him 2nd worldwide, and being the 4th person to get a 2/3 run. This got him a large lead on the total time stat, which he has used to torment me every day for a week.<br><br><font color=yellow>#99 JMM435</font> got a TF glitch flap which skyrocketed him to the top 100, absolutely mad. He unfortunately lost one Portuguese CR and has been too depressed to play after this traumatic event.

Can we play CTWWs some day I want to troll you on Rainbow Road lunar edition and get disconnected again<br><br><font color=yellow>#118 Andrew Grieve</font> made an incredible comeback this month, did not expect that to happen. He got WW tops back on DKS which was insane. Jimmy cut op, hope to see more from you, Chaos!<br><br><font color=yellow>#127 Tom Norton</font> has been grinding LC and playing better while tipsy, I will never understand how people do this. We had an interesting conversation on stream and I have been branded as a degen shitposter by the Sw0rd0fSeals himself. I accept the title with pleasure and continue to shitpost all over the news updates every month from now on! But for real, hope you push through on LC and can have nice and healthy sessions.<br><br><font color=yellow>#155 Shawn Berry</font> kept going with rMR, pushing his time to a low .6 there. Good shit dude<br><br>Searching for February times from <font color=yellow>#157 Fake Chaos</font> gave me 69 results. Nice. Also there's no way I'm listing all of them so I'm just gonna just say 26.7 AF cut which is pretty huge. He also made the OG chaos come back because he was scared of being the #2 Chaos on the PP, you're an inspiration!<br><br><font color=yellow>#170 Leon Bisschops</font> is gonna get coronavirus rip leon :( He did improve his GV BNL tops time and getting closer to the epicness border which is officially set at the 1:54.999 mark. He is also well on his way to being over 8 feet tall, Dutch genes are not fair.<br><br><font color=yellow>#182 Aaron M</font> got some prs and gained 10 positions ay<br><br><font color=yellow>#199 That DKJP kid</font> reached the holy top 200 what a legend<br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#216 Darien Lupton</font> improved his WGM glitch time again, absolute champion<br><br><font color=yellow>#217 Kjeld van Keulen</font>'s timesheet is probably the weirdest thing I've seen on the PP, half of the times are from December 2009, half were just set February 2020.

He climbed 6 spots this month, overtaking some legends like <font color=yellow>#238 Justin Best</font>.<br><br><font color=yellow>#243 Connor GB</font> keeps tweeting and I always see Luton FC when I open twitter, we need to do sumtin about this.

Due to us having to learn to use the parser there might be a few mistakes in time updates, despite our attempts to avoid them. Please point out our fuckups. Thank you.<br><br>OK now that that's over with. Last time I did this update I was worrying about waking up in time for exams. Now, 3 weeks later I haven't left my house for more than 10 minutes at a time. My sleep schedule is so fucked that it's actually slowly turning back into a regular sleep schedule, just 24 hours later than normal. The world is fallen into a state of utter degeneracy and this has, naturally, increased MKW activity yay!! <br><br>Stay safe out there and avoid IRL interaction.

He did however get motivated by a man simply named DOGE to improve his DKJP flap. His rDH ng flap also got backrolled due to him using the banned ending strat (Whether or not that should be banned is a potential discussion to be had, but not this news update) so he improved that to a time that's very close to his old time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Thomas van Deerse</font> played some flaps for presumably AF related reasons. He's holding his ground like a champ and not going down without a fight. He should be able to maintain his 3rd place for a while if he plays this right things (hint hint TF glitch MG glitch).<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Arvo Koskikallio</font> only improves flaps. I finally got DDR 1:48 after over a month of playing on and off with an extremely anticlimactic run. I moved on from that to DKM, where I crushed my old flaps and got close to glitch flap WR, but didn't quite beat Logan the DKM goat. Oh yeah and I also slammed into a tree for over 10 hours for an MC glitch flap.<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Vincent Braixen</font> has been playing in the shadows, I haven't heard a single thing from him and now he suddenly has 1:58 on BC3 what. Also he bopped me off rDH glitch flap tops, unacceptable. Jokes aside, good job man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 AJ Rangthale</font> makes it into the top 10 for the first time. He conquered his fear of stupid categories and played some glitches, flaps and inconsistent garbage tracks. He also got the rDH ng WR after already giving up once and then picking it up again. Persistence.

I know how it feels, get well soon.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Oliver Luyckx</font> did what he usually does and came out of nowhere with an insane time, it was 1:47 on DKS this time. His run, iirc, was 2/3 jimmy with a 36.8 l3 so there is definitely potential for much more. It's crazy how nobody has got 1:46 in ages and the top 3 is just chilling in their own dimension on that track.<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Jake Harrison</font> got a couple of PRs and is slowly but surely ascending the rankings.

He now has WW tops on 4 out of the 6 spear tracks (Although Ross would probably say there are over 16 spear tracks in MKW).<br><br><font color=yellow>#48 Indy Kambeitz</font> got 17 PR's this month, bopping WiiLord95, the god of MKW in the process.

He also finally got the sub 21 on MG (20.5 :O) after a long and painful grind. Massive congrats, crazy stuff.<br><br><font color=yellow>#95 JMM435</font> returned to his natural ways of improving his Portuguese records.

Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#129 Tom Norton</font> continued to broadcast his mental breakdowns to the tune of Luigi Circuit. He overcame the track and got a solid 6th WW time there.

Penev came back with a bang to make edits to the site, we now have 3lap only no glitch AF charts for all our glitchphobic and flapaphobic comrades and, more interestingly we can now link videos to times! We are truly living in the future. <br><br>However, adding videos is extremely time-consuming for existing times, they need to be resubmitted into the database with the video attached to them. If anyone is interested in helping out, you can submit existing times and add videos. The times don't have to be your own, as long as you enter the right date and use the right format, I can just run the parser and go through them very fast. (Having videos for WRs would be awesome, for example) Help out if you want, it will be much appreciated.<br><br><br>Ok now that I've tried to make the community do the work that I'm supposed to be doing lets actually write the news update<br><br><br><br>So what happened this month? Well, quite a lot I think. <br><br>Firstly, we got 17 WRs so far thanks to quarantine MKW, stay inside and nolife TTs to save the world boys<br><br>Amaya's large wallet started a Rainbow Road glitch bounty which is currently at $465 for the 3lap WR. The longer it takes the higher the chances are that people are going to disappear and not pay up. So hurry gamers.<br><br>The community collectively ganged up on Blaze for not providing sufficient proof and we peer pressured him to share his BKS' (GV2 excluded because the track is too scary for Blaze). Blaze did redeem himself by getting a WR on MG but his Wii U was unfortunately denied access to the CTGP database by the isolationist Idahoan regime. He also got bulldozed by LUKE-GB-2000 shortly after, F's in the chat<br><br>TroyWD gave Eminem the D??? Why is everyone talking about this? Slim Shady is not even real he is just a character played by Marshall Mathers (eminems real name) so what people are saying???<br><br>rDH 1:30, MG 1:40 and GV 15 are all getting closer and closer to becoming reality, we live in a crazy world<br><br>BIG CHEESE MISSED DKM SUB 2 NO<br><br>And the big surprise of the month, the absolute legend SpitFire aka FMSD Cole redeemed himself after over 4 years and came back with a new DKM glitch PR on CTGP. This makes his old pending time valid, making him a former WR holder and adding salt to TWD's wounds.<br><br><br>Quote of the month:<br><br>You have to pull through the shit sessions, that's what makes or breaks the gamer.<br>- //Ross Coleman//<br><br><br>Also Bynt asked me to talk about his inspirational rPB 1:12 grind in the news update but I'm gonna say he sucks at Sunset Forest instead LMAO get owned kid<br><br><br>ok i think i angered quite a few people there so lets stop writing and do some stats<br><br><br>This news update covers from April 1st 2020 to April 30th 2020 although the stats program is 2 days behind so im gonna fail to mention some stuff GGs<br><br><br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime><br>Railz (the letter Z in your username is like wearing eyeliner IRL)<br>Nathan Brammer (Replaces Flamin Funky as the #1 Nathan of the community after Nate was gunned down by Bryce and the youtube-mp4 gang)<br>Mitchell Healy (I hate that Gru profile picture)<br>ZappZ (Two letter Z's in your username is like injecting eyeliner into your bloodstream, Trump is considering this as a cure to COVID-19)<br>Simon Dube (is it pronunced Dube or Dubé)<br>C.J.

Starting off on MC he got 3rd WW on ng and 4th on g. He also joined Caleb in the 24flap gang, very nice. Towards the end of the month he played rWS, knocking off my boy Jawdyn (irrelevant player) from the tops. He played MG ng, getting very close to WR. We'll see what this madman does next month.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Martin Fox</font>. I haven't been able to write that name since I took over, but this month he decided to drop Shifty Shafts and bounce off a few pipes to reclaim his treasured Nordic Record (most relevant record in MKW). Hope you're enjoying default dancing on your opponents in mogi.<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Calvo Koskikallio</font>'s sleep schedule is 48 hours ahead god damnit. I finished my DKM grind reaching all my goals there and the proceeded to only improve flaps for the rest of the month. MH PR is on the way though. I'm getting closer to #3 and waking up Thomas from his hibernation. Also not being able to get a haircut started getting annoying so I had a few beers and now I look like Bateson87.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 Vincent Braixen</font> cut like a thousand AF this month and made me look stupid in front of my friends again. I called him bad on rDH flap and got decimated. Fuck. He got to hold WR on rDH for a while but everyone's been playing that so it didn't last very long. Despite his loss I heard he's doing well, corona hasn't affected him much since he's very accustomed to staying home to do schoolworkHAHAHAHAHA im so sorry i had to<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Ejay B</font> returned to rDH inspired by his amazing treeclip discovery a few months prior. He managed to reclaim WR there but ended up getting involved in a global conflict against the Yankee Doodle gang which ended up in Braixen swooping the WR, David struck back hard with a lucky glitch run, sadly he thought that drifting after the glitch would be slower, this misjudgement lost him a lot of time, but he still managed to clutch out a big WR cut. Unfortunately the Yanks followed back with another successful strike from Glitch O, which forced David to move on to GV2, getting a 52.8 there with a clutch lap 3. Luckily for David however, Logan is once again stalling the sub and David has a chance to strike again at a later date. Oh yeah and he got 2 rYF WRs aswell but rDH was more exiting to talk about<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 AJ Rangthale</font> has been chillin and grinding away, he started off the month with a bang, with a 1:09.050 on LC, a third 1:08 is on the way, could it be big Sosis who gets it? Lately he's needed a breather from the monotony of spear and moved over to rWS for some action. He's at a .0 there aswell, very close to the big 1:49. Will he prosper? Will he crumble? Yes.<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Ross Coleman</font> in classic Ross Coleman fashion has not set a PR with any other vehicle than the spear this month. He's set PR's on rSGB, rPG and of course MG, the #1 spear track in MKW. He's also been spending his afternoons trying to acquire money by trying to fly in space and avoid the evil cloud man with a U-turn sign like the greedy capitalist he is. GV glitch has also been a recent addition to his roster of tracks since you get to play with a child on that one.<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Jake Harrison</font> has been a little quiet this month but apparently he set a time on MG no glitch today! Hope you're doing well dude, keep up the essential worker routine and dodge the COVID dudes<br><br><font color=yellow>#19 Wincent Nguyen</font> has been playing a lot of amazing categories such as rSGB glitch flap and CM glitch flap which I'm now going to leak my reaction to:<br><br>Arvo25/04/2020<br>lkjdsaLUJHFSDAOJKFHBFKGL<br>:angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry: :angry:<br><br>He cut another 15 AF and keeps climbing the charts like a beast and strikes fear in the heart of every gamer. <br>He will beat you.

Truly terrifying.<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> was in a personal journey through this month, trying to find his place to belong. After a lot of moving around and achieving many things here and there he finally found his place on an active war zone atoll called Shy Guy Beach. Even though the Shy Guys try their best to slow him down he is determined to overcome his curse and hit that 1:21. Good luck yankee doodle gang member.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 JoshuaMK</font> avoided his mother's rule and sneaked away to play MKW for once, setting new times on LC 3lap and flap. He will forever be remembered as the pioneer who implemented LC ramp into the flaps at a high level. Sadly he had to go on a spontanious road trip again and we haven't heard from him since. I hope you're somewhere out there, Mr. MK.<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#29 Dane Allen</font> has beaten the current record of N-words uttered in an online race, his current record being 174 N-words. Congratulations on your achievement, the grind has been wild. The former record was 148 by TWD98, lasting a mind-boggling 6,806 days. he also played flaps or something and got 1:41 on mg but the N-word record was the main thing he was hyped for this month.<br><br><font color=yellow>#30 Daseia</font> provoked another wiimmfi gang war against GUN gang by forgetting to not pick Toad's Factory 10 times in a row by total accident. Also he destroyed everyone's AF gain by cutting off more than 120 AF in one month what the fuck daseia. He casually enters top 30.

I'm pretty sure he'd like to go outside like most of us though, but az it iz I think we need to wait this out.<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 Alex Shoal</font> has FINALLY pulled through on rPG after all these months of slow and painful grinding. The mental block is gone, so he set another 2 WR's very soon after the first one. Amazing job dude, good luck if you decide to push even further.<br><br><font color=yellow>#37 MKRFirestone</font> makes another appearance on the racetrack, sponsored by his favourite tyre company as always. The tracks of the month for him were BCWii and DKS, getting impressive improvements in both tracks. Even when his home circuit has been invaded by the droids, he still pushes on, never forgetting his roots. Inspirational.<br><br><font color=yellow>#39 Carter Clem</font> played some good old LC to start, and then did what he always does, trackhopping around and getting runs. This month he didn't climb any spots because of Daseia but he maintained the top 40. Good job and good luck for next month.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2F 4c756b652042726f776e</font> has been grinding away on Mushroom Gorge and has been maintaining a very chill stream atmosphere this month, very enjoyable lockdown viewing. His goal is now a 1:40 which is just insane. Another insane time he got was a 1:09.443 on LC with the Bowser Bike, just destroying the alternative tops and making Jeff and Liam look like a bunch of fools. His best splits give a 1:09.2. With the Bowser Bike. What.<br><br><font color=yellow>#49 Indy Kambeitz</font> was too busy worshipping ducks and lost a spot on the rankings thanks to Daseia. He played WGM and MT glitches for a while but has gone back into his duck monastery to pray to Lord Daffy, the emperor of all ducks.

He overtook the lord WiiLord95, an act that is extremely frowned upon in most civilized societies. This may have been in retaliation to Jaxon's blatant plagiarism of Bryces Flamin Funky montage, so there is a motive, no matter how flimsy. Bottom line, this is unacceptable.<br><br><font color=yellow>#57 Filler</font>'s disc decided to die which forced him to play on ISO. Playing off CTGP seemed to work out for him, and his activity has severely decreased once he started playing on CTGP again. Hmmmmmmmm. Where have we seen this before???? If only we would know his true identity so we could accuse him of cheating. Truly a shame that we still don't know who this mysterious player is...<br><br><font color=yellow>#72 Lachlan Young</font> the Qnt star entered the time trialing scene once again (or more likely played a bit before a war to practice) with a new PR on Moonview Highway.

Keep wheelwiding and stay blessed.<br><br><font color=yellow>#86 Takeo</font> aka DOGE the wheeling badass completed his timesheet, hopping straight into the top 100. Cool shit DOGE<br><br><font color=yellow>#91 JMM435</font> clips objects and plays flaps. And he was all out of flaps. He got a very glitch reliant rSL run (because he's slow at driving the course) and foolishly attempted to claim the MC glitch European Record from the hands of Ethan Hedley. This did not end well, since Ethan sensed his flawlessly driven ER being threatened and easily blew JMM away. Fun fact: JMM's favourite book is Fifty Shades of Gray thanks to it perfectly describing his view on things.<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#103 Kasper</font> made a return to the Player's Page website after some absence to find that all his times were already added. Jacob Fitzgibbon strikes again. He set some new times on TF and rDS and submitted them himself this time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#105 Logan BbirbPog</font> made a very distasteful video for his new WR, how could anyone think that it would be ok to just make fun of people like that? Truly disgusting, hopefully you learn to not make these hurtful jokes about your fellow racers in the future. He set some PR's but only WRs matter so he got 1 on rDH and 2 on WGM nice job Logan BbirbPog<br>Also Troy and Sadie roasting stream was very enjoyable thank you very much bam, shock dodge bam, shock dodge<br><br><font color=yellow>#108 Shane Hogan</font> unloaded a hundred PRs onto the rankings ok thanks<br><br><font color=yellow>#127 Chaos</font> is so close to the #1 Chaos, you can do it mate.

She completed her basic MKW training with a 1:10 sub on LC. Great job!

With Liam playing MH the WR there is surely going to fall soon. (Just fuck him 2.0?) He also casually made DKJP 3/3 and then improved it on the same day, that the hell Justin. He was also the first one to implement the new DKJP flap shroomstrat in a WR. The shroom was originally found by Idriz I think. (and he also got MG WR but that was on April 30th after I already wrote the last news update so it doesn't count i am so sorry)<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Bald Martin Fox</font> improved on MG ng much like everyone else. That track is getting so optimized now.<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Arvo Koskikallio</font> has been too busy shitposting on twitter to actually grind stuff. I got some PRs on rDS and grinded DKJP flaps for a bit and improved on MH at the start of the month. Getting 3rd place was great and all but the highlight of my month was to finally beat/tie all of WiiLord95's times with improving CM glitch so I could make a tribute video. GG<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Thomas van Deerse</font> came back for the DKJP flap strat, dude makes it look so easy. Great job!<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 Vincent Braixen</font> started the month with some AF grinding but eventually moved on to focusing more on CM ng, getting himself one WR there. There's definitely more to push out of that track, keep up the grind man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Mavid Dorton</font> has been spending the entire month bullying ThomasUK on his lack of 58 second times on rYF. This all backfired on him though, he has been choking a lot of insane rYF runs ever since. He did however get some other nice times, 3rd WW on MC being the big one. Moral of the story: Thomas sucks at rYF LOL<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Apple Jay Rangthale</font> woke up his parents by screaming at Jared's BCWii WR and is not going to sleep tonight. What a madman. He's been AF grinding a bit on his weaker times, launching him to 8th place. He did get some really good stuff though, like 3rd WW on rBC as well as the big 1:49 on rWS. He also managed to get Pakistanian record on BCWii which was very thrilling to see. Good job Sosis!<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Nick Meade</font> has been going in on DKS and CM glitch, securing himself in the top 10 for a while longer. He's also very cowardly and refuses to say Wheel3232 on his streams. We should not be paying him any money for this, it's truly disgraceful... OK in all honesty keep up the good shit man, you're doing god's work with the vids.<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Zed R</font> retired from MKW but still managed to improve on rBC. You should not be playing this game so I'm afraid that is going to earn you a 1. Warning.<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Party Ross Coleman</font> has finally admitted his existence as an inferior being to the god arthur pease. He tried his absolute hardest on WGM to reach his level but his pathetic attempts of matching arthur were in vein, as he got absolutely nowhere near his level. Ross has also been grinding rSL 2/3 to reclaim his WR but he's not quite got it yet. It'll happen soon brotha. He also almost killed himself by playing DKJP flap with the new strats but he somehow lived to tell the tale. Best of luck in recovering from this traumatic experience.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Vincent Nguyen</font> climbed another 5 spots this month, this dude's gonna be top 10 soon at this rate. He did AF grinding managing to get a 1:31 on rMC as well as the CM glitch 33 as well as a lot of other times. <br><br><font color=yellow>#15 Daseia</font> got another 36 PRs and climbing 15 positions this month. What the hell man how do you do this. He hasn't played for a couple of weeks, being too busy playing CTWWs. Enjoy shitting on noobs <br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Jake Harrison</font> has been fighting over 2nd Canadian with The Canadian Cripple for a while, finally getting sub 1:42 there losing to me by .001 :D :D :D. then he started trackhopping around and bopped 2 people on the AF charts. nice nice my nostalgia-loving comrade<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 Oliver L.</font> hopped on MKW again, getting himself a 1:50 on rWS and a 2:17 on MT. Hope to see more from you soon, you always seem to come out of nowhere with crazy times.<br><br><font color=yellow>#21 Liam Ashcroft</font> has, thanks to COVID, been directing his alpha male energy to Moonview Highway instead of gym. He got extremely close to WR there but the final stretch is always the hardest. He also got L1 bks that was unfortunately KIA during a mass ghost deletion and the ghost never found it's way onto the CTGP database. Dennis Colvin 2.0????<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 MKRFirestone</font> has been on the grind for making the hard glitches, which has cut him a lot of AF in the process. He even managed to get a SGB glitch flap, what a legend. GL on all further runs man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> the absolute legend managed to get rPB WR back, but unfortunately narrowly missed the legendary minute sub. The race to sub 1 is on, this might be the last minute sub on MKW. Me and Ross already peer pressured Jacob to use Lucky Soul - Lips Are Unhappy as the bgm in case he gets it. If someone else gets it but doesn't use that song I'm going to cry myself to sleep for a week. Jacob also got the 1:21 on rSGB after many years of being stuck at .0, amazing stuff this month mate :)<br><br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Stavros Ferentinos</font> played some rWS this month aswell, he did have a really nice pace until he decided to hit the mud at the end of l3. He got a pretty good low 1:50 after that though, maybe 1:49 soon? Regardless epic stuff man<br><br><font color=yellow>#31 Dane Allen</font> got a 1:48 on DDR and viciously called me out with this statement:<br>Thunder1721: imagine tting all day every day and still having a worse time than someone who never tts lmfao what a billybob rofl xd<br><br>Brutality. I'm currently crying lukegb style.<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Aziz Abdullah</font> got a nice improvement on DDR but his main focus on mkw was to create a custom track?? The track looks really fun to play aswell, I hope it gets added to CTGP one day :) It might need some visual changes but gameplay-wise it looks really fun and unique.<br><br><font color=yellow>#37 Carter Clem</font> got a couple of flap PBs and a CM glitch improvement at the start of the month but hasn't done anything since. Hope you're doing well man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#38 Alex Shoal</font> got the .0 on rPG, getting closer to Brett's illegal pause time, sub 1:59 might happen some day in the future which is just insane. Good job regardless of whether or not you want to keep pushing or not man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#42 Timothy Santoro</font> has been trying to learn TF box clip on his stream, getting a few nice looking glitches. Unfortunately he hasn't managed to finish a run yet but it's bound to happen soon at this point. He also tied Hunter on MT glitch, gaining him a tied 10th USA placement. Proud American!<br><br><font color=yellow>#44 Luke Brown</font> has been going in on MG and also started getting really sick laps on rDS so quickly, BKS could realistically be pushed to 2:03 now which sounds crazy. He also did some AF grinding, getting a first try 4.3 CM glitch flap, how. Unfortunately though, Luke was exposed by Colin The Mega Mushroom for using controller modifications so all his runs are now invalid that is so very unfortunate... <br><br><font color=yellow>#45 Trung Qatar</font> was suspected of being an alt for so many years but he resurfaced in the German community recently and joined the PP. His times were crazy good for his time, glad to see him finally make contact with the community and maybe make a comeback on CTGP??  ;)<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Hunter Wells</font> posted a very disturbing image of a chicken in a TT server which I can't stop seeing in my brain every time I see Hunter speak why man. Let's get through this quick, Hunter improved some of his weaker times but also got a 37 flap on BC3 sc and a 2:17 3lap on no-sc. He's currently going for 1:58 on sc, good luck cowboy!<br><br><font color=yellow>#50 Indy Kambeitz</font> is hanging onto top 50 until last breath. He improved on TF and then a ton of no-sc categories so the stats program only shows one improvement. Bruh. He is not 40th on the red charts so it was probably worth.<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#53 Cole Gilbert</font>'s insane rPB comeback shook the whole community, how the hell did you skip .8 and went straight to .7???? Cole said he's also got plans to grind rPB to maybe even .6, which would be incredible to see. Good luck Cole, you've got it takes.<br><br><font color=yellow>#56 Bryce</font> has been grinding very hard for DKJP glitch WR, failing tons of really good runs on the 3rd glitch. That has to go down soon with Bryce (and the Duck Squad children) grinding it. He also got the flap BKT on DKJP but he wasnt really trying tho :blush:<br>Oh yeah and he found the nosc flap shroomspot, thanks for the 2 day flap BKT mate<br><br><font color=yellow>#61 JMM435</font> went on a bit of a tear, improving his GV glitch time as well as getting a 2/3 on DKJP with orgasmic digits. Speaking of orgasmic digits he also got a 53.000 on GV2 glitch. How do you do this man that is so cool. Oh yeah and he also climbed 30 spots on the rankings what the hell epic, top 50 soon??<br><br><font color=yellow>#65 Takeo</font> has been trackhopping again and cut 21 positions from last month. He's been entertaining me with PR lore on the time updating thread and also got a 36 on WGM glitch today, nice job DOGE!<br><br><font color=yellow>#71 Lachlan Young</font> got 2:12 on BCWii glitch, grats man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#87 Kasper</font> is very close to reaching his goal of beating Mark Kristensen on the No-sc 3lap charts, like 1 PR to go. He never saw it coming. He's been trackhopping a ton and cut 13.5 AF, making the combined top 100. Good going man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#95 ZJ Insanity</font> the wii wheel god managed to get a couple of PR's after a while of not doing much TTs. 2:12 on BCWii sticks out, good shit man.<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#105 Shane Hogan</font> has not been doing his homework on the time submission format, if he posts one more bad submission he's getting blocked. Ok for real he got a pretty nice 1/3 time on rDKJP glitch, showing me and ross who's boss. Keep it up, you could 2/3 for sure. <br><br><font color=yellow>#106 Logan BbirbPog</font> got a 2/3 on DKJP what i didnt even see that, nice. He also got WW tops on BC3 and is now pushing for a sick WGM glitch run after being bested by the blithering Japanese idiot.<br><br><font color=yellow>#107 Benjamin Zenon</font> did actually improve on rWS this month wow. Good shit<br><br><font color=yellow>#109 Chaos</font> has finally passed the other chaos and is now officially the #1 ranked chaos on the PP. He improved on too many tracks to count and cut almost 19 AF and 22 positions. He's also been helping me with the submissions all the time, legend! Respect to the man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#130 Joe Coppernoll</font> the og made a comeback this month with a new rYF flap PR. Would be sick to see you get regs on 3lap again!<br><br><font color=yellow>#133 Idriz</font> improved his WGM glitch PR, hope you're doing well man<br><br><font color=yellow>#142 Michael Penninck</font> improved on GV2 no glitch and also his glitch flap, nice job M man<br><br><font color=yellow>#146 Ultra_Pear</font> has been streaming some of his attempts live which has been fun to watch. He cut 36 spots this month and entered the top 150 and has surprisingly picked up MC tas glitch now. You could get a pretty decent run there with enough grinding for sure. Good luck in whatever you decide to play next!<br><br><font color=yellow>#150 Leon Bisschops</font> also managed to get into the top 150 this month! Somehow he climbed 7 spots by LOSING AF?? Inspirational. Go get that 1:57 on CM!<br><br><font color=yellow>#160 Shawn Berry</font> has consistently zoomed his youtube pfp for years now. Not related to anything but just thought I mentioned it. He got 2:17 on MT and 3rd WW on BCWii ng this month, and the new site record! Nice nice<br><br><font color=yellow>#163 Aaron M</font> uploaded his latest BKP collection: The QM strikes back! I'm eagerly waiting for Return of the Wheelielock, I hope it's as good as this one. He cut nearly 6 AF and 9 positions. Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#182 Michael Harmon</font> PR'd twice but the stats program shows 14 PR's and a 22 AF cut????? what happened here<br><br><font color=yellow>#183 Kenneth Bernales</font>' stream title is [MKW] Trackhopping.

Welcome to the top 200 mate. Also can you tell us what country you're from, you don't have one on your profile atm <br><br><font color=yellow>#193 Jeff Z</font> improved on GV2 and made everyone else look like small worms. Truly the superior player, but he always gets unlucky on TTs :(<br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#201 Akiza</font> finally finished his timesheet and is the #1 Kenny on the PP now. Stay mad <font color=yellow>#212 Pierre Doffine</font> <br><br><font color=yellow>#206 Joshua Baldwin</font> made a surprising comeback on WGM glitch after many years, regaining WW tops there. He immediately went back to his one true love, Maple Treeway and kept pushing for the epic 3/3 turnskip run. You'll get it soon fam<br><br><font color=yellow>#214 Kjeld van Keulen</font> has joined into the Duck Squad WGM glitch flap grind. He also played 3lap and got a low 36 there. He then moved his focus to TF and some other tracks.

It was a big improvement as well, completely skipped .8! Congrats man :)<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> has been playing some nice and relaxing glitch flaps (rPB and rSGB) this month, getting WR on rPB and getting a big improvement on SGB (the superior category).

You could definitely push it a lot further looking at the splits but really nice regardless :)<br><br><font color=yellow>#90 Chaos</font> cut over 17 AF with a lot of improvements. He's been sending some of his comments to me along with loads of submissions so I'll list some here:<br><br>rYF (59.994): YESSSS I GOT THE SUB AAA fuck this track<br>rPG flap (38.988): very glad to get the 38<br>RR (2:31.298): FUCK YES. The only reason I played this is because NateSM said he was going to bop me and I couldn't let that happen, I was playing RR for a decent amount of time last night and for about 2 hours and 30 minutes today. I can't believe I jumped from a 821, to a 818, to a 811 to a 298. I was screaming \"YES\" for like a minute or 2 when I got it, It's my personal best pace by .100, and I'm very glad I could string the run together after having countless PB fails. Never touching this again.<br>GV no glitch (1:55.184): meme run but glad to improve<br>BC g (2:21.253): beat my 2/3 with 1/3 lmaoo<br><br>Thanks for helping out on the submissions and glad you're enjoying the game, I remember trackhopping and having similar times to those and it was so much fun :)<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#102 Shane Hogan</font> still doesn't know how to make submissions and will be receiving a second reminder to learn how to do them please shane i beg but yeah he played rYF and MC and cut over 4 AF and 3 spots<br><br><font color=yellow>#106 Benjamin Zenon</font> got 1:50 on rWS and is gunning for 2:31 on rBC. That sub sucks hard, good luck mate<br><br><font color=yellow>#109 Logan BbirbPog</font> improved on WGM glitch but couldn't quite get WR back. He's also getting pretty close to BC3 2:16 and just yesterday got 5th WW on MH. Great stuff once again, you can definitely push that even lower I feel.<br><br><font color=yellow>#110 Kyle R</font> improved on MG, rYF and TF, getting close to 1:49 there. Great to see veterans still playing, hope you're doing well!<br><br><font color=yellow>#139 Ultra_Pear</font> got a thousand PRs once again so it's hard to pick one but he did seem to hint at grinding for 1:18 on MC3 which would be awesome to see! And rYF flap has potential aswell. 12 AF cut and 7 positions climbed.<br><br><font color=yellow>#141 That Cake Kid</font> along with his epic DKJP WR, cut nearly 30 AF this month with some nice trackhopping.

(he did get pretty close afterwards tho). Justin also went into flaps, making up a new shroomstrat on rMR (thank you sir) as well as getting the first 45 flap on BCWii ng. He also became the first player in years to actually play MG glitch flap at a top level, going for the l2 strat and getting a 3 second flap. That shit is so hard how did you do it I tried for hours with no success.<br>Bro WTF he also improved on rWS and MH flaps + rDH new glitch strat (2nd WW run) + new rDKM glitch runs (3lap/flap) + COCONUT MALL 1:55 and still more smaller improvements dude stop your entries are getting too long<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Arvo Koskikallio</font> played rMR and is still playing rMR, got close on the old rWS glitch strat but then Ejay used my ghost to accidentally find the new strat GG no re at least it was a cross backwards sandwich<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Vincent Braixen</font> improved on MH only?? where you at man<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Vincent Nguyen</font> finally made his grand leap into the top 10, everyone clap it up boys. He improved his weakest tracks (rMR, RR and DDR) to do this and got a MT 2/3 run just for good measure. What a legend mate<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Nick Meade</font> has been getting some PBs to maintain his top 10 spot, well in there man. This push consisted mostly of glitches but some flaps in there aswell. His server also got nuked with Troy memes and has now been silenced. #Unluck<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 ZedR</font> improved on rBC and a few other no glitch categories that the stats program doesn't consider valid. #NoGlitchPhobic<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#11 AJ Rangthale</font> is apparently going for rMR WR now. Will it take him ages or will he go full LukeGB on that bitch? Will Vincent get it first? Has Jascha been secretly grinding it the entire time and unhoarding a 1:40 tomorrow? We will wait to see.<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Ross Coleman</font> has fallen into a deep state of depression after being kicked from the MKW libtard server. This caused him to fall into a spiral of self-harm in the form of Moonview Highway spear manual attempts. Ross cut inside on all the turns and managed to cut ahead of all the other players, getting the spear BKT. You've made the cut and got into the elusive multi-Alternative BKT holders club. Up the RA!<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 Olivier Luyckx</font> pushed his rWS no glitch (weird to actually have to say that now) run to a mid 1:49. Good job man, I admire the consistent improvements :)<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Nils Stoffers</font> played some BBC3, getting nice flaps but 3lap times still have more to squeeze I feel. Awesome stuff regardless!<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> finally got the 15.6 flap on rPB after getting teased by that .7 flat, insane stuff mate! After that he's been struggling to find tracks to play but rumour says he's spending some nice time on the terrorism beach to knock that dirty fenian off the WW top 10s. Good luck soldier<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> took some sort of anabolic steroids and started to push out god runs day in day out. Like what:<br><br>rSL WW tops<br>DC regs<br>MH 3rd flap<br>rMC nearly ww tops + flap WR (bye fox)<br>rSGB 1:21 + .2 flap<br>DKJP WW tops + 41 flap<br>rPG 1:59<br>and more<br><br>how did you do this all in 1 month, red charts podium is all yours<br> <br><br><font color=red>26-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#31 Logan BbirbPog</font> i think he's doing flaps now, nice 90 AF cut, #2 next month if he keeps going i reckon (he's known for stalling tho) In all seriousness tho cool shit, gj on all the stuff, biggest AF cut crown is yours<br><br><font color=yellow>#32 Dane \"i hate emilp\" Allen</font> the crazy crip got rMC 1:31 and PRd on DKJP and MH (0-1-2 noob). He also glitched on rPB lol imagine playing glitches regards mogimains <br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Aziz Abdullah</font> improved some of his weaker times but also had time to improve on rMR, getting regionals there (how on earth are american regs a 1:41.8 madness)<br><br><font color=yellow>#39 Alex Shoal</font> played GV2 and rSL (might be older times) but he did for sure get the rPG flap WR and the 38.1, cool shit man<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Luke Brown</font> got his 2 WRs (DKJP and BC3) and has been practicing for the World Cup, ITS COMING HOME cmon if UK actually win the world cup it would be insane<br><br><font color=yellow>#41 Indy Kambeitz</font> played a bunch of stuff this month, most notably he got nice ass runs on WGM and GV glitch. Keep it up, top 40 soon<br><br><font color=yellow>#48 Hunter Wells</font> finally accomplished his life's dream and is now beating Justin in 1/64 of the categories! Lets fucking goooooo but yeah seriously really epic MC glitch run, now all we need for the ww tops to be perfect is a Rob Fortune redemption<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#52 Caleb House</font> picked up the big boy category and improved his flap WR on MC glitch in epic fashion. The final 3lap time was 99:59:999. I don't think the ghost saved guys<br><br><font color=yellow>#53 Daniel Brycebank</font> spent the month looking after his hoarded ghost data files but he did have some time to improve on the best category (SGB glitch flap) and some rYF noncery later on. Nice!<br><br><font color=yellow>#56 Takeo</font> made DKJP glitch, improved on LC and beat the the GOAT Arjun as well as me on rSL ng flap. Inspirational stuff DOGE<br><br><font color=yellow>#60 Jack Gluesing</font> has been trackhopping his way 20 spots up the charts. The madman picked up RR kart strats and is gonna get top 50 soon. I'm banking on top 25 by the end of the year<br><br><font color=yellow>#62 JMM435</font> improved his MG no glitch Brazilian record, go go dude<br><br><font color=yellow>#70 Chaos</font> has been giving me all the PP updates once again, but he did have time to also climb the charts. He got to #69 but got cucked by Mr. Logan Paul. It's not all bad, now you can be #69 twice! He gave some nice comments about his times again:<br><br>rDKM g 2:07.169 / 39.387 - I couldn't believe I was able to finish this despite how nervous I was. After seeing the flap I got my nerve rate instantly went from 0 to 203982183789247832792373298239827487292384948972873276383932839784632782639236843763287723487347834283422398473982183271268923743289478645565758372982981, I'm just proud of myself getting this time with 1/3 and going from like 203 to 64.<br><br>RR 2:31.169 - Remember when I said I wasnt gonna play this again? Well NateSM came back to RR and already failed 2:31's so again couldn't let him bop me. Splits were 50.391 / 50.100, pbs / 50.678 [nerves]. I can def get a mid 2:30 and I personally want to grind this again now because back then I wasn't consistent with some of the strats (ex: the zipper after cannon, but I can do this like 100% now lol). My long term goal for this track is a 2:29 with bike and I think i'm more than capable of hitting it if I grinded for ages.<br><br>rDKJP no glitch 2:15.440  - This was a easy high 2:14 pace but then I pulled a Luke Brown L3 and went into the grass and still managed to PR. I want to focus on RR now (for obvious reason cough cough natesm cough cough) then I'll make sure to return here.<br><br>rGV2 g flap 15.181 - alright run but I could take alot more turns more tighter. The only reason I cut off more than .1 is bc my former PR was done with classic while my GCN was broken at the time. sadly i lost to the portugese world flap record by .001 (jmm) on gv2 flap<br><br>rSL no glitch 2:06.154 - Decided to play this last night because I got bored and PRed here 3 times (451, 383, 154). I set the 451 and 383 overnight then got the 154 in the afternoon. Anyway L1 was average for me, L2 was complete dogshit and L3 was a pbs for me  (splits were 42.053, 42.260, 41.841). I really want 2:05 before stopping, which I'm capable of. Ill get it soon™️<br><br>MMM 1:17.136 - I consider this a 1:16 fail bc I got caught in 2 mole trails after making low trick L3. I'll join 1:16 gang soon.<br><br>MC g 1:08.662 - I hit the goomba L1 and got my 1st 3/3 with it. Amazing.<br><br>Extensive lore once again, good stuff<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#85 Kasper</font> got WW tops on MMM like a champ and got the TF 1:50 with 1-1-1. Also Denmark made the losers finals in world cup I think go dudes<br><br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#126 Ultra_Pear</font> improved on loads of stuff to stay ahead of Invincible including: GV2 53.7, rDH 1:36, DKM g mid 2:09, rYF 18.6 flap (no stick iirc), 2:11 MT glitch etc. Keep winning!<br><br><font color=yellow>#126-1 That Jacob Loerzel Child</font> improved on loads of stuff to stay behind Pear including: 43.9 DKJP glitch, DKS 1:53.3, MT 2:06, RR 49.999 flap hot, DKM glitch 2:03.1?? nice dude, WGM 9.5 flap etc. Keep losing!<br><br><font color=yellow>#143 Enzo Leussink</font> finished his timesheet (i think chaos did this because all of the improvements seem to be 1 shroom flaps)<br><br><font color=yellow>#146 Clip80</font> has been playing a lot of the latter retro tracks to climb up like 30 positions. Looking at the timesheet there's a lot of potential left here, top 100 player in the making at least.<br><br><font color=yellow>#150 Aaron M</font> enjoyed some MG, DKS and MH but still lost some AF due to other boys<br><br><font color=yellow>#151 Leon Bisschops</font> the bagger slave has been getting some TTs as a coping mechanism to channel all the energy into shocks in 9th. He subbed 1:45 on MH by a hair and has been trying to improve his CM ng (no success yet). I'd say more but his anime pfp is making me want to move on to the next person. Sad!<br><br><font color=yellow>#178 Ethan \"thecorei7 2600 / MKSPear aka hedley family ethan\" Hedley</font> completed his timesheet with a bang and choked mt glitch runs for weeks until success and has now begun to choke dkm runs yes nice<br><br><font color=yellow>#180 2ndmatt</font> finally revealed his nationality to the mkw community (it was usa) but we still do not know why he is the 2nd matt. He is getting close to 1:18 MC3 and subbed 1:52 on TF this month. Go matt #2 you can do it<br><br><font color=yellow>#183 Nathan Socholotiuk</font> enjoyed yesterdays tournament GGs i was John Torwick 2.0, well done on completing your timesheet mate<br><br><font color=yellow>#184 Kenneth Bernales</font> got a 1:42.7 on rMR as well as some other small stuff. Go low 1:42 but bro ramp strat is for actual boomers you need to get with the times<br><br><font color=yellow>#189 Kenny M.</font> has finally seized being Akiza and with that came a 1:58 on BC3, nice stuff Kenny<br><br><font color=yellow>#193 ZappZ</font> the king of internet eyeliner improved on a couple of tracks<br><br><font color=yellow>#194 Bynt C</font> the MKW's #1 libtard has been hard at work on the kart, he got a 2:13 on DKJP ng as well as a 1:09.4 on LC. Impressive stuff, keep it up yo<br><br><font color=yellow>#195 Watcha</font> completed his timesheet and went on MKW holiday for a while. Enjoy it while it lasts bruder<br><br><br><font color=red>201-</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#203 Kjeld van Keulen</font> is climbing towards the top 200 by swatting his 2009 times one by one. Keep up the modern MKW gaming man<br><br><font color=yellow>#223 Jeroen Schepers</font> played some DKM and WGM glitch to get a news mention and then faded into the non-gamer activities once again. Sad!<br><br><font color=yellow>#232 Victor Alicea</font> the legendary shitposting champion has been spending his time pushing DKS into pretty epic territories, reaching the 1:49 a while back. He also got 2:18 on MT which is pretty nice <br><br><font color=yellow>#236 Blue C#</font> got a nice non-wallride time on MG and has been trackhopping a bunch to bop such legendary players as Teovani69<br><br><font color=yellow>#241 Teovani69</font> needed a break from last month's 69 cut so he lost AF this month instead. Nice! He is making some moves on MT glitch though, look out gamers.<br><br><font color=yellow>#245 McRaren</font>, <font color=yellow>#247 Kyon Gulliksen</font>, <font color=yellow>#248 StarBoi</font> and <font color=yellow>#253 Jeremy Betz</font> all completed their timesheets, due to Chaos' research I think. Welcome boys and/or girls<br><br><font color=yellow>#274 Elias</font> improved on too many tracks to mention and climbed nearly 25 spots!<br><br><font color=yellow>#275 Sam Rose</font> the DKM prodigy improved on DKM ng but I only saw it because he also got a random 25 on GV glitch. Truly a friend of the stats program he is.<br><br><font color=yellow>#281 Parker Johnson</font> got wheel tops on rPB no glitch with a 1:13.8, congrats!<br><br><font color=yellow>#285 Nate Schultz</font> got regionals on MT but got decimated by the wrath of Mr. Nguyen.

I had alot of close calls, like the turn before cannon, the zipper, the moonjump, and the wavy part. After getting such an amazing zipper I just wanted to finish the run and thank the lord because I did. I was really close to bouncing over the boost panel at the end, but I still managed to hit it.<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#63 Filler</font> exited IRL incognito mode for a bit and improved on rMR this month<br><br><font color=yellow>#74 Mo No</font> improved on DKSC flap nice nice<br><br><font color=yellow>#86 Kasper</font> got a 1:50.5 on TF nice nice<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#113 Ultra_Pear</font>Trackhopped a ton, cutting nearly 17 AF, but the big achievement was getting videos for all runs, respect.

What happened this month?<br><br>MH had a new consistent MT strat which lead to Justin finally getting MH WR after changing the way he plays the track for the 69th time. This lead to Luke gaining honorary status within team KNFE after some questionable comments concerning homicidal desires towards a famous member of the community who is very versed in the art of sending phallic imagery to individuals. Justin also improved his first WR by 1 millisecond afterwards to assert dominance.<br><br>Luke, however was not done there and redeemed himself and pulled the most boomer move imaginable, beating Justin's WR without the MT strat. This only increased Justin's descent into memes and legend says he is currently attempting Cock Island WR for at least 5 hours per day.<br><br>Sosis finally pulling through another one of his marathon WR grinds, this time bopping Jascha on rMR. Jascha is now WRless for the first time since 1 March 2009, having held at least one WR for over 11 years. Congrats Sosis!<br><br>Jared got GV no-sc WR and 2:08 (on waluigi stadium) and has been doing his mod duties superbly on the public TT discord which, naturally is a conversation platform for only the wisest and most intellectual individuals. Congratulations for all your achievements this month!<br><br>Connor from twd98 got the Mushroom Gorge ng WR with a clutch as hell lap 3.

He pushed rWS to a 1:48, got MC 48 with his new treeless treeclip, beat the WGM ng flap WR by a single millisecond (i hate justin), rWS ng flap WR (oldest flap WR bopped by a new shroomstrat smh... also Totom's last WR is rip) killed and resurrected rBC glitch flap in a single week and, most importantly, challenged the rSGB glitch flap king Jack Gluesing with a new TAS glitch flap.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Logan BbirbPog</font> made his way up to #2 this month after grinding a few flaps and also improved like every red chart category to reach top 5 over there aswell, pretty pogchamp. He also pushed DC really far, getting 3rd WW over there. And he got 48.3 on MC glitch with the new strat ofc. Next up, rBC glitch. Just remember to not shroom late!!!<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 BTEC Logan</font> copied logan and also played Daisy Circuit, god try to be a little original at least...

After this, however he was caught off guard by a pesky man simply named Justin trying to contend his title of the unquestioned champion on the greatest category in the game. Jack got straight to business, beating Justin's run relatively soon with a 17.0 but wasn't satisfied. He decided he wanted more. 16 was in sight and it could not slip away now. He waited and waited for the bombs and eventually got the god run, subbing 17 and proving to Justin that he is nothing compared to Jack G. He would not be intimidated on his track ever again. <br><br>and then he got another 16.9 but faster what the actual hell<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#13 AJ Rangthale</font> casually popped up again with a 2nd WW run on GV2 ng. Nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Ross Coleman</font> abandoned his principles and only played non-spear tracks for the entire month, getting some PBs on tracks such as rBC, BC and rWS, probably due to playing online TTs too much and always losing on these tracks! He also improved his time on CM ng deeper into the 1:56 territory. <br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Jake Harrison</font> is still so god damn loud god i never want to call with him again. He improved on BCWii as well as rBC this month.<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Nils Stoffers</font> got a bunch of times this month but his big focus seemed to have been rYF and he almost knocked me off regionals 30 minutes after I set my time but was barely slower.

This is not good I hope you recover from this. Although thanks to his depression he could ignore all worldly responsibilities and focus 100% on Time Trials. Chaos (identity exposed) has been hard at work trying to cover up his ugly history of using anime miis for personal records.

He did get the flap WR though and we finally have a public vid for that (Bryce's runs are on onlyfans only). He also got a bunch of other stuff and is officially better than Ultra_Pear as of December 5th 2020.<br><br><font color=yellow>#77 Bernie is still on the ballot, vote!</font> is not as good as Jacob Loerzel, nor did he escape the clutches of twitter.

Anyway, the MG and rGV2 runs are both classic examples of how I improve. I get a really good pace and then put an insane lap 3 at the end. MG is under a quarter of a second of my best splits. and gv2 is about .07 off my best splits. TF is a different story. I missed the low trick lap 1, but it worked out as I was barely slow enough to get under the lap 3 stompers without hitting them.

He started off with flaps, even getting BC3 ng flap WR (which swiftly got beaten by luke on his 2nd try are you kidding me).

Let's put up some of my favourite submissions of his:<br><br>rBC (No-SC) Flap: 49.786 - This time w/ Funky Flame lmao. It had some wheelie notches and a Superman that's not actually a Superman. Goal is to beat 49.644 aka Kevin Borne's PB.<br><br>\"But why that guy?\" you may ask... Well, he is an old Site Champion from 2008, but also the \"worst\" good French player. He has a red AF of ~180 and he's 8th French, I'm 9th w/ 306 AF so yeah pretty big gap separating bad and better players. And my goal is to beat him and be one of those better players. Ratio is 3/64 wins for now, it'll be quite the journey and I'm not 100% sure I'll beat him before 2022 tbh. But hey, having a goal is cool it lets you think you have something to do in your life I guess That was really too long I'm sorry if you're reading this I always comment with like 69420 words lmao<br><br><br>TF (No-SC) Flap: 35.352<br>LEGEND TIME BOIIIIIIII<br>Not only this time is the first Legend Standard I ever had, but it's also the first Legend... C Standard. Skipped LD Cheesy Also it may be in the top 10 French? It is on the PP (it's 9th), but idk if there's any time that beats this outside of the site. People just don't run Flap lmao<br>The run itself was really clean, with a nice entry to the flap, clean driving for my standards, and had a low trick (kinda? I can't tell lmao) at the end. The run I was looking for, even though I did not believe I could set it... Well I'm glad I was wrong X)<br><br>MH: 1:45.299<br>I'VE RETURNED TO MY HOME TRACK AND PB'D DAY 1 YESSSSSSSS<br>Ahem... Yes, I have a pretty cool history with this track actually. But I'm not talking about this today. Let's analyse the run. It was what I was looking for. PBS lap 1 and very good lap 3 (also PBS but I have like 3 of them so yeah...), only lap 2 is a bit weak but it's still better than my average this session. I think this could've been a King B (sub 1:45.1) if I actually TRICKED WHEN I GOT A PERFECT DOUBLE TRICK OCCASION LAP 2 HOW DID I MISS IT. Anyway, this is good for my standards and my current strategies as well I think (there are many things I don't do, you'll see by yourself) and I definitely won't give this another shot until 2021.<br>Oh, and IT BEATS KEVIN BORNE YES (8th French and I'm 9th if you want to know). It's still only a 5/59 win ratio between us, but hey, a win is a win.<br>(Yes it was copied from the video's description.

He got 1:29.3 on DC, low 1:18.1 on MC3, a casual 2:16.6 MT turnskip run as well as a bunch of other stuff. but he eventually looked at his statistic and found a horrifying truth which hindered his gaming session and caused deep mental trauma.<br><br>JustinToday at 00:23<br>I lost a wr to troy<br><br>hopefully you recover.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Logan BbirbPog</font> started the month off with his TF WRs and afterwards got not only the rBC 3lap glitch WR, <u>but also the flap WR with a 32\"459</u>.

Good luck on your future endeavours.<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Vincent Braixen</font> accused me of false claims of being a Logan copycat so he played SGB just like Logan good stuff (tbf he did find his own identity and played DDR aswell).

He also got some mediocre PRs on MT and MC3, altogether a pretty disappointing month from you :(<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Zed R</font> got a 2:01 on DKM as well as a DKJP glitch PR at the start of the month as well as a TF glitch PR towards the end. After the new year he fixed his dirty ways and stopped playing glitches, good job on your reformation.<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Jack Gluesing</font> is back in the top 10 and improved on too many tracks to mention, the big ones definitely being LC 1:09.200 and MMM 1:15.959 at the start of the new year.

Top 10 was lost to the prodigy but hope is not lost. Keep up the grind mate.<br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Nick Meade</font> has been practicing for online TTs and has got a bunch of PRs as a result. He also improved his 2009 DKJP PR by nearly a second. Top 10 might be gone for now but the dream of MMM WR live on! Go nick and please make MT TT lab good, there are so many people who can't play MT (Ross, David and Thomas to name a few).<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Jay Rangthale</font> has started another one of his grinds that will take him onto the depths of human phyche. All to dethrone Blaze on his final WR track. One leaks, the other one hoards, but who will be victorious at the end? We will see.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Ross Coleman</font> got a small TF glitch improvement with his new strat but leaked it to the world for the greater good so Logan could strengthen his WR and finally beat Luke in WR count. After this good deed he went forward with small improvements across the board. 2:18.3 on MT aswell, perhaps I treated you harshly by grouping you with David and Thomas on this track.<br><br><font color=yellow>#15 Jake Harrison</font> bopped me on rWS for the glory of the great white north. I had the (dis)pleasure of hearing this man's voice once again and he instantly reminded me of why I had not called with him after his screech reached 140 dB and has permanently reduced my ability to listen to nightcore. Curse you jake<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Nils Stoffers</font> improved on rDH and WGM ng and has been gone for a month now<br><br><font color=yellow>#21 MKRFirestone</font> clearly had some time off during the holidays and he submitted a bunch of small improvements until the secrets of the one true flap pulled his attention over and he felt like touching cones for a few days. This lead to a new DC flap WR of 28.168, a time that, I trust will last for a long time since nobody in their right mind can handle this category for longer than 10 minutes.<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Takeo</font> went in hard this month with a 23.5 AF cut and cutting over 20 positions. Too many tracks to mention but to me SGB 18 seconds stands out!!!!! it's an honour to have you on the greatest top 10 known to man. also 38.8 rDS flap how do you randomly get these great flaps (thinking back to DKJP)<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> finally reached #2 on the red charts, awesome stuff man, ultra deserved.

GL with having to deal with trump for 4 more years (guys he won by so much can you stop arguing america)<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Dane Allen</font> got his first run on rSL I think since his AF cut was quite big. Also smaller improvements, most recently a 1:16.5 on MMM.<br><br><font color=yellow>#31 Carter Clem</font> cut over 5 AF with 16 improvements, 1:31 rMC being among those 16. Another month like that and we're talking top 25, GL!<br><br><font color=yellow>#35 Indy Kambeitz</font> started the month with a 19.064 GV and kept his glitching ways up with a CM 35.5 around christmas.<br><br><font color=yellow>#37 Danny Gallenberger</font> got a 1:50.7 TF ng yesterday to clutch his mention this news update.<br><br><font color=yellow>#38 Aziz Abdullah</font> got an epic 2:12 on DKJP as well as a 1:56 CM. Also some other PRs probably due to online TT practice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#41 Luke Brown</font> improved his rBC WR as said before and he also tied it after with a new BKS of 50.095 on L3. He also set a random 1:49 on DKS. He also got his twitch suspended due to racism :( We've all been there bro, glad you're back streaming again! WAIT LUKE WATCH OUT ITS VINCENT HES COME TO TAKE MC3 EMERGENCY GRIND NOW<br><br><font color=yellow>#43 Alex Shoal</font> reclaimed his DKJP spiral skip tops with a 2:12.166.<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Kevin Miller</font> should really be writing these news updates. He also scrolls through CTGP DB even more than James Villa. Chaos got a ton of PRs once again, the big ones imo being a 1:34.1 on rDH glitch as well as a 29.6 ng flap without wheeliecut. Also MMM 1:16.5 and 23 flap is pretty damn epic. His anti-anime grind continues and he has already messaged me of another improvement that covers up his anime mii phase.<br><br><font color=yellow>#49 Hunter Wells</font> had one of the stupidest and the most obscure WR fails I've ever seen in my life, he made the rWS glitch without shrooming on the backwards hop and used his 3rd shroom in the air after the ramp l1??? That's so fucking painful. Crazy that we now have 5 glitch runs though<br><br><br><font color=red>Not even trying bro did you really think I play for AF xD (and Ultra_Pear)</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#52 Bryce</font> got his DKJP WR for a few days but the god run is still in the making. Do it or you're a fraud like luke_gb<br><br><font color=yellow>#56 JMM435</font> went in this month and got some nice times like sgb glitch flap and wgm 9.318 flap. Nice jmm435<br><br><font color=yellow>#60 Fraudtality</font> played his annual MKW session yesterday but said fuck it let's keep going XD and already broke that promise 13 days into the year. cmon man have some integrity :( His only improvement this month was a mid 2:27 on RR (correct vehicle)<br><br><font color=yellow>#64 Filler</font> popped up with a 52.935 on GV2 in his usual manner.

Better luck next time<br><br><font color=yellow>#75 Bynt C</font> outclassed Pear with his 1:09.3 on LC as well as his 1:21 SGB after his heartbreaking fail to QM (if QM stands for inQorrect iMputs) No SGB glitch flap aswell, very disappointing. Regardless, Bynt made big cuts this month and cut almost 50 spots to get into the top 75.<br><br><font color=yellow>#80 Mo No</font>, by his own words \"got this years pb\" with a 1:52.889 on rWS. Let's see if he holds onto that better than kenny m held onto retirement<br><br><font color=yellow>#89 Watcha</font> has been doing Ace Beaton facecam streams on Twitch.

But yeah, so many things have happened and this will probably take like 8 hours to write so I'm just gonna get right into it, let's recap<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>ARTHUR MKW MADE HISTORY, he made RR glitch literally about 5 minutes after my last news update which is why that wasn't mentioned. Really happy to see it happen and super proud of the community for showering with kindness (and dollar dollar bills)<br><br>New glitch on KC happened just yesterday when I'm writing this, Justin proved all the haters wrong and made it super fast. Grats to Justin and can't wait to see others make it in the future too. (Also new glitch category on the PP, marking everything as no glitch is getting stupid)<br><br>Jack Gluesing (hero) improved his rSGB glitch flap WR by a single millisecond, once again showing everyone the glorious SGB glitch way of life. Mad props.<br><br>The king of the PP Paul Allain received a Player of The Week award for improving his entire timesheet in a week. Historic moment y'all<br><br>Bryce goτ rξkT once again with yet another Jacob \"The DKJP Kid\" Invincible Mario MK Ejaycob B Loerzel Jacob DKJP Glitch WR, lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br><br>Justin (I hate him) achieved pizza delivery with his new DDR WR, but there's still a while to go to beat the actual WR by Blackyboi<br><br>rPG technically faster flap glitch is not also faster in practice thanks to Alex King and his immaculate wheelieturns<br><br>Logan is stalling on the WGM 31 (classic) and the race to the sub between him, McRaren and new challenger Ray is proving to be a fun one to watch. Stay tuned folks (UPDATE: LOGAN HACKED MY COMPUTER AND UNHOARDED HIS 31.8 TO MAKE ME WRITE EXTRA SENTENCES FOR THE NEWS UPDATE FUCK YOU LOGAN)<br><br>Luke did some really insane work on his own WRs this month, pushing rBC and rMC to unimaginable levels. As much as he is now tied with Logan for the most WRs (hahahahahahahaha fraud gb), some of his WRs are going to stay until the end of fucking time.<br><br>Logan bullies small children and takes their rWS glitch WRs. This will not be tolerated in this community, as we have a zero tolerance bullying policy and will be banning Logan from all competitions until further notice (serves him right, he's a big nerd and looks gay)<br><br>des (lowercase d because he has a small D) finally reclaimed his MC WR after a silent grind, but once again speed-bully Logan stole des' hard earnt record. Shameful.<br><br>Benny pulled off the first ever MT 3/3 run with his batshit inside the ground strategy. He got like a 1:54 but there's potential for some big moves on there<br><br>I saw Luke getting a 1:46.6 on DDR but I'm pretty sure that's just a dream I had last night<br><br>Niyake is the most undisputed among the undisputed kings of a track, finally pulling through and getting a 15 second time on GV. He said 14 will be hard. I think I agree with Niyake on this one.<br><br>Sosis (NO RUBER) dethroned Blaze on GV2, completing another one of his monster grinds and knocking Blaze to 0 WRs (5 if you count the ones he's hoarding)<br><br>Nao just got KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR KC CR<br><br>Oh yeah new summoning salt video was quite epic, had to drop everything to watch that on my TV in the dark. Felt like watching a fully fledged documentary, props to all who contributed<br><br>Volpe admitted to cheating and got removed from the PP that's a king sized XXL bruh moment<br><br>Vincent Brakekekekekekekekeken (12 years old) stole Luke's hard earnt MH WR in predatory fashion. This is so sad, can we please subscribe to lukegb on twitch.<br><br>Speaking of things of a predatory fashion, James Charles got caught sending nudes to children again, bad influence from the MKW community I see<br><br>Even more predatory-related news, Creepyproduce unlisted his nonce videos lol, I'll put the links here and check on them here and there to see when they get deleted so I can reupload them:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYrv-15JRLw\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYrv-15JRLw</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a> (this one's a rickroll, I don't recommend clicking on it)<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQN0ZwlJSXk\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQN0ZwlJSXk</a><br><br><br>if he gets lounge unbanned before me im leaving the community forever and deleting everybody's timesheets on the PP as well as MKLeaderboards<br><br><br>Quote of the month:<br><br>Eat a dick, Luke.

He smoked some Happy Hippo™ Kratom and wondered to himself how epic it would be if the Rapide (yes, rapide gang, fuck zip zip that shit cringe) was faster on DKJP. And then it was. He also thought KC glitch should be RTA-viable, and then that dream was real also. THEN HE ALSO MADE THE KC GLITCH RTA AND GOT WR calm the fuck down Justin!!!! Also DDR wr gg ez Fraud_GB destroyed once again (I hate justin for this).<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Logan bBirbPog</font> Logan's month consisted of a ton of WRs that I already mentioned as well as a 1:57.9 on BC3 g and a 2:16.8 on ng. He also got a 33.562 DDR flap! Congrats Logan!<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Vincent Braixen</font> stole Luke's hard earnt MH WR and is grounded for three weeks. And today is punishment day.<br><br>First punishment: Running him over with my car<br>Second punishment: Watching JordanTheVyonder2002 Productions for 24 hours<br>Third punishment: Calling with Jake Harrison on max volume for 3 hours<br>Fourth punishment: Death.<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Arvo Koskikallio</font> got his 11th WW 58 time on rYF (life is a pointless void but at least i got the sexiest sub in this game) as well as an unsatisfactory flap PR with a drop at the end. Towards the end of February my mental state begun to deteriorate so badly that I switched over to the heavenly bliss of rSGB TAS glitch to escape the constant pain of missing the stick every lap. It paid off and I had a fun time writing job applications while playing MKW.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 Thomas van Deerse</font> took a break from the normal life and returned to the pits of hell on rWS ng flap. He managed a 35.4 (which is 3rd place iirc) pretty fast which is very nice.<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 David Morton</font> bald cunt retard pussy crybaby bastard nonce never updating your prs let sam do it. UPDATE: Sam did it. David got some epic PRs like MMM 1:15 (apparently bad according to david). He also got rPG 1:59 (no he didnt LOL) as well as a BC3 3/3 ultra (again, keep dreaming bro). For real he got magi BKT on rSL which is pretty nice (still a bad run according to david)<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Zed R</font> got frightened by the powers of Jack Gluesing and Vincent Nguyen and realised he needs to defend the honour of the Fatherland and remain on the top 10 til the end. He played a metric fuckton of categories and got so many PRs, maybe the coolest ones being a TF 1/3 1:47.6 and a new rMC 1:31.4. Keep up the fight mate.<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Jack Gluesing</font> the quintessential MKW madlad achieved the following things this month:<br><br>- 2:18 KC<br>- A legendary 1 millisecond improvement on heavenly waiting game category<br>- Addiction to MH leading to a 1:43.6 and a 33.0 flap<br>- 1:59 rPG<br>- Joining the discord server and abandoning his mystery man status<br>- And so much more<br><br><br><font color=red>Permavirgins</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#11 Vincent Nguyen</font> begun his month with a slick 1:33.2 on rDH sc and moved onto DC where he got a sub (1:31 sub) with a time of 1:30.005. After this he once again did some soul searching and discovered himself to be going full steam ahead on GV2, achieving both 3lap ng WW tops <u>as well as a new glitch flap WR with a time of 13.574</u>!<br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Nick Meade</font> got himself new CM ng 3lap and flap times as well as a 1:18.3 on MC3. He also managed made another great WR recap video which I tried to watch while falling asleep, it was a very hypnotic experience.<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Jay Rangthale</font> had unprotected (NO RUBER) intercourse with GV2 until he came all over its pretty face and achieved a new WR. After this he picked up rMC and got a 1:31.0 and is already getting WR splits. He's gonna play this shit for like 5 months isn't he.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Ross Coleman</font> got a 1:33.8 rDH 3/3 run WHICH LOSES TO TROY LMAO LMAO LMAO THIS IS SO FUNNY you are very shit! He did also get 1:56.4 CM and a 2:04.2 rSL (not quite Arjun tier but still rather epic). He also flexed his quirky spear abilities (he's not like other boys, he prefers speed over drift) on rDH and got a 1:35.4 as well as leeching off Justin's KC glitch run with a pair of fresh new shroomless spear BKS' (these were beaten by Braixen and ross is currently contemplating suicide in the TT chat, F)<br><br><font color=yellow>#15 Jake Harrison</font> beat jery on MH with his very own 1:43.6. He also hopped on GV2 glitch real quick and got his new 52.5 time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 Takeo</font> continued his crazy spree, climbing another 7 spots and joining the real degen boys in the top 20. He got dozens of PRs, among them being really high ranked flaps on rDS and WGM as well as some really nice 3lap times like 1:13.3 rPB (getting a glitch run here would be big) as well as a 1:49 TF g run (his ng run is still unfortunately standing at a 1:51.omega). Some other cool runs are a 1:51.7 WGM ng, 1:35.8 rDH ng, 1:18.4 flat on rMC3 as well as a DC 1:29.7. Pretty good PR spree bro, let's keep it up and challenge the top 10!<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Dane Allen</font> got 1:50 rWS and 2:31 rBC (I am so jealous omfg) as well as a nice MG cookie flap on the side, thats pretty epic for an item box player<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Stavros Ferentinos</font> is still somehow in the top 25, i swear he's been #25 for like the past year. Anyway, he played a bit of the spear stuff at the start of the month with new times on MC and rPB. After this he realised that the glorious European heritage was in danger on DKM glitch and thought if nobody else is gonna defend the honour it might as well be him. He mixed his glitch sessions with ng and achieved some really sick times on all 4 DKM categories but the crown jewel was a 2:00.4 on glitch. Thank you for representing all Europe, I will do all I can to nullify Greece's dept (The Player's Page council secretly controls the European parlament dw).<br><br><br><font color=red>There's still some hope</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Luke Berrill</font> set his first PRs this decade with a low 1:32 on rMC as well as a low 1:51 on rWS. Welcome back mr bigshot POTY 2014<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> got a very very low 2:06 on rDS and a high 2:18 on BC3 ng. He also had some rPB attempts which had major potential but the track is what it is.

Ironically it seems that DK is probably Luke's closest match here. Luke then moved to optimizing his rPG BB time and pushed it to a 1:59.4 with the Scorpi strat™. Then he decided to smack his rMC record and it's at an insane level now. Good job Luke.exe.<br><br><font color=yellow>#45 Alex Shoal</font> deserves more credit in speedrunning.

        "content": "<p><b>The MKW grind is identical to the righteous ways of spiritual men. We dedicate our lives to the cause, distancing ourselves from worldly pleasures, remaining celibate, all for the good grace of reaching God (standard). Thanks to this realization I no longer regard top players as degenerates, but great prophets, the purest of all men. I'm glad to call you brothers and sisters in the fight for enlightenment. Mango Man was right all along.<br><br>Thanks to this realization this news update will be dedicated to the holy and mysterious ways of Kart. I hope you enjoy reading the gospel on this holiest of days.<br><br>So what happened during this month of Lent? What sacrifices were made? Let's find out.<br><br><br>The month's achievements started off with Evangelist Luke Brown fighting off the evil spirits of Braixen to reclaim ownership for what was truly his, the MH crown. Congratulations Luke.<br><br>The next great battle was fought on Maple Treeway, the second holiest of all sites within the ways of Kart, thanks to Benny's strat finally being picked up like a year after discovery lol. The famed JCool reclaimed his past ways after years of sin and was forgiven by our Lord Troy Dunbeck, who granted him a World Record. Unfortunately the evil might of Logan was too great to hold off, and the antichrist took this WR from him.<br><br>The antichrist would however, not be unstoppable this month. His vulnerabilities was exposed by Hunter, the man from God's city, the Holiest of all non-MKW locations: Texas. Hunter would fight off the urge to surrender his grind to the great evil, and finally all his pain was taken away with 2 new WRs on rWS. All he had to do to break the curse was to praise QM, the holiest of all game mechanics.<br><br>A humble man simply named Justin completed his struggle towards the 1:46 on DDR. Unfortunately his ways are not pure, and God punished him with a missed trick on the Final Lap, causing Justin to fail to beat Saint Blackyboi and remain 2nd place once again.<br><br>Patience is a virtue. This was known by the ancient stylites such as Simeon, who climbed a pillar in Syria in the year 423 and stayed there until his death 37 years later. This similar trait can be found in some of the greatest karters of the day, such as Jack Gluesing, who once again improved his SGB glitch flap this month. Stay pure, stay devoted.<br><br>Barney, the banished Norwegian karter came back with a bang on GV ng with a new clutch WR with a new L3 BKS. Naturally this run is only recognized by the unholy and sinful sites of MKLeaderboards and MKwrs. Barney will never be able to inherit the kingdom of God. God hates filthy cheaters and does not forgive these sins. Repent.<br><br>Big man james charles sexted with kids once again, THE MKW COMMUNITY IS SO PROUD OF YOUUUUUUUU even troy does collabs with you now, keep doing what you're doing bro!!!!!!!!! official verdict: definitely going to hell (and not just for being gay!) (am i actually gonna leave that in) (yeah its funny dont cancel pls)<br><br><br>Quote of the month:<br>Some days have been rough for me last year and something that put a smile on my face was watching CP videos at night.<br><i>SpicyDorito08</i><br><br>Bible Quote of the month:<br>For nothing will be impossible with God.<br><i>Luke 1:37 (this is why he has so many WRs)</i><br><br>This news update covers from Mar 2 2021 to Mar 31 2021<br><br><br>Newcomers to the faith:<br><br><font color=lime><br>Acquiesce (Australian)<br>Robvin (what)<br>Nicolas Chomette (hon hon)<br>Hedwig (#3 Finnish, #2 Savonmaa)<br>William Texas (he actually joined what)<br>Jack1337 (the kinda guy to type 5318008 into a calculator)<br>MxCraven (McRaren x Wes Craven mashup)<br>JoshNFLD (doin your dad)<br>Alex Maia (Portuguese)<br>Ethan Paul (Jake Paul Brother)<br></font><br><br><br><font color=red>The Divine 10</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 Justin \"Holy Father of Kart\" Hitchcock</font> started the month by achieving the joy of a 1:46 on DDR with a missed zipper trick. Afterwards he realised to TAS GV2 ng? And found that the ramp can be faster by like literally .05 every lap on RTA lol. Due to his hatred towards tricks after the DDR run, he decided not to use them in his new RTA run however, but instead using the start slide with the bowser bike to save like 4 ms??? God truly works in mysterious ways.<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Logan \"Glitch reliant heathen, sinful false prophet, The Antichrist\" bBirbPog</font> focused on taking the MT glitch WR back from the righteous man. Only glitches this month as usual. Never trust a man who plays glitches.<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Arvo \"MKW Gospeler\" Koskikallio</font> has been on a big rYF break after not getting anything for ages, hopping on the MT bandwagon, getting a 2/3 that lost 2 seconds after l3 cannon fml. Also played MT and GV g flaps (hydr8ion was destroyed) as well as some rBC for 2:31 and rSGB glitch flap to reach enlightenment. Right now I'm too busy blaspheming to play MKW however.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 David \"Proverbs 22:24\" Morton</font> got a bunch of times to cut AF this month as well as actually getting BC3 3/3 ultra (this was actually last month but I didn't mention it which caused him to call be a naughty word) He also got rPG sub 2 with the incorrect vehicle, 1:41(.945!!!!) rMR, 1:48 DDR and a brand new TF no glitch PR! All of this, however, is just distraction from daFact that he does not have 58.5 on rYF LOL! imagine not having 58.5! He also sent me some new times but i dont really care so i wont mention them except for the fact that he bopped Thomas yes!<br><br><font color=yellow>#9 Jack \"King David\" Gluesing</font> played a bunch of stuff for AF but did also get some bangers, including a better 1:59.99x on rPG and an INCREDIBLE 16.7 rSGB flap. 16.6 is actually possible, keep going you beautiful man.<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Zed \"Colin Dickson\" R</font> got a KC (no glitch) flap lol<br><br><br><font color=red>The followers</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#11 Vincent \"not that Vincent\" Nguyen</font> had a relatively slow month, only really playing KC at first but eventually reaching enlightenment on the one and only SGB glitch flap, getting 3rd WW there. Congratulations on becoming a true chad.<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Jay \"Ejay\" Rangthale</font> played some really weird stuff but found his next passion project on rMC, getting a 1:30 pretty fast and also achieving l2/3 BKS with a 30.007. 29 is soon. Legend says he will get rMC WR thanks to a 40 days and 40 night grind after this news update.<br><br><font color=yellow>#14 Jake \"Job 39:5\" Harrison</font> SGB glitch YES YES YES but he beat me on rSL glitch because of better driving how cringe. He also played some weird stuff like rMC and DKS which is pretty cool but nobody really cares, we will all die one day and these runs will mean nothing lol<br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Ta \"DOGEcoin\" keo</font> did a bunch of AF grinding to bop a grand total of 1 person (Silver). Pretty epic L2 glitch run on DKJP tho, lets go<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Bynt \"Imagine having a dot at the end of your name\" .</font> cut an ungodly amount of AF to rocket straight from #50 to the top 20 this month. He improved on like half the tracks lol. Highlights: rPG 1:59.8, rWS 1:52.069 (funny number) (use turnskip sword wannabe), DKJP 1:48 (bullied into sinning on glitch categories, and 2:13.1 on non-sinful DKJP<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Luke \"The Evangelist\" Brown</font> got an MH 2nd WW (Chad has wr) and is going for the legendary 1:42. He also learned the evil ways of glitching which caused him to get all the way to the top 20 just like Bynt. When is that sub 1 on WGM coming THO<br><br><font color=yellow>#22 Dane \"Mogi\" Allen</font> was a glitchscrub (just like Luke) and played MT, DKM and DKJP glitches.

He had to hop onto the bandwagon and stay relevant, which he did, getting a low 1:54 with the new method.<br><br><font color=yellow>#39 Ruby \"im from aruba bro trust me\" Aruba</font> got random flaps on LC and MC3 after not playing since march 2020?<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Kevin \"The messenger of the Player's Page\" Miller</font> only cut a bit of AF this month despite playing quite a few categories, his main claim to fame was definitely doing a little trolling on the MKL mods by mixing times up with Jyran and stuff I can't even remember who got what time, but regardless he did get a new rDH glitch time but is no longer on the WW tops lol! at least he beat troy<br><br><font color=yellow>#44 Joe \"mama\" blase</font> Played too much MKW this month and completed his timesheet thanks to submitting last place times on a few of his least favourite tracks. Bro git gud some of your times are Korben down syndrome tier<br><br><font color=yellow>#45 Alex \"Innovators in speedrunning deserve more recognition.\" Shoal</font> deserves more recognition.

Still no rWS flap WR tho :( :( :(<br><br><font color=yellow>#49 Dane \"Gostma\" M</font> got funky fresh rPG and DDR (1:48!)

He also totally destroyed Ultra_Pear this month with a giant almost 20 AF cut. The most notable of these times is definitely his random out of nowhere 53.8 on MC. I guess he learned tas glitch.<br><br><font color=yellow>#61 F\"uck scorpi\" atality</font> got a ton of PRs this month despite never really playing the game that much lol... I'm not even gonna mention any of the times because he never plays the game he had his yearly session of the year in january...<br><br><font color=yellow>#64 Wii \"Actual\" Lord \"and saviour of MKW for real this time\" 95</font> made his comeback 2.0 to get sub 2 on MT with the Benjamin strategy, it was actually on CTGP this time HAHA GOTTEM I WROTE THIS ON APRIL FOOLS IT WASNT ON CTGP<br><br><font color=yellow>#70 Ultra \"Wageslave\" _Pear</font> just told me to go sleep but i failed so I'm just gonna write mean things about him instead like LOL you are a total of 12 positions behind Invincible.

The PP got in contact with Mr. Albanese for an interview, here's what he had to say:<br><br>Nope definitely not thinking about mkw rn, so happy I don't play it anymore (it sucks so much!!) god I hope that the ppl who still play it get a life someday<br><i>Jordan Albanese</i><br><br>I hope your wishes will come true Mr. Highway. We will be waiting to accept you back into the community with open arms in a few months!<br><br>And in other news, the community legend who's real name I cannot disclose for legal reasons due to him being removed from the PP, got removed from the PP. I will refer to him only by the codename \"Trisomy-21\". So. Trisomy-21 finished the work of the great Thomas Capel who was sadly bluepilled some time ago. Trisomy-21 said so many gamer words and spread so many jewish conspiracy theories that the powers at will booted him from the site. These mods would never survive in cod lobbies smh!!!!!<br><br>oh yeah and sword0fseals also got booted from the site for some good old relations with a 16-year-old, Naomi groomed 3 kids, Colin the mega mushroom is mad because he admitted to pedophilia and now people are disliking his videos but you know let's sweep all that under the rug so the community can have a good image guys<br><br><br>Ok now that we have documented the legendary stories, we will actually talk about the game and definitely not talk about pedophilia again because that's not an appropriate topic to discuss with minors reading the news update, kids should just be blissfully unaware about this so they're easier to take advantage of, eh?<br><br>so yeah<br><br>Logan implemented the rDS shroomless dock which caused Luke_GB to go on a moral mission where he was not going to be using mt strat even though it was COMPLETELY FREE, simply because he wanted to use the strats he was comfortable with. Luke got a 2/3 shroomless dock run shortly after.<br><br>Flare pushed his RR slower category WR further and further but SURPRISE CHALLENGER, Kaede, approached his record with rejuvenated drive to lessen the American imperialists' grip on the WR count. He is very close and I'm hopeful that we will see RR pushed down to 2:24.4 at some point in the future with this new competition.<br><br>Sosis pushed rMR to a 1:41.1, and I heard through the grapevine that he was paid $200 for this feat by an unnamed sponsor. dont spend it all at once mate<br><br>The legendary MKW's 3rd best Vincent finally got himself a WR, on GV2 glitch of all courses. This WR lasted 3 days after which Logan pushed it down to a 49 which is what Logan tends to do. It's not all over though, since Vincent has proven himself to be pretty damn good at the glitch, finishing L1 BKS shortly after Logan's push. This ain't over yet Logan!<br><br>And yeah Logan got a ton of WRs mostly on TF yeah yeah don't care I only support the underdogs<br><br>Quote of the 2 and a half months:<br><br>@Hydr8ion news<br><i>MKW community as a whole</i><br><br><br>Bible quote of the 2 and a half months:<br><br>See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!<br><i>Galatians 6:11</i><br><br><br>This news update covers from June 11 2021 to August 28 2021<br><br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime><br>Spencer Sassak (fellow obscure statistic nerd/#1 link provider)<br>Stork (Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills.)<br>Mattinatorr (this is the kinda username you make when you're 12 and you're forced to live with the rest of your life)<br>James Collins (normie name)<br>Raphael Atherton (the ph in raphael is a nice touch, props to your parents, S-tier name for sure)<br>James Murask (James Villa is the one true James in my book)<br>Gabe M (you wish you were g walers)<br>Cam..

He also improved rBC ng tonight i think but I cba to check what it was either way good job keep up the domination<br><br>I am <font color=yellow>#4 Arvo Koskikallio</font> and I don't want to refer to myself in the third person again because to comes off as arrogant which I definitely am not (this is sarcasm, i am a legend and only lose to people because i don't really try that hard lol). So yeah. I started off by pushing my rPB ng time down to a 1:13.1, then briefly trackhopping until playing rWS for a few hours and somehow getting the god run for my standards and almost getting 1:50 despite not knowing how to play the track and always failing all the tech lmao always lucky. After that I moved on to MMM which was surprisingly kind of fun and I pushed my PB to 1:16.1 and somehow clutching the fuck out of flap and finishing a 23.8 bye bye never playing that flap again lets gooo. Then I moved on to CM glitch (shroomless entry is eternal pain please give advice) and LC (failed 1:09.3 at l3 cut aaaaaaaaaaa) Ok yeah thats enough of talking about yourself you egocentric man<br><br>The young prodigy <font color=yellow>#9 Jack Gluesing</font> finished off the LC grind with a .750 flap and moved on to TF, where he got close to both 1:49 3lap and 34 flap but atm it's just unfinished business for this legend. In July he tackled one of his weaker tracks, BCWii glitch, getting to a reasonable base to improve upon there (+ rank 69 3lap!!!) In August he made a mockery of rBC, making 2:31 look like a cakewalk and improving his rMR closer to 1:41. These improvements were accompanied by world-class flaps, as always. Totom bop is coming soon my man<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#11 Aziz Abdullah</font> improved his DKM glitch times, WGM ng as well as his rYF flap and dipped to do whatever it is people with lives do<br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Vincent Nguyen</font> got 3rd WW on TF glitch damn mate I completely forgot that happened. He also got 1:49 damn. After the TF grinds he went balls in on GV2 glitch, getting his WR and L1 BKS/Flap WR. After this Vincent decided to chill on some Bowser tracks, including BC3 ng and BCWii glitch. enjoy it<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Jay Rangthale</font> got way more things that I remembered, he got 1:55 CM???? I've been living under a rock or something, ok yeah some quality flaps on rDS and LC yeah yeah and 1:49.2 I remember that I think, ok yeah and then rMR WR + flap WR and now he's pushing rPG with BB and as I'm writing this they're arguing in the tt server whether or not .9 .7 is 1:59 pace on rPG im so proud of this community<br><br>HOW IS <font color=yellow>#14 Danny Gallenberger</font> IN THE TOP 15 WHAT PLANET ARE WE ON yeah he just trackhopped about for 2 months and cut like 20+ spots lol lets go danny G the district champion of wii wheel throwing <br><br><font color=yellow>#15 Jake Harrison</font> got a KC ng flap probably in between mogi events<br><br>How is that <font color=yellow>#19 Bynt.</font> #14 what's happened while I was MIA. wait what he's #19 on the charts now what the fuck is going on mr. stat program. OK I'm gonna assume #19 is right because Bynt only finishes good runs on dolphin. how did he get 1:59.5 on BC3 I want that run ok 1:47 TF is for amateurs even I have 1:46 and ok yeah 1:49.8 thats probably just tas coding the wr before the last low and he lost over .6 on the low, 1:12.888 rPB ok thats legit because thats the only track bynt can play, 2:04.7 rSL is definitely a glitch run, 2:18.2 BC3 prob sc run 2:06 DKM definitely a glitch run and 1:50.009 on DKS is 100% 3/3 jimmy, 21.7 GV is more his level of a time, 2:28.8 RR is with glitch (moonjump code on), 1:42.1 rMR was with arjuns secret glitch, 1:50.4 rWS also glitch moonjump and according to this he has a 42.7 on DKJP glitch congrats on 2nd WW! That's probably legit because he's glitch reliant. So in a nutshell I think Bynt is one of the most blatant cheaters in modern MKW history and I will be removing him from the website ASAP. (OK actually it turns out he just misspelt glitch as \"giltch\" what a dumbass  :D :D :D :D fixed that for you) (actually I have come to the conclusion that this was a deliberate attempt to appear higher up in the news update and will have to ban you for journalistic fraud. goodbye)<br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Better Steve</font> went full simp and only played daisy tracks, starting off with BC3 sc (or at least I think he used daisy because it's more consistent and better steve does not like glitches) (neither does the worse steve tbf) Steve proved his love for consistency by moving to MC3 and improving his times there. And it was BCWii g time afterwards because Jared is brainwashing the entire community to play BCWii so his WR can look better<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Luke Brown</font> got the rDS record but didnt submit and the stat program didnt pick it up and i had to add him late and that isnt so nice! how could you luke<br><br><br><font color=red>25-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Dane Allen</font> got a 1:50.1 TF and 2:20.1 KC go get those subs and stop playing ctww<br><br><font color=yellow>#30 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> is my #1 source of news about American politics but has also enjoyed some casual MKW grinds at times, clutching out a 15.659 on rPB glitch flap, getting a 27.7 rDH glitch flap + 29.7 ng as well as a 36.3 rWS flap. Loads of flaps because they're a path towards enlightenment.<br><br>Remember Joeblase? This is him now: <font color=yellow>#32 Joe S.</font>, feel old yet? Congratulations on quitting the game! Now let's go through what he did over these past few months. Joe pushed his TF time to a 1:49.725 with a phat 84 drop on l3. Afterwards Joe got a 1:50.1 DKS and a 1:52 GV! In August he has taken it easy and improved some of his weaker times, as well as re-uploading loads of times after Jordan's kamikaze attack on CTGP Alt records. Also he apparently benched 225 lbs CONGRATS!!!!!!!<br><br><font color=yellow>#45 Hydr8ion</font> has kept up with the discord side of PP updating and also grinded the game himself, climbing all the way to the top 50 from #61 with big trackhopping. His crown jewel of this new period however has to be his brand new 3.259 GV glitch flap likely motivated by my fluke improvement that beat him on this elite category.<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Phyzothy</font> got some run but i forgot what it was<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#53 JMM435</font> improved some of his weaker (aka no glitch) runs. He also learned the TAS glitch on rSGB based and redpilled + new rPB (not 1:06 since its cursed)<br><br><font color=yellow>#57 Jacob Loerzel</font> 1:50 DKS, 34 CM and getting close to 1:50 TF (with the glitch!)<br><br><font color=yellow>#62 Filler</font> got 1:49 on both TF and DDR as well as sharpening up his weaker runs. Name reveal at top 50<br><br><font color=yellow>#67 Ultra_Pear</font> got some times but what the FUCK MAN! there are significant holes in the video recordings. please sort this out as soon as possible...<br><br><font color=yellow>#75 George Alberto Mark Toad Alberto Barba</font> got wrecked on MMM and his disc drive is trying hard to stop him from coming back. Alberto trackhopped his way up the ranking by around 10 spots, GAMT invite at top 10 i promise<br><br><font color=yellow>#80 Mo No</font> choked 1:49 TF and finished a .032 ouch. One day man<br><br><font color=yellow>#81 Watcha</font> got some pretty banging times such as 1:49.6 DKS (going for 1:48!), 1:56 CM, 1:40 DKJP g (probs with that stupid sign strat) and 1:51 WGM. Good shit altar mann<br><br><font color=yellow>#85 Claus</font> grinded his way up from #121 to #85 by following the trackhopping 101 course. The standout time imo is definitely on DKJP glitch (since he actually made the glitch although i suspect its the stupid sign strat)<br><br><font color=yellow>#88 Michele Gallastri</font> also got a million different PRs that boosted him back up to the top 100. Standout is probably TF 1:50.8.<br><br><font color=yellow>#94 Ethan Hedley</font> got a solid ass 2/3 run on TF as well as a flap (only true degen gamers play TF glitch flap lets goo), also a 1:44.7 MT nice nice and some random ng times (sub 2 CM!!!)<br><br><font color=yellow>#98 Clip80</font> played rWS, WGM and rSL to maintain his top 100 status<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#117 Nate Schultz</font> didn't trackhop around that much, instead focusing on just a few courses (notably MT, where he got a new glitch and ng prs + 44.2 ng flap with 2 shrooms mate whats going on here ok that was a pretty sick turnskip tbf)<br><br><font color=yellow>#118 Kjeld van Keulen</font> played for some of that sweet AF to prevent being passed by his countryman, the filmbro who watched too many mindfuck films and now thinks MKW is reality,<font color=yellow>#121 Leon Bisschops</font>. Leon played some stuff and got 1:53 GV (although I swear he already has that) and a 1:42.3 MG which is somehow ranked outside of the top 50 and gives me another reminder that I really need to pick up the TF physics gap there.<br><br><font color=yellow>#135 Enzo Leussink</font> almost got 1:49 TF ng and almost got 1:48 TF g nice nice. Also rDH glitch time that loses to the ng WR looool how embarassing wait i also lose to the ng WR<br><br><font color=yellow>#136 Samuel W</font> got a 1:22.2 MC and then trackhopped around July and dipped.<br><br><font color=yellow>#138 ArthurOww</font> made another batch of improvements as always, this time the highlight being a 1:44.1 MH which caused him to pour out the longest essay I've ever seen.

Also damn those MT paces show 2:17 potential for sure, just gotta risk it on the logs, maybe perfect the net a little bit and take the U-turn properly. Just the tight log + U-turn fix should already save like .2 per lap if not more.

I hope you don't mind. (Just kidding it's not like you have the choice lol)<br><br><br>But you're probably wondering, how am I allowed to post a news update? Well I, along with NateSM, Arthur'Oww and Jeroen, were given by the MKW gods in our secret shrine the power of… Updating! Now we can outrun these old and lazy updaters and actually not let everyone wait 2 weeks for an update to occur! ...Well it didn't happen exactly like I just told you but that's the spirit.<br><br><br>So, what happened since the last update? Well many things since there's so much time between them. Let's review all the world records that were set during that 2 month period (this is probably just to try and get Kasey to join the player’s page).<br><br><br>To start off, the Man, the Myth, the Legend Kaede returned to the game and reclaimed his RR No-Glitch crown... twice (flare is mad), now at a 2:24.650.<br><br>LukeGBot got a couple records with another improvement on rBC and a .1 improvement on DKJP (do I even have to specify No-Glitch, it's not like he plays glitches lmao), getting the first God standard here. Only so few left...<br><br>Logan also got a few world records here and there because that’s all he cares about and des got a 1:34.999 on MT, nice sub<br><br>Kasey also improved rPB a few times pushing it to the .6 territory, and Hunter got rWS glitch back in a few hours (get owned flag).<br><br>Also sidenote, we're back with having a 1000+ days old WR, Sosis' rSGB time being undefeated since January 2019. Closest one to the milestone now is Vincent's WGM No-Glitch set in June 2019 that should hit 1000 days on March 14th 2022. Take your bets now on if it'll reach it ladies and gentlemen<br><br><br>OK that was everything now onto the hard part of the leaderboard, seriously it's soooooo long<br>...Oh but I forgot the quotes, there you go a little bit of a calm before the storm<br><br><br><br>Quote of the month:<br>“#FREEDORIAN” - MKW streamers<br><br><br>Bible Quote of the month:<br>\"This month shall be the beginning of months for you...\"<br>Exodus 12:2<br><br><br>This news update covers from August 29 2021 to October 29 2021<br><br>New Players:<br><br><font color=lime><br>Tristan Allman (7th can flame runner)<br>Tony Rolens (Not the best Tony, or the worst)<br>Flora Areola (Sounds like a flower)<br>Snape Skin (Bro you spelled snake wrong)<br>Ashley Taylor (Someone else posted their timesheet could be an alt)<br>Christian Gooding (Don’t think you can spread good to this community but gl)<br>Fritixx (Probably a minecraft player)<br>Sammie (I’m starting to run out of jokes, have a less boring name, please.)<br>Mystogan (200cc glitcher acquired)<br>Cederic (Another one acquired)<br>Ed.

Not to mention the obligatory 3 flap improvements. Nice work please write more essays they are good for procrastination.<br><br><font color=yellow>#142 2ndmatt</font> aka bickbork cried himself to sleep when Logan beat him on rmc in just a few days, so he decided to make himself feel better by getting flap WR there, which was taken by logan.

Tonight's top story is one that would scare any parent out there: A handful of terminally online people are still regularly playing a 2008 Wii game called Mario Kart Wii. Tonight we will talk about this tragedy, and the victims it has consumed over the last month. Let us remember their names.<br><br>It seems another media outlet has popped up recently, the hosts of which are two rWS glitchers who we will not name for privacy reasons. Just remember that they are fake news and should not be regarded as news, thank you<br><br>Also yes hello I am finally doing something here. You are welcome, peasants.<br><br>The biggest stories, those who perform \"world records\" are as follows:<br><br>Blake Germany has taken down the 1:45.268, a bad time that lasted 299 days, to a 1:45.210.

Ask Colin the Mega Mushroom for assistance and 1:43 is free<br><br>Justin came out of nowhere to set the long overdue <1:31 on rDH with a 1:30.990.

Pretty crazy stuff. <br><br>Luke Brown took Koopa Cape back from our favorite Korean wheeler, with a small record improvement of 13ms to a 2:17.937. We'll see a large improvement someday, right??? Way to stay patient with the grind Luke<br><br>Barney improved Grumble Volcano no glitch to a 1:51.389. Cool. Get it? Cool? And the track is LAVA??? THE OPPOSITE OF COOL???? HHAAHHAHA anyway track needs 1:50, keep playing Barney <br><br>Braixen took back the BC3 world record with a shroomless again with a 1:57.291. Emil will come in with the 1:57.292 soon, I just know it! Sub is inevitable <br><br>Toad's Factory got another forgettable improvement to a 1:44.370 by Logan<br><br>A small child named Jyran beat Niyake on Grumble Volcano. AUS NOW HAS A WR AGAIN LETS GO its going to die in a week<br><br>Kaede destroyed Flare's hopes at a world record by achieving a 2:24.589 with a very epic 48.444 lap 1<br><br>Luke Brown, after becoming a god from completing no nut november, is now participating in destroy dick- i mean delfino december.

        "content": "<p><b>HAPPY NEW YEAR KARTERS AND KARTESSES<br><br>…And happy holidays as well. Today’s News Update Day, and I’ll be honoured to be your host for what will probably end up as one of the longest News Updates in History. You know me well...<br><br><br>But before we begin the actual News, just a little reminder that the POTY (Player Of The Year) award nominations are starting just now! For those who don’t know what it is or simply forgot, it’s the contest we organize every year to elect, as the name implies, the Karter who surpassed everyone during the year. It consists of 2 phases:<br><br>  - <u>NOMINATION STAGE:</u> You could also call that the selection phase. We ask YOU to submit on the forum’s dedicated thread 5 players that you think did well throughout the year and deserve the award, and the 5 players with the most appearances out of all the submissions will qualify for the next phase.<br><br>  - <u>FINAL VOTING:</u> A poll is organized where the community decides who wins the award, out of the 5 players chosen from the Nomination stage. As simple as that.<br>And all I have left to say is: Go Vote! (After finishing reading my news ofc you don’t just leave the table at lunch with your plate still full)<br><br><br>So, let me start off with... Well, the News section of the News Update. How fitting. Since 2021 just ended, I think it’s the best time to review not only what happened in the past month, but everything we’ve done this year. Did I already say I had way too much time to spend?<br>    So, in January we saw the Rainbow Road glitch being pulled off for the first time in History by Arthur (not me smh) after 5 years of knowing its existence, thanks to the discovery of new strategies like the use of the Quacker. A month later, a new, RTA-viable way of glitching KC would be discovered and the goat Justin was the first person to pull it off just 2 days after. In April and after months of grinding, the one and holy RaF_Guy was gifted by the Gods an insane 3/3 KingAlex run on MC No-Glitch that cut .5 out of the old record. Benny strat was implemented around that time on MT glitch which brought the track down like 10 seconds, and on the No-Glitch side of KC we got in May the first Korean WR achieved by Jongwoo (get on the site please we’re cool just like u). Then Luke just wanted to TT rDS in peace but Logan pulled a Logan and forced him to implement the shroomless dock cut to get his WR back. Luke then destroyed the track with it.<br><br>    Also Logan got at least one WR every month this year and is the first ever to do so. Cool I guess<br><br>    And I might as well include some worthy mentioning subs that we got this year… Niyake broke into the 15 second territory on GV in February, Logan took down the poor McRaren on WGM and subbed 32, Justin brought DDR down to a 1:46 and rDH to a 1:30, Invincible almost entirely skipped 41 seconds on DKJP, Logan (again) crushed rDKM with the first 2:04 and Blake did not get the 1:44 on DK’s Snowboard Cross.<br><br>“Yeah cool but what happened, like, this month??? Because that’s what the News’s supposed to be about dumbass” I hear you say and don’t worry it comes<br><br>In December we first saw NMeade get some new streaming/recording stuff for better quality content, nyeah<br><br>Then not too much happened lately, people still talk shit about each other in our discord servers and Lowercase is still screaming with his keyboard everytime someone gets a PR that's slightly above average and actually got temporarily banned (or idk what's the latest feature they added) from Bynt's information server because of that. Just your common MKW life going on.<br><br>Also December was the month of Australia, our upside-down friends have been crushing it recently beating many of their country records, congrats to them (I want that to happen to France so badly but we're so few that it'll not happen for like 4 years or something)<br><br>And on the WRs’ side, we got to a total of 101 WRs this year by getting 9 in December: Kaede got a 2:24.589 on RR, Luke was so proud of completing No Nut November that he decided to double down and pass DDD “Destroy Delfino December”, getting the track to a 2:03.525 in the end, Logan pulled KC glitch off and got a 2:11.015 (not a 2:10, bad), Jyran toppled the king Niyake 3 times on GV and finished with a crazy 15.796 (Australian WRs let’s go, fun fact since 2010 every WR from Australia have been set on this category… okay it's just Ejay and Jyran but still), Kasey enlarged his lead on rPB No-Glitch with a 1:12.678, Kenny Mars got his BC3 No-SC Flap WR back from Luke who got mad and took the SC one, and Blake couldn’t get the DKS 1:44 so he improved the Flap instead. And that’s everything we got this month!<br><br><br>Another year of TTs is upon us. What will it bring? Who will we meet? Who will rise to the top? Where will we be entering 2023? When will Arvo stop being a degen? When will I stop making essays about an old game made for children?  …Oh wait those last 2 will never happen<br>What will the future look like? Who knows… Maybe someone knows? That’s why I opened the “Predictions for January 1st, 2023” thread on the board. Go try and predict the future, maybe you’ll be right…<br><br><br>Well then, I think that’s enough for an INTRODUCTION. (help I think I’m realizing this News will be way too long even for me)<br>Time to enter the heart of the matter, “da big stuff” as the wise say<br><br><br>QUOTE OF THE MONTH: <i>\"M8 can probably eat anyone out here\"</i> - Daniel the Maniel (sorry I couldn't find better)<br><br><br>BIBLE QUOTE OF THE MONTH: <i>“Let beer be for those who are perishing, wine for those who are in anguish!”</i> - Proverbs 31:6 (I’m gonna need a good beer if I want to survive writing that News) (yes I’m a minor)<br><br><br><i>This News Update covers from December 4th to December 31st, 2021</i><br><br><br>We count 19 New Players this month: <br><br><font color=lime>Jadid (benvenuto nel sito)<br>NITROFOX (am I supposed to scream it or what)<br>Lucariorip (Did you just lose to Cynthia or something)<br>Lilih (Just added a random letter to her name to fit the 5 character minimum)<br>André C.

Unbelievable. Still congrats for the 3/3 though, it’s well deserved!<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Jack Gluesing</font> got to work on rWS this month and improved to a low 1:51 with a 35.734 Flap that’s 10th, great stuff as always<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Danny Gallenberger</font> entered the top 10 this month by kicking out ZedR! He got an rSL glitch run as well as some other improvements like rMR 1:42.4 and DKS 1:49, Totom in #9 is still quite far but you have what it takes to beat him I’m sure, keep it up<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The Myths (11-50)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#12 Vincent Nguyen</font> also got a 1:49 on DKS but most of all he showed everyone that he wasn’t only good at glitching GV2 and could drive it like a god as well, getting a sweet 52.901 and 16.482 Flap. Now go get that 52.8!<br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Bynt</font> literally JUST passed Doom like 5 hours ago. Last time I checked he was 14th. He changed his discord pfp because we’re in winter (nice one btw), added like 50 (that is to say 3) new channels on his server for various tops and played the totally not useless category of WGM no turnskip but it’s okay because he still played tracks like DC with a 1:29.6 and… DKS with a 1:49 again. I guess it’s the winter track lmao (btw congrats on not being the slowest 1:50 on WGM anymore since you improved and passed Kaao)<br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Jake Harrison</font> the #1 Canadian player only improved one time being DK Mountain with a 2:07.444. Sadly he couldn’t get himself a 1:49 on DKS just like everyone else but it’s because he got it 8 months ago<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 Caleb House</font> smashed his way into the top 20 and dropped a ton of PRs including a DKS… 1:51 oh that’s rare, a 1:44.2 on Moonview c’mon man if I can get 1:43 you surely can too go get it, MC3 1:18.6 not bad but sad it misses top 100 by one placement, and rBC 2:32.2 to name a few. Nice improvements, keep up with that flow of improving several tracks like that but please fill out your No-Glitch timesheet you haven’t touched BC3 yet!!!<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Luke Brown</font> literally only set his rDS 3lap and BC3 Flap WRs this month. Some things don’t change and I think his interest for categories he can’t get WR on will remain non-existent sadly. Great job nonetheless, but think about all the AF you could cut by just playing a few tracks…<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Indy Kambeitz</font> got a time on rPG Flap that’s different from his No-SC timesheet so apparently he made the glitch! Congrats! Oh and he also got some notable times like MC3 1:18.4, rMR 1:42.2 and rWS 1:51.8. Nice improvements from the Dutch climbing 4 placements.<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Hydr8ion</font> suffered the age of the stats page and almost didn’t make it to this News because he only improved on No-Glitch categories. He’s lucky I remembered that he improved on CM with a nice 1:57… Also if you have any problems with me being an updater/News writer then blame it on him because he hired me himself<br><br><font color=yellow>#41 Kevin Miller</font> cut 3 placements and got some nice times including a 2:07 DKM, 2:00 rPG, 2:05 rDS and a heavy 1:50.2 on rWS. Great work!<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Phyzothy</font> got a 1:50.5 on DDR and a 2:12.7 on BC late this month, enough to make it in this News Update. I’m sure you can improve some of your times, so go and cut that AF!<br><br><font color=yellow>#47 JMM435</font> is losing more of his country records than ever but shows true sportsmanship by being happy for his competitor(s). That’s what I call a country’s hero. He didn’t stop playing with this though and got some interesting times as he made TF glitch and got 6th WW on the Flap. Sadly on a 3lap level the Portuguese left this year with no new WW top, missing MC glitch by .105 and ending his 5 year streak. Every good thing has an end…<br><br><font color=yellow>#48 Hunter Wells</font> entered top 50 by making the DKJP glitch and getting a time on DKS that’s not 1:49, but better since it’s a 1:48! Congrats and good luck on your future attempts! …That sounded familiar<br><br><font color=yellow>#49 Jacob Loerzel</font> is making me work overtime since he submitted his only PR of the month, from the 11th…  On January 2nd WHEN I’VE ALREADY FINISHED THE NEWS. You’re lucky I went to sleep at 1:30AM and didn’t finish in time!!! What was the time he submitted though I don’t even recall let me check oh it’s a 34.815 on CM okay not bad not bad you just beat me by 21 seconds lmfao my time’s a 56.017 from over a year ago. Well, great job at making it in the News, just in time…<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The Legends (51-100)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#63 Ultra_Pear</font> is experiencing the strange thing that we call a life and only got a 1:53 on rWS this month. Or maybe he’s recovering from the News he had to write? We’ll probably never know…<br><br><font color=yellow>#65 Mo No</font> only submitted one PR this month (yesterday exactly as of writing this so the 31st), a 1:52.088 on rWS. Not bad, not bad.<br><br><font color=yellow>#67 Claus</font> is updating faster than the speed of light but I can still outrun him… When he's sleeping. Hey, that's his fault you're not allowed to know sleep when you're an updater! Jokes aside, the wheeler got the Parkway glitch, a 1:51.1 on DDR and an rSL No-Glitch flap of 40.535 this month. Can't believe he got more time to play than me even when he updates 10 times more…<br><br><font color=yellow>#68 Alberto Barba</font> went a little too far and passed too many people so he's not #69 and that makes it a really bad month for the Peruvian. You shouldn't have gotten a 2:18 on Maple with a 44.3 Flap smh!!! Oh and he also played BC No-SC this month, lowering his PB to a 2:23.5, and DKS, sadly only getting a 1:50.3. Still good if you ask me… but the eternal question I'll have with you guys is how tf you set all of this with the damn wheel. Y'all are crazy.<br><br><font color=yellow>#74 Shane Hogan</font> probably got his 2021 highlight this month by setting an insane 32.371 on CM glitch, that's 5th WW (4th here since Takemi's not registered). That's a massive time, big congrats Shane! On a side note, he got a 2:12 on BC and a 1:30.5 on DC, not bad at all.<br><br><font color=yellow>#78 Nate Schultz</font> is a lazy updater and probably played more than he updated, what a useful co-worker he is :) still he's still climbing the ranks even after his big breakthrough a few months ago, with a shy 1:19.3 on MC3 (go get that 1:18 you're top 80 nothing can stop you!!!!), a better 1:50.6 DKS coupled with a 35.4 Flap, and a good 1:22.5 on MC No-Glitch. I wonder how far all of that \"PP next gen\" (Nate, Claus, Hydr8ion, Pear, Ben, even me lol) will go, we can surely do some damage to the tops, and you too Nate just like what you've already done on MT. Best of luck in 2022 to everyone from βτ!<br><br><font color=yellow>#79 Watcha</font> only got 2 PRs, a 35.1 on DKS Flap and a nice 2:17.8 on BC3 No-SC. A grind for EU tops at a .4 is in the works maybe? Would be cool to see you get on that one… <br><br><br><font color=red><u>The Kings (101-200)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#107 ArthurOww</font> got lost on TF the whole month and didn’t even get French Tops on it so he improved another track instead where the tops were free, MG No-Glitch. I got a 1:42.4 that’s like 8th French to keep my streak of months with new French tops that’s been going since August. I’m currently working on MMM but I suck because I can’t make the low on the ramp, at least I got a little improvement on the flap with a mid 24.0 but I’d want a 23 and get that damn 1:16 that’s so easy I can’t even get it.<br><br><font color=yellow>#126 Neptune</font> is actually #124 at the time of writing this but 2022 PBs don't count sorry :P he's been on a roll recently, cutting 8 placements from #134 and setting many PRs including DKM 2:04 and 2:08 No-Glitch, a 59.7 on rYF and a few flaps. Great job, keep going, and little surprise Pear forgot in the last News to mention the POTW/POTM awards, you were in there for your rWS achievements! I hope I'll be able to mark it on the site today.<br><br><font color=yellow>#136 Samuel W</font> only got 2 PRs, a 1:58.8 on CM and a 1:52 on DDR. Nice times as always, keep going the No-SC top 100 is just around the corner!<br><br><font color=yellow>#142 Jadid</font> is our only timesheeter of the month, welcome again<br><br><font color=yellow>#151 Sebastian Manson</font> also got many PRs this month and cut 12 placements. Highlights include a 2:33.3 on rBC, 53.5 on GV2 and a 2:23 on KC, great stuff from the Canadian.<br><br><font color=yellow>#156 Jyran Liebs</font> GV WR GV WR GV WR GV WR GV WR GV WR and also DKS mid 1:50 and DDR 1:49 great stuff keep it up! You're gonna have to improve your weaker tracks as well though if you want to move up the ranks fast… Or maybe learn what a Flap is.<br><br><font color=yellow>#161 Acquiesce</font> improved his rSGB Oceanian record to a 1:21 (actually huge, congrats man), subbed 1:58.5 on CM and got a 1:53 on DDR. Good stuff as always<br><br><font color=yellow>#189 Blake Germany</font> got his flap WR and nothing else as he's only playing DKS. The grind lives on, as the buisness stays unfinished… All of us pray for the 1:44 barrier to fall asap, you're basically the only one in this world that can make it fall so make us dream Mr. DKS<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The Heros (201-300)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#212 Ben Hurley</font> went to DDR this month and improved to a low 1:54, not bad not bad<br><br><font color=yellow>#219 Benjamin Brophy</font> or βτ Ben or the βτ mascot or the Better Ben (even though he's not the best Ben since there's Hurley right above him) improved on a few tracks including rBC and WGM No-Glitch to 2:34.3 and 1:53.6 respectively, one day you'll truly be the Better Ben I'm sure so keep going bro!<br><br><font color=yellow>#227 Ben Busche</font> is pulling through like a boss to catch up on his Ben competitors, with 23 placements cut and 10 PRs this month which include a 2:10 on DKM (...beats me lmao), 1:53 on DKS and a satisfying 1:19.997 on MC3 congrats on sub!<br><br><font color=yellow>#228 Joe Beaton</font> got 9th EU on DDR with a 1:48.5, huge time man congrats from the other side of the English Channel (in France we call it \"La Manche\" it's completely different what the hell)<br><br><font color=yellow>#234 Brian Lai</font> was busy the whole month but still managed to pour out an improvement on Goldmine for the first time in like 6 months, to a 1:51.2. the dream of Regs never dies, I hope you'll break through on your track man<br><br><font color=yellow>#252 Alex Friedman</font> cut 5 placements with 6 improvements, top 250 is close but it wasn't for 2021 sadly… Well it would've been if he actually played some flaps. Everytime it's the flaps. He still set really notable times this month, including a 2:05 on rSL, mid 1:51 on DKS, 1:30 on DC and 1:51.7 on WGM wow I'm impressed just play flaps and you'll move up like 100 ranks bro<br><br><font color=yellow>#254 Elias</font> got 5 PRs but still lost a placement what the fuck. A notable time is a 1:16.6 on MMM that's his first No-Glitch 3lap top 100, congrats on that!<br><br><font color=yellow>#262 Cederic</font> improved… 19 categories okay that's big, he cut 25 placements with it that's bigger, and he got the DKJP glitch with a 1:54 that was his first German Tops (that's even bigger) but he got kicked out apparently (bruh I don't think you even lasted a week, sad). But he's not done yet! The Gaming Drummer is trying to get into another German Top, a No-Glitch one to say the least (I'm so proud of you No-Glitch is life): Peach Beach. He's close, he got a 1:13.788 a few days ago where 10th German is… a 1:13.742 just go man you got this we all believe in you! And with Don Capri's help I'm sure you'll get it in no time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#281 Freddy Funny</font> got 15 PRs but apparently lost 5 placements. Okay stats page<br><br><font color=yellow>#287 Xenophanes</font> is I believe one of the only karters remaining to use the board's thread to submit times instead of the Discord channel. Thanks for keeping this 20+ years-old site alive! He got 7 PRs and cut 8 placements, the highlight being in my opinion a 2:19 on BC3. I know some people in top 100 that can't say they subbed 2:20 on that track… Yeah I'm looking at you dead in the eyes Pear.<br><br><font color=yellow>#290 Woomy</font> cut 4 placements with 5 PRs, with a DKS 1:51 that I felt was notable enough to mention it. Nice nice keep going<br><br><font color=yellow>#292 James Collins</font> couldn't get rid of all his Expert times for 2021. Sadly you missed your goal but if you look at what you've accomplished and how far you went, you'll see that just being a little late for a milestone is honestly nothing. Congrats on your 2021 Karting, even this month you killed it with 17 PRs and 18 placements cut, and you even reached top 300 how cool is that<br><br><font color=yellow>#293 Supreme</font> got 2 PRs… and lost 2 spots. People in that part of the leaderboard are on fire right now I suppose. He went to work on MG No-Glitch mainly, lowering his time to a 1:43, good job<br><br><br>Help me this nightmare isn't ending it's 10PM here and I gotta finish this today I'm gonna perish (I NEED MY BEER)<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The... Others (300+)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#370 Ncsr.</font> takes the lead on his rival Johnson Turkey and moves to being 7 AF ahead instead of 5, and 3 placements ahead instead of one.<br><br><font color=yellow>#373 Johnson Turkey</font> keeps the pressure though and doesn't give up with 3 new PRs this month, but not enough to contain the 7 PRs that his rival got. \"The Turkey slips but never falls\" as the wise say (yes I just invented that so what are you gonna do about it), an interesting battle that we've been seeing throughout 2021 and that I'll be honoured to comment on in News Updates in 2022.<br><br><font color=yellow>#404 Neo</font> not found. The stats page tells me he got a PR but when I check his player page the last PR is from May 2020 so I don't know if the Portuguese played or not sadly. He probably played considering there was like 5 times more activity in Portugal than ever before but I have no idea. Good job if you PB’d I guess…<br><br><font color=yellow>#426 Thomas Kraiser</font> got 3 PRs and still lost 2 placements, that's often the case in the lower parts of the leaderboard sadly.<br><br><font color=yellow>#458 Vincent Kwiecien</font> got 2 PRs but instead moved up 2 placements. I don't understand Math. And I chose Math as a speciality at school too what is this<br><br></font><font color=yellow>#504 James Woods</font> didn't move any ranks with his 2 PRs, he rather lost 2 AF. Sad.

May everyone improve.<br><br>Welcome, Karters, Kartesses, in this News Update.<br><br>As you see I managed at least this time to fulfill your wishes and maintain a monthly News… Honestly I don’t know if I’m gonna be able to hold that pace for the whole year, but I’ll do my best to achieve such a milestone when so many of my News-Writing colleagues have failed in doing so.<br><br>Come, take a seat. I have some coffee or tea for you, to keep you warm. As the windows show an endless white rain in the dark sky of that Moonless night, let me tell you the story of those who chase perfection… Also known as, Time Trialers.<br><br>May I start with the results of the recent poll I made for the election of the Player of the Year. Without any surprise... Logan wins it and joins Martin Fox as the only players that have won this award more than once. More details on the results, notably the placement of the other nominees, are on the Awards page.<br><br>The Time Trialers broke a total of 16 World Records in January. That, is the most we've seen in quite some time… As you would have to go back to April of 2020 to find a better month for the TT scene, with 18 WRs broken.<br><br>This month saw the discovery of a pretty… unusual thing might I say. I mean, it’s not everyday that a No-Glitch track that has been driven the same way for years gets a new, almost simpler strategy that saves time compared to the old one. Wario’s Gold Mine was thus blown wide open by Justin when he took the right path near the end of the track and got 2nd WW with it, missing WR by 2 milliseconds. By seeing this achievement, many players have attempted to improve with the strat. Resulted from that many new 1:50s, low 1:51s and a total of 7 WRs by Luke and Justin himself just in January. This game might be old but I’m not worried about it dying anytime soon, our community’s insane.<br><br>The man who speaks glitches, Champion Logan, apparently took the glitch variation of the track for the No-Glitch one, as he played and improved his glitch time after the new strat was discovered. Realizing his mistake, he then went on to play the right category but sadly didn’t take the top spot at any time.<br><br>The Great yet Young Jyran runs further and further away from the Japanese Master Niyake on GV, bringing down the category to a 15.673. Is the King of the Rock toppled for good? Ones say so, others are more restrictive. I believe that, as seen on many tracks and as proven by many players, everything is possible. Jyran also got his first Flap WR alongside his improvements with a 3.067. Legend in the making or simple shooting star, only time will tell…<br><br>On the other side of the track, Barney improved his own WR further into the 1:51.3 territory, with a flipping 1:51.360. He later improved again, by 2 milliseconds. However the Contract of the Player’s Page must be followed and respected, thus one who has been banned shall remain banned for eternity. <br><br>Ownership of MG Glitch remains in the hands of Bryce, as he improved yet again the WR on his category with a 20.132. His now 2-year reign seems to not be going down anytime soon… Nevertheless, it might be good to remind everyone that there’s a $500 bounty held by Phyzothy for anyone that can end this reign. This might get the attention of some people, who knows…<br><br>Non-Site player Kasey expanded his WR collection by topping everyone on the other beach track, Shy Guy Beach. From 3 milliseconds away to 3 milliseconds ahead, our runner-up for the POTY award took down the oldest and only 1000+ days old WR we had, one set by Sosis in early 2019, to claim his title of multi-WR holder. I would say, if you ever plan on going on vacation, the best plan is to ask him to grant you a discount for some time on the beach…<br><br>There are people that would've stopped trying long ago. People that would've quitted out of exhaustion. People that would've never TTed again. But he did not. He continued, and after 3 whole years and his massive WR choke, he got his 2nd chance... And he did not miss it. The Curry master, I call Emil Parappuram, finally claimed his first WR on BC3, taking it away from Braixen with a 2/3 shroomless shortcut run. A wise man once said: \"If you hit a pace once, you're likely to hit it again\"... This story really is the perfect example to support that statement.<br><br>They may be underplayed but still greatly deserve to be mentioned. We had some movement at Top-Level for flaps as well, as German player Paul K got his first WRs on MG No-Glitch this month, beating Daniel’s WR first by 2 milliseconds with a time of 31.260 then further by 10 milliseconds to finish the month with a 31.250, then Kenny M pushed his newly acquired BC3 No-SC WR further and into the 44.2 territory and Felix G blew his old rDKJP No-Glitch WR away, first with a small improvement to a 41.749 then by almost .2 with a time of 41.572. Oldest Flap in the WR timesheet remains Liam’s rDH No-SC time of 29.317 that’s been our top time since January 30th, 2016, followed very closely by Justin’s 4.251 CM Glitch from February 21st, 2016. Both are the only 2000+ days old WRs we have and the last remaining 2016 World Records. <br><br>You could say that the most active ones in January were the Australians. The momentum they got from December persisted through this month, as even though they did not break many records they still were very active and many of them improved their times. I think I will make this a recurring section in our dear News Updates just like the quote of the month… Sadly I will have to take away the monster that is the US, for obvious reasons being overrepresentation and sheer dominance on the scene. Let the minorities express themselves!<br><br>...And speaking of the recurring sections.<br><br><u>TRACK OF THE MONTH:</u> <i>Wario's Gold Mine</i> with no surprise. Everyone has been working on it ever since Justin came out with his new strat. Bynt sure is glad rSGB didn't take the spot.<br><br><u>QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u> <i>\"Nicaragua\"</i> - JMM<br><br>Allow me to replace the holy quote Arvo implemented a few months ago, with something a little more… Related, to the topic we're discussing. The flower that blooms never forgets the seed it started from...<br><br><u>ANCIENT QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u> <i>\"I'm too lazy to post a detailed argument, so I'll just say this: Mario Kart is serious business.\"</i> - Michael Fried, November 18th, 2009<br><br><i>This News Update covers from January 1st to January 31st, 2022</i><br><br><font color=\"lime\">We count 7 New Players this month: <br><br>Princessje11ybean (...Interesting username)<br>Henry Wheeler (Wouldn't be bold to assume he plays with the wheel)<br>Davis Gollert (Literally played 0 flaps)<br>DarthNico (Vader's twin I suppose)<br>ElecTrick (That’s not how you spell electricity)<br>Falco (Australian KFC)<br>Antoni Gąsiorowski (I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone from Poland play this game)</font><br><br>As someone who's greatly attached to the No-Shortcut rankings, I'll from now on, for each player, include their No-SC placement in red alongside their main combined placement in blue. The No-Glitch ranking isn't taken into account in the following leaderboard however, and the players are ordered based on the Combined rankings as always. It’s just an add-on for the comparison.<br><br><font color=red><u>The Leaders (1-10)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#1</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#2</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Logan Kebabby</font> is our first Time Trialer on the list. Apart from his WGM WR mentioned previously, he went to improve MMM this month, getting a 1:15.7 and 23.8 flap, and on rSGB where he got really close to WW tops, being only 17ms off of ZeldaCubed in 10th place. Not to mention he also played some No-Glitch on WGM and managed to hit a 1:50.444.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#4</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#7</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Arvo Koskikallio</font> followed the crowd and brought his WGM No-Glitch down to a 1:50 and the flap to a 35.5, using the Justin strat. As he doesn't update times anymore I see he has more time to update his driving, good thing that is <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#8</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#22</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Jack Gluesing</font> only broke one single PR this month, by pulling off the glitch on rSL. Improving on a category like this always is a great achievement, so congrats!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#10</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#17</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Vincent Nguyen</font> got one of these PR streaks that you always want to get when you're close to a certain milestone. By breaking 13 of his records this month he kicked the recently installed Danny out of the top 10. I cannot wait to see if a battle for that #10 spot occurs, and if it does I don't think Totom will remain a top 10 for much longer...<br><br><font color=red><u>The Wise (11-50)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#11</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#39</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Danny Gallenberger</font> suffered from the breakout of Vincent and lost his Top 10 placement after only having it for about a month. What also caused this fall is the fact that he only broke one single PR, being rPG with a 1:59 that ties Jared2K. As good as it is, one improvement isn’t enough, as consistency is valued more than performance when you talk about AF. I think he’s gonna fight back though, after the weeks he spent trying to reach that top I’m sure he’d want to stay installed up there for longer.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#12</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#15</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">ZedR</font> only got one PR being a 2:28 on RR. The former top 10 still has a few tricks up his sleeve, we'll see if he has the will to grind that placement again. That top is gonna be very disputed this year...<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#13</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#13</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Bynt</font> has been unwilling to implement the Justin strat on WGM for absolutely no reason. He did manage a 1:50.880 by the time it wasn’t discovered that was 6th WW but he’s now long gone from tops. Embrace the novelty, the meta evolves as you should be evolving with it! It should probably help for getting that Total Time Top 10 that you’re aiming for lately, as much as playing DDR for a 1:48.7 did…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#16</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#23</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Jake Harrison</font> went to improve on his weaker tracks this month, more precisely on LC and RR with a 1:09.6 and 2:30.0 respectively. Will the Canadian ace be able to pull through? Again one of the few things to look forward to this year...<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#18</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#14</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Nick Meade</font> proved that you can always improve your times further even when you’ve been Time Trialing for 10 years. With no new strats, our favorite MKW streamer finally got himself a 1:49 on DKS alongside a 1:50.9 with the new strats on WGM.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#21</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#18</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Dane Allen</font> went to rDH and improved his time with a 1:35.5. Sadly not enough to have an AF loss, he gained 0.04 and didn’t move any spots.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#23</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#3</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Luke Brown</font>, finally, actually listened to me and played (probably for the first time) categories he will almost certainly never have WR on. Better late than never as we say. The Bot improved his DKS to a 1:48, his RR to a 2:27.3 with Flame Runner, and his rSL to a 2:04.7, not to mention his push on WGM we discussed earlier. While not really up to WR standards these times are really good just like the rest of your timesheet, and in my honest opinion it’s better to have times such as those rather than rushed and unfinished ones… Keep that up Luke.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#30</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#50</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">MKRFirestone</font> kept his interest for the scene at least for one more month after not playing for almost the entirety of 2021 according to his timesheet. He only broke one of his PRs being on rBC with a 2:32.6. I wonder how long he’ll stay… Oh, sorry, I forgot you can never retire from this game.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#37</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#31</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Fatality</font> skyrocketed on the leaderboard this update, getting from #45 to #37. He first improved his rWS with a 1:50.6 and a flap that’s 5th WW. He then went for a few flaps including BC3 No-SC (and how could you lose to me on that, you’re on EU tops in 3lap I’m sure you can improve that flap to at least a low .5, go) and finished just like everyone with improvements on WGM, except he stood out from the others quite a lot as he got himself up to WW tops. Unfortunately this feat only lasted a few days, as this top changes faster than Claus updates recently. But no matter how long it lasted, getting WW tops on any track still is something that only a few people can brag about.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#43</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#52</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Phyzothy</font> improved a lot of his PRs and cut 3 placements. Some highlights include a mid 2:19 on MT, 1:13.8 on rPB and a 1:36.7 on rDH. Pretty good stuff, keep up that momentum<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#47</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#62</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">JMM435</font> improved his rMR to a 1:43.4, and as you’re probably used to by now, he also played WGM and got himself a 1:51. It’s nice to see you succeeding in No-Glitch as well, excelente trabalho<br><br><font color=red><u>The Scholars (51-100)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#63</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#69</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Ultra_Pear</font> improved on TF with a mid 1:51 and rMC with a low 1:32, found a dead fish in his workplace’s parking lot that nobody seems to really care about apart from him, and is currently making some progress towards a legendary 1:59 on rPG. Best of luck for you my friend, go get that sub I know you can do it!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#67</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#60</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Claus</font> played an Online TT event with me and got 2nd place just behind Lee Duggan while I was dying in every race and hardly got 5th. GGs mate, hopefully I can play in these more in the coming weeks. On the Offline TT side everyone’s favorite updater apparently isn’t cursed like me on DDR because he got a 1:50, alongside a low 1:23 on rSGB and the mandatory improvement on WGM with a 1:51.7. Yet, he failed to actually get a decent time on BC3 No-SC. You can legit cut 2 seconds off of your 2:20, I’m useless when it comes to tips on Wii Wheel but I can at least give you some advice about the track itself if you need to, my door (and by that I mean my DMs) is always open!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#68</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#76</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Shane Hogan</font> broke many of his PRs to break into top 70 this month. Highlights include 2:32 rBC, 1:22.0 MC, 2:01 rDKM, 34 Glitch and 1:52 No-Glitch WGM (this last one without the use of the new strat as it was driven before its discovery). Great stuff, may this momentum last long.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#69</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#46</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Alberto Barba</font> lost one placement thanks to Shane and is now where he always needed to be, #69. The Peruvian played DDR for a 1:50, BC for a 2:23.1, BC3 No-SC for a 2:18 and WGM for a 1:52.3 most notably. Great job as always.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#75</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#124</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Nate Schultz</font> cut 3 placements with 3 PRs submitted to his Combined Timesheet, whose being a 1:16.8 on MMM, 34.3 on WGM and 43.3 Flap on BC. However he also pleased me by working on his No-Glitch timesheet, getting his BC to a mid 2:23 and, most of all, a 43.9 Flap on MT that’s 6th WW. Congrats my dear updating friend! Also, I might not understand it, but nevertheless… Baja Life.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#78</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#51</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Watcha</font> got there? A simple 24.0 Flap on MMM. Enough to bring him up by one placement apparently. I’ll quote my Math teacher while changing a few words… ”A good Time Trialer is a Time Trialer that spares their efforts”. Nice job.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#83</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#38</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Kasper</font> apparently decided to play this game without itemboxes again and got a 1:56 on CM, 2:20 on KC and 1:51.3 on WGM. The inner TTer that’s buried deep in himself seems to resurface, and that’s a pretty good thing if you ask me…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#89</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#61</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">ArthurOww</font> played a dozen of flaps alongside MMM with a 1:16, rMC3 with a 1:18.5 that’s his monthly French Top and finally decided to actually work on rDKM, cutting his PR by 1.5 seconds with a 2:09.4 that’s not even optimized because it’s a 2:08 fail. Next track I’m working on is, with no surprise, WGM, but I’m way too bad at this track and, added with the fact that I’m pretty rusty on it and can’t make wallbounce consistently, getting French Tops at a 1:52.3 is gonna be a little more difficult than others thought it would be. Might have to call for help just like I had to with rMC3…<br><br><font color=red><u>The Disciples (101-200)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#114</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#104</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Neptune</font> made it into another glitch WW Top this month with a 1:45.9 on TF! Our Litten enthusiast also broke many PRs this month with most notably a 2:02.0 on rDKM, 38.5 on CM, 1:51.4 on the No-SC variation of TF, and 1:51.8 on WGM as everyone else. Even a little kitten can deal impressive amounts of damage…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#119</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#131</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Kjeld van Keulen</font> took the turn to LC this month and got himself a 1:09.8 that’s probably his sub alongside an impressive 21.910 Flap! Great job with that.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#133</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#105</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Samuel W</font> or as I like to call him “No-Glitch Top 100 when” (seriously the man got to like #102 when I wasn’t even #110, now I’m #61 and he didn’t move at all) played nothing to get the top 100 this month as he only submitted a Flap on GV… Glitch. A 5.3 to be more precise. That’s cool and all but you’re so close to that top it’s like 12 AF away and if I managed to cut 15 AF this month at my level with honestly little time to play I’m sure you can get that in no time. So go and get that W to fit your name!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#147</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#96</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Acquiesce</font> entered top 100 in No-Glitch to prove he doesn’t need to clip trees or go through walls to be good, excellent. He continued his efforts from last month in rSGB where he brought his 1:21 to a low .9, and also played rSL for a 2:05, RR for a 2:31 and rPG for a low 2:01, not to mention a 1:57.1 CM, 2:18.9 rBC3 and 1:51.8 WGM on the No-Glitch exclusive side. A month filled with great improvements, and 14 placements cut on the Combined rankings, hope the momentum stays with you throughout February!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#156</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Idriz</font> improved his already 2nd WW Flap on MG glitch. That’s all. Also he’s the first one we encounter without a complete No-Glitch timesheet, maybe add that to your TT schedule…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#157</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Jyran Liebs</font>, as opposed to last month, only worked on GV, pushing the 3lap to a 15.6 and getting WR on Flap with a 3.067. Niyake still hasn’t fought back… I would give him a little more time, but I think he’ll answer. The Labies Man may be a prodigy, but Niyake is a God amongst the GV Gods. We’ll see how that plays out.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#169</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#73</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Kenneth Bernales</font> is even purer than me when it comes to not playing Combined-only categories. The man doesn’t even have a WGM time as his newly acquired 1:53.005 shows up in both charts. What stands out for him this update is a 1:54.0 on rWS and a 1:42.6 on MG. Great stuff dear No-Glitch enjoyer. <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#172</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">NRStar</font> broke his old rMC 3lap PR with a 1:33.2, but that’s far from being the highlight of his month… After getting his first 2:17 on his Ace Track, Maple Treeway, he put his hands on the Flap and got a 43.9 that’s 7th WW. The joy of pulling through on a track you love is, in my eyes, one of the best feelings you can ever have in this game. And I speak from experience. Great job on these times!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#174</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#133</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Nara Hiero</font> made his glorious return to the scene after taking a break in August. The Canadian LC lover pushed his BC3 shortcut to a 2:04, pretty nice time, it even beats me… Nice to see you again, good luck on your future TTs my friend!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#185</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#95</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Shawn Berry</font> doesn’t Time Trial that much these days but still took the time to implement the new Justin strat, getting a 1:50.7 on WGM with it that I believe was WW Tops when set just a week ago. This top changes so fast… Congrats on the time though.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#195</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#87</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Kenny M</font> improved his BC3 Flap WR as we discussed earlier, and technically didn’t submit anything else to the Page but we all know he improved his 3lap to a low 2:16.5 and inches closer to the holy 1st WW time. I have no clue if he is currently grinding for it, or even considering grinding for it though…<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The Followers (201-300)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#201</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#139</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Blue B#</font> got 4 PRs this month, the highlight being a very fast 2:05.4 on rDS. Almost broke into top 200 for January, hope you get it this month… (We’re the 5th and yes this is foreshadowing.)<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#211</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#135</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Ben Hurley</font> is ahead of our other Ben but lost little ground to him. He cut one placement with his 5 PRs, the highlight being in my opinion a 2:23.0 Shortcut time on BC. The battle rages between our Bens, who will get to #200 first?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#212</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Darien Bawpers</font> improved on 2 different tracks with excellents 33.2 WGM and 37.6 CM, but that wasn’t enough to secure his last placement as he got bopped by Hurley. Also he’s only our 4th Karter without a 64/64 set of No-Glitch times, I’m impressed and very pleased about that, I thought there was going to be many more of them…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#218</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#149</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Ben Brophy</font> got less PRs than his Ben rival yet he cut more AF than him. These surely were consequent improvements… MC3 1:19.1, rWS 1:54 and DKS 1:53. Not bad at all, with a No-Glitch addition of 1:44.0 MG and mid 1:55 GV it’s a pretty decent month for our βτ mascot. Keep it up!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#226</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#138</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Joe Beaton</font> improved his DDR from last month on New Year’s Day alongside his Flap with a 34.0. You’re faster than a McLaren (or even a… McRaren) on that track, nice job<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#252</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#134</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Alex Friedman</font> is another “Luke wannabe” that strictly only plays No-Glitch categories. He broke his MT and WGM PRs this month with a 2:19.9 and 1:51.5 respectively, great stuff but please don’t be a “Zane wannabe” and actually play Flaps, you’d be so high up there if you did…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#259</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#181</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Cederic</font> took a break from rPB to aim his attention on other tracks… And he surely did. A total of 15 improvements and 3 placements cut in Combined, with most notably a 2:21.5 on the Shortcut variation of BC. The ardor of the new player breaking his records across all his timesheet, cutting AF, climbing ranks and improving… This brings me some memories. Enjoy your time, and make sure to destroy that German Top on Peach Beach once you come back to it!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#265</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#159</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Spencer Sassak</font> has every single time in his timesheet that’s dated to June 12th, 2021… And then there’s BC with the flap that’s from June 30th and the 3lap that’s from this month. I wonder what he likes to play… He got a 2:11.7 too, great time.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#269</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#175</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Parker Johnson</font> cut 10 placements for 8 PRs, including a mid 1:44 on rMR and a 45 on WGM. Good times, keep it up<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#274</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#180</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Xenophanes</font> got 8th in the Online TT event I played with Claus. Consistency is key, as we’ve always stated and continue to claim on the Player’s Page, and playing for AF is the best way to improve your consistency, to later perform in events like this. So keep it up! Improving your worst times, like you did this month with your 1:19.7 on MC3 or your 1:44.5 on rMR, is the way to go if you want to have a balanced and consistent timesheet. Best of luck in your future sessions.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#277</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#150</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Freddy Funny</font> achieved extremely good times for his ranking this month, with a 1:49 on DDR and a 1:22 on rSGB. Congrats… But please, work on your flaps. I think you could legitimately get to top 100 No-Glitch if you had flaps the same level as your 3laps instead of that mediocre timesheet.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#282</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#188</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">James Collins</font> got 13 PRs and cut 10 placements this month. A 1:52.9 on TF, 2:25 on BC and 1:22.6 on MC felt like worth mentioning, especially the latter that’s his 2nd best-ranked 3lap No-Glitch time after his Ace Track rSGB. Great job! Also might I ask, when is that DDR flap being broken, it’s your last Expert Standard left in No-Glitch… Go and get that 35.7!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#287</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#179</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Woomy</font> broke 6 PRs and cut 3 placements, with a really good 1:51.4 on DKS standing out. I think it’s safe to say that, even with a 1:42 on MG or a 1:22.8 on MC… Blake’s Track is your Ace Track. Am I right?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#290</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#170</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Supreme</font> improved on 3 different tracks with a 2:03.8 on BC3, 1:43.3 on rMC and 1:53.7 on WGM, cutting 3 placements with that just like Woomy. Unfortunately we cannot talk about a “supreme improvement” yet… See you when you get your first World Record I suppose<br><br><font color=red><u>The Common Folks (300+)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#301</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#205</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Will Fury</font> got 2 PRs but lost AF… However he still cut one placement? As much as I’m into Mathematics these stats don’t make sense sometimes. Making a push towards top 300 would be nice to see, as you’re quite close to say the least. Good luck on that if you decide to go for it.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#323</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#193</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Ivo Bril</font> worked mainly on MMM this month, bringing his PR to a 1:17.7 with a 24.3 flap. After being done with that he took his MG No-Glitch to sub 1:45, not bad from the Dutch.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#331</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#185</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Ragemodepigeon</font> finished his timesheet and just got into the leaderboard. Welcome to the competition!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#335</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">YangMK6</font> seems to like Gordon Ramsay quite a lot as he’s now organizing a Time Trial competition in his honor. Or maybe it’s a competition inside a warring clan or a discord server that’s in his honor, I have no idea. Nonetheless, I think it’s safe to assume that he likes Mr. Ramsay. With the power of the Holy Lamb Sauce he improved on many tracks and cut 20 placements, with highlights being a 1:51.6 on TF, 1:19.2 on MC3 and 2:04.0 on BC3. Good stuff, and on a sidenote I am waiting for Mario Kart 9 to be announced and released so we can see your evil twin brother YingMK9 on its TT scene as well<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#369</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#210</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Ncsr.</font> seems to have pulled through compared to his rival Johnson Turkey when you look at the leaderboard. The placement gap between them increased by 1, and Ncsr broke one more PR than Turkey with a 49.420 on MG being his highlight. However…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#373</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#211</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Johnson Turkey</font> actually cut 3 AF more than his competitor, most notably with a 2:16 on DKJP coupled with a 43 flap, and is now only 4 away from him. The battle is tense between our two players, as only one shall come out victorious. Every journey has its final day. Don’t rush, dear Karters. Appreciate every second of your grind, from your most brilliant moments of success to your most painful defeats. Because a story will never be about its end, but everything that has happened. The memories you’ll make won’t only be from the brightest parts of your journey, but also the darkest. And that will make you appreciate the value of these moments even more.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#392</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#223</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Hugh Moorhead</font> entered top 300 this month with 10 PRs and 14 placements cut. What stands out is the fact that he almost got the 1:09 on LC with a 1:10.008, a thing that’s rarely seen at this relatively low level… For the comparison, I was around #150 when I got it in May last year. Great push, now finish the job and get that sub! Time Trials shall always make the players push themselves to their limits, and beyond.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#423</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#233</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Calum Sutherland</font> got 6 PRs but still lost AF, it’s always like that for those in the lower part of the charts…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#498</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#249</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Charlotte Crego</font> returned to the game after only setting 2 PRs in the last 5 months. Now she has more 2022 PRs in her timesheet than 2021 PRs. That’s what I call a rocket start of a return. Highlights of the month include a 24.3 on GV and a 2:05 on rPG, keep it up Flanders!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#522</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#257</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Ketchup</font> will always remain a UFO in these updates for only playing with automatic… As long as you enjoy it, it’s completely fine. I have no clue how good the times he set this month are since I’ve never used karts with auto drift in my life, but what I can say is that he got 5 PRs and cut 2 placements. However I might ask… Where are Mayonnaise and Mustard? We’ve known you for ages but we still have no sign of them at all.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#551</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#255</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Ashley Taylor</font> is our second timesheeter this Update, enjoy the rankings.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#583</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#282</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Zac Ash</font> glitched MC to get a 1:23.0. He only got that time this month, yet he cut 4 placements and almost 6 AF. Are glitches really that overpowered?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#597</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#269</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Chansey</font> had so much time waiting for its HP bar to run out that it decided to play Mario Kart, getting 14 PRs. Legends say that its HP bar is still way up in the green.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#636</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#289</font>) <font color=\"yellow\">Jack Sahaida</font> is our last active player this update. He broke 3 of his PRs but lost 3 AF, yet he still moved up one rank. That is Math for you.<br><br><font color=red><u>Honorable Mentions:</u></font><br><br>These two sadly didn’t get a full set of times until early February so they couldn’t make it into the leaderboard. However they massively played in January, so I still wanted to acknowledge them.<br><br><font color=\"yellow\">Lawrence</font> missed 7 categories in his timesheet in January to be featured in this News Update. He takes what Core had, that is to say cracked glitch times, and improves the No-Glitch side slightly. Amongst the 3 WW Tops he has on TF, rSL and rWS (all Glitch) he also has times such as RR 2:29.4, DDR 1:51.1, MMM 1:16.5 or CM 1:58.7. He is still far away from having his No-SC Timesheet completed, but if he manages to keep the consistency of the times I just mentioned, he’ll surely gain his spot in the No-Glitch Top 100, or even top 50. He is placed #73 as of today, we’ll see how that goes.<br><br><font color=\"yellow\">Mitchell Healy</font> got really good times for his timesheet this month including rPB 1:11.1, TF 1:48.1, DKS 1:49, RR 2:28 and GV 18.5, for a total of 36 holes filled. Sadly he missed 2 and thus couldn’t enter the leaderboard until a few days into February. As I’m writing this he’s #80 Combined and #91 No-SC.<br><br><br>There, you’ve got every single Time Trialer that left a mark on the Rankings in this past month of January 2022. Everyone has something to say, and everyone should be forever remembered in this holy Karting land, so that those who one day will take the same steps as us in our time, can get the possibility to experience the joy of learning one’s journey and career, admiring it, and take it as an inspiration. This is, in a way, the second purpose of these News Updates… Making sure that our community’s efforts and growth will at all times be remembered. <br><br><font color=#FF1111><u>Take a closer look at this month’s Site Records:</u></font><br><br><font color=yellow>Logan Kebabby </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 0'31\"882 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31\"850</font><br><font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 0'15\"795 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'15\"673</font><br><font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano lap</font> time of 0'03\"120 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'03\"067</font><br><font color=yellow>Emil Parappuram </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser's Castle 3 crs</font> time of 1'57\"291 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'57\"061</font><br><br><font color=#FF1111><u>No-Glitch / No-SC:</u></font><br><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 1’50”579 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1’50”304</font><br><font color=yellow>Paul K </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge lap</font> time of 0'31\"279 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31\"250</font><br><font color=yellow>Kenny M </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GBA Bowser Castle 3 lap</font> time of 0'44\"329 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'44\"291</font><br><font color=yellow>Felix G </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 DK's Jungle Parkway lap</font> time of 0'41\"791 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'41\"572</font><br><br><br><font color=\"green\"><u>PLAYER AWARDS:</u></font><br><br>  - <font color=#00DD66>Player of the Week:</font><br>      January 1: <font color=yellow>Luke Brown</font><br>      January 2: <font color=yellow>Vincent Nguyen</font><br>      January 3: <font color=yellow>Emil Parappuram</font><br>      January 4: <font color=yellow>Martin Fox</font><br><br>  - <font color=#00DD66>Player of the Month:</font> <font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock</font><br><br>  - <font color=#00DD66>Player of the Year:</font> <font color=yellow>Logan Kebabby</font><br><br>Here ends my story for tonight.

Perfect timing to allow me to present to you Karters and Kartesses what you all cherish and wait for every month… Here’s the latest News Update. Unfortunately a pretty short one because I don’t have much time (in fact I have little to no time and it’ll be like that for all of March), but as we say the brightest moments of your life also are the shortest ones…<br><br><br>First off, let me start this update with a warm HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO JMM435 even if it's kinda late since it's the 5th idk how old he turns but go send him some love, he largely deserves it<br><br><br><i>So, what happened in the past month?</i><br><br>Well nothing too crazy on the Karting scene, Nintendo announced DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe that'll be released throughout 2 years until the end of 2023 but who cares since Moonview isn’t in it (yet) (yes this is MH propaganda bc it's the best track in the game)<br><br>Also we might have seen WW3 start with the current situation in Ukraine, our generation really is gifted in terms of dramatic world events<br><br><i><font size=1>They told me not to get political, but all my heart goes to these Ukrainians living a nightmare right now. Hopefully this conflict doesn't turn into something even more dramatic…</font></i><br><br><br>On a more positive note let's talk about the WRs we've seen this past month. I count 10 new 3lap and 4 Flap records since the last News Update, on 8 different categories. Let’s break them down:<br><br>Following the activity in January, Luke and Justin continued to lower the WGM No-Glitch WR, to a 1:50.0 in the end. The 1:49, seemingly unreachable for humans just over a month ago, is pretty much guaranteed to happen with that new “Justin” strat. It’s worth mentioning too that, alongside Luke and Justin, Logan took the WR for the first time himself with a mid .1 on February 9th. Unfortunately Luke reclaimed it 3 days later.<br><br>Former Site member Barney is inching closer and closer to the elusive 1:50 on Grumble, getting the first 1:51.1 on the 8th and beating it again by 10 milliseconds on the first day of March. Place your bets on whenever he’ll get there… I’d say he gets a .0 in June but ends the year without the sub personally<br><br>This man is a W by himself. Winbag4, aka Hunter Wells, finally lands the Waluigi Stadium glitch twice in a run to finish the track in just over a minute and a half. After so much dedication it’s really much deserved. I wonder if the category will still be played as much now that the WR is that hard to get though… We’ll see how that track goes.<br><br>The Demon of Speed returns on his Ace Track once again, to gift us in late February 2 new improvements to his already crazy record on Maple Treeway. With Mii usernames that no one on this planet could read (not even our computers when the ghosts were uploaded to the leaderboards), Demon lowered the track by around 250 milliseconds, first with a low 2:14.3 then to a 2:14.236. Another one of these tracks where you hardly see anyone other than the current WR holder having the top spot… Yet there's been a bit of WW top activity on this track lately, with  Abhilash, Jongwoo and Logan. Will the MT GOAT fall like his track’s leaves or will he stay strong as the giant tree that builds the course? All will be revealed in the next volume of “MKW WR progression”.<br><br>Let’s talk about Flaps for a bit, shall we? Firstly Paul K is apparently addicted to flat times since all his WRs on MG No-Glitch so far finished with a 0. That includes his 31.260, .250 and as of this month, .240. Then Logan, who apparently was bored of doing 3lap runs on WGM, improved Justin’s old No-Glitch WR by over .1 with a 35.380. On the other hand he also took the Glitch Flap from Core with the first 8.8, and the Flap WR sheet updaters have apparently missed the big .2 cut he casually made to the BC3 Shortcut WR, reclaiming it from Luke with a 37.380. That man eats WRs as fast as he eats his kebabs, or even faster and it’s ridiculous<br><br><br>Now onto the Monthly Stuff, honestly my favorite part of the News and that’s why I added/officialised so many over the last 2 News Updates<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=yellow>Italy</font> steals the crown from Australia!

I learned Spear on rPG to get myself my 9th French Top, just barely this time. I’m currently 10th with a 2:00.713 but I aim for at least a .5 and 5th French, beating Nao, Fulag and Shiney. Also Pear will try to kill me if I bop him but I don’t think I’ll get a run as strong as his… For now<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#91</font> (<font color=FF3333>#64</font>) <font color=yellow>Nathan Socholotiuk</font> only played a No-Glitch flap on rGV2, but it’s a banger: 16.4, 14th on the site. Great job on that Boshi<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Established Karters (101-200)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#109</font> (<font color=FF3333>#97</font>) <font color=yellow>Neptune</font> broke into the No-Glitch top 100 this month, congrats! Highlight of this month definitely is that 1:51.3 on WGM, impressive time coming from you, nice job<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#145</font> (<font color=FF3333>#89</font>) <font color=yellow>Acquiesce</font> got the big sub on his Flame Runner’s Ace Track, a 1:34.9 on rDH early in February. Alongside that came some rPG 2:00.5, rBC3 2:18.0, WGM 1:51.4 and rDKJP 2:13.6, a really productive month it was! <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#156</font> (<font color=FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Idriz</font> got a huge 20.403 on MG, inching closer to beating Bryce. Could this run, as good as it is, still be lowered? From what I recall, Idriz himself doesn’t even know. Best of luck nonetheless if you decide to shoot your shot once again.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#162</font> (<font color=FF3333>#156</font>) <font color=yellow>Rheece Wachow</font> cut 18 spots for 17 AF, with his top time this update being a 4.6 Flap on CM that’s #69, great time to add to his collection of Top 100 times. Great progression this month, keep up that pace to reach that top 150 next News Update!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#168</font> (<font color=FF3333>#131</font>) <font color=yellow>Nara Hiero </font>improved on a few categories including rBC, DDR and BC Shortcut. He also managed to hit his long-awaited sub on TF, getting himself a 1:51.8, good job man keep it up!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#172</font> (<font color=FF3333>#128</font>) <font color=yellow>Blue B#</font> blew everyone away and climbed 30 spots. Astonishing work. To achieve such a feat were set times such as 2:22 KC and 2:01.4 rPG, and various flaps to top everything off. Great moves.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#184</font> (<font color=FF3333>#77</font>) <font color=yellow>Kenny M</font> got a 1:50.6 on WGM that’s not WW tops anymore. I’m sure it was when he set it because it was a full month ago. Still a wicked time so congrats anyway, and good luck to reclaim WW Tops if you plan on it<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#185</font> (<font color=FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Joshua Reinshagen</font> was… <font color=#33AADD>#244</font> IN THE LAST NEWS UPDATE. That’s a whole 59 placements and 64 AF cut in the month for 30 PRs. I’ve never seen such a cut before. Welcome in top 200 I guess<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Average Karters (201-300)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#209</font> (<font color=FF3333>#135</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Hurley</font> is pulling ahead of Brophy with 4 new PRs and 3 placements gained. Someone really converted that break point well…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#220</font> (<font color=FF3333>#150</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Brophy</font> didn’t play as much and lost both 1 AF and 1 placement. Don’t lose focus and catch up to that break! The Super Bowl’s over too so you have 0 excuses not to be Karting<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#247</font> (<font color=FF3333>#173</font>) <font color=yellow>Cederic</font> got plenty of improvements as always and enters top 250. Highlights are a 1:44.4 on MG and a subbing 1:22.991 on MC, gute Arbeit mein Freund<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#254</font> (<font color=FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Pabloski </font>finished his timesheet by playing flaps just in time for this News Update, after missing the last one. Our Spanish friend now enters the true competition… May your AF drop as low as possible!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#267</font> (<font color=FF3333>#184</font>) <font color=yellow>James Collins</font> subbed 59 in No-Glitch Total Time and that’s a great accomplishment. Alongside a little improvement on his Ace Track rSGB he also discovered CM Glitch and is currently grinding it, having lowered it to a very good 37.4 already. Good luck on your future sessions man<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#276</font> (<font color=FF3333>#181</font>) <font color=yellow>Xenophanes</font> only got a 1:37.7 on rDH for this update, pretty average time, not the best month you’ve had to be honest, but it’s always like this. Sometimes you get a really good month and you cut loads and sometimes motivation isn’t by your side anymore. It happens and it’s okay!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#278</font> (<font color=FF3333>#148</font>) <font color=yellow>Freddy Funny</font> got some pretty sick times like rDKM 2:09.5 or rDH 1:36.5 and recently subbed 58 in No-Glitch 3lap Total Time, great stuff coming from that part of the leaderboard<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#293</font> (<font color=FF3333>#167</font>) <font color=yellow>Supreme</font> got 5 PRs but that wasn't enough to cut AF and he lost 2 spots, very sad<br><br><font color=red><u>Karters in the Making (300+)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#303</font> (<font color=FF3333>#206</font>) <font color=yellow>Will Fury</font> got 2 PRs this month, notably a very low 1:55 on WGM. Sadly that wasn’t enough to prevent an AF gain of 2.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#318</font> (<font color=FF3333>#192</font>) <font color=yellow>Ivo Bril</font> did the glitch on MG, got a 48 (beats me by 6 seconds lmao), but also the No-Glitch with a 1:44.5, great stuff. The Dutch cuts 6 AF and climbs 7 spots with that.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#319</font> (<font color=FF3333>#185</font>) <font color=yellow>Ragemodepigeon</font> moves fast and catched up to Ivo, getting 7 PRs and cutting 11 AF in the process. Highlights include a 1:17.3 on MMM, 1:37.5 on rDH and 1:19.9 on rMC3, great performances this month!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#323</font> (<font color=FF3333>#207</font>) <font color=yellow>Peyton Gunn</font> worked on rPG to get a 2:04.8 coupled with a 39.8 Flap. Gets the job done<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#347</font> (<font color=FF3333>#198</font>) <font color=yellow>ElecTrick</font> completes his timesheet to enter the AF leaderboard this month. Happy Karting!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#372</font> (<font color=FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Greg Finke</font> also timesheets his way onto the leaderboard, may your Karting Career lead to great success!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#373</font> (<font color=FF3333>#212</font>) <font color=yellow>Ncsr. </font>improved on TF with a 1:55.5 and rDKM with a 2:13.2. Unfortunately with the amount of timesheeters this month his placement inevitably dropped by 4 and he lost 1.5 AF. However he’s very lucky because…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#377</font> (<font color=FF3333>#213</font>) <font color=yellow>Johnson Turkey</font> didn’t have a really good month either, only setting a 1:44.7 on rMR, and suffered the same way from the timesheeters. He lost 4 placements as well but 2 AF. Although Ncsr has the advantage, this is anyone’s game, and Turkey can very well break a dozen of his PRs to cut enough AF to surpass his rival. The match goes on…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#380</font> (<font color=FF3333>#226</font>) <font color=yellow>Hugh Moorhead</font> got his 1:09 on LC after missing it last month, amazing job at your level. He then went on to play some glitches and got a 51 on MG (beats me by 3 seconds) and a 22 on GV (beats me by 1.5 seconds). That’s the way you cut AF Karters and Kartesses, you play glitches and jump from like #600 on a track to #100 and move up the ranks fast. Also yes, my PBs are now a unit of skill measurement in glitches. As long as you beat me, you’re decent.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#413</font> (<font color=FF3333>#225</font>) <font color=yellow>DarthNiko</font> from the land of Unknown dropped 19 PRs to cut 33 AF, cool to see<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#444</font> (<font color=FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Emil Lönquist </font>submitted half a timesheet to complete his and get placed on the leaderboard.

Enough to cut 1 AF and 1 placement.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#605</font> (<font color=FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Robert McKinnon</font> completes his timesheet this month, welcome to the leaderboard<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#630</font> (<font color=FF3333>#284</font>) <font color=yellow>Jack Sahaida</font> improved on 26 categories but “only” cut 15 AF and 9 placements, I’ll never understand statistics like these<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#640</font> (<font color=FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Mikage</font> only submitted 2 PRs and thus got blown away, losing 5 spots and gaining 3 AF.

You’ll climb away from that bottom spot with enough faith and determination, I’m sure of it!<br><br><br>And that's every Karter that was active this month! After being very busy for the month I began to write that News quite late, this evening actually. The fact that I wrote all of that in \"just\" 5 hours is insane.

Grab yourself a drink, enjoy your meal, because we’re diving right away into this month’s headlines…<br><br><br><i><u>What happened this month exactly?</u></i><br><br>Well, Nintendo released the first wave of DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe but that’s not quite the headline<br><br>By the initiative of Bickbork, we opened this month a brand new Public Time Trial Discord server! Now that’s a headline. Meant to foster discussion surrounding Time Trials and bring together Karters from every skill level, this server proposes an entire helping section for anyone to ask for tips, tricks and feedback on any track. It also includes sections dedicated to other categories such as Custom Tracks, Karts-only, Automatic and more, and even has a channel dedicated to Time Submissions for the Player’s Page, so there’s no good reason not to join it! Here’s the invite link: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/hsckuxE8SJ\", target=\"_blank\">https://discord.gg/hsckuxE8SJ</a><br>Oh and not to mention I’m part of the staff team there too so you better join it<br><br>Also Bynt is trying to revive Fox’s old “MKW Records” Youtube channel, but he does not know what to do with it yet. I don’t think it’ll get the WR uploads because the current “CTGP Records” channel already has a large audience but this old channel may receive all the Continental/Country record stuff. Nothing is acted though, so that could change at any time. Updates on that… Well, next News Update. Hence the “Update” in the name. Finally I understand why I call this thing as such.<br><br>This News cycle went through April 1st as well, so MKLeaderboards played their game and went crazy with the top tens. So we got DKS 1:44 not by Blake, MH 1:42 by Brett with Spear Auto, WGM 1:49 by Ixy, stuff like this, all in one day. I could say that was a pretty neat day for the WR scene… Until everything went back to normal on the 2nd. And they didn’t even give me my CR on Moonview. I’ll never forgive them! I submitted a completely legit 1:43.269 how could they do this to me!<br><br>…Ahem. Anyway. How about we talk about the real WRs we got this News cycle. Yeah that's better. We got 11 WRs in March, thus sitting at a total of 36 WRs for the first 3 months of 2022. If we exclude the first 3 years of the game (2008-2010) this ranks at the 3rd best start of a year, just below 2019 (40 WRs) and 2011 (44 WRs), and that's a great sign for 2022. Let's see who improved the top times this month…<br><br>Barney improved his GV No-SC WR again following his activity in the past month. We don't talk about me saying \"I'd say he gets a .0 in June but ends the year without the sub\" as he got to a 1:51.067 literally less than a week after my News on March 11th… yeah never trust my predictions lol<br><br>I feel like he deserves the title of \"Roger Federer of MKW\". Darragh from the UK, shot his shot one last time as a bit of a farewell to the WR scene and reclaimed his long-lost Shy Guy Beach WR from Kasey on March 12th with a 1:21.457, more than 3 and a half years after his last WR, on rPG. This is the 2nd time he's had WR on this track, last and only other time being in late 2014. What a way to say goodbye to the scene…<br><br>DK's Snowboard Cross is superior to emptiness according to the Mii name Connor used to get his WR on rWS No-Glitch on March 16th. Just a simple 11ms improvement to a 1:48.422, nothing too exciting, but it does make the job harder for Ace to reclaim the top spot…<br><br>Kaede continued his grind to lower his RR No-Glitch WR even further, down to a 2:24.536 on March 25th. Man literally posts paces and fails almost everyday on his Twitter, .4 likely is coming quite soon…<br><br>The Demon King is reigning on his Ace Track Maple Treeway, as he got a 2:14.059 on March 27th, inching closer to the sub, his 3rd one since his current reign started with a 2:16.330 from November 2016. We'll see when he gets there.<br><br>Logan improved on TF Shortcut but it's not in March since he set his 1:44.308 on April 2nd, and that sadly ends his monthly WR streak. Other than that there's not really much to it because the three real big-hitters of this News cycle come right next<br><br>He makes me work overtime! Braixen posted on Twitter the fact that his CM Glitch WR of 31.481 has lasted more than 1000 days, being his 3rd WR to do so, an untied record. So what would you think he’d do with that? Leave it and pray it stands forever? That’s what everyone thought he would do because no one saw this monster of a time being taken down anytime soon… Yet here I am now talking about it in the “New WRs” section of this News Update, because, as you guessed it, he has done the unthinkable once again. Braixen thus shocked everyone when he improved his record by more than .1 with a 31.335 on April 6th, so just yesterday as I was writing this News. Asserting his dominance on the category, the WR holder since November 2016 really shows he himself holds the keys to this track’s mastery.<br><br>After a 2000+ days reign. Absolute dominance on WW tops. And establishing himself as \"the enigma\". Japanese player Zeke got dethroned for the first time on Bowser's Castle No-SC by American player Jared2K, with a 2:20.470 set on March 24th first (that wasn't driven on CTGP lmao) then to a 2:20.431 (driven on CTGP this time thankfully) a week later. \"Absolute Chad move\" as some would say, one of our longest reigns and one of Japan's only WRs left are now gone. Will the BC GOAT return once more or is the King dead, thus long live the King? History awaits, Karters.<br><br>And speaking of fucking History. It was made on March 25th. See, McRaren came back to the TT scene on Wario's Gold Mine Glitch a few years ago. He was an old Time Trialer from back in 2009 that competed mainly against Mr. Bean for the track's crown. That story in itself is incredible, but what if I told you… it happened again. After thirteen years. Spanish Player Poyo booted up the game once more to try and revive his long gone WR memories from back in the day, and he fucking succeeded, nevertheless on the SAME DATE as his last WR here, in 2009. Beating Logan's former WR by a symbolic 1 millisecond, with a 31.849. That Karters and Kartesses, is a true example of a miracle. And it concludes our 3lap WR review for this News Update.<br><br>Yes I said 3lap. Yes Flaps exist and we broke some of our Flap records this month. One especially, thanks to the discovery of a faster way of doing the 2nd shroom of rMC3. Kasey improved Luke’s former record (that almost lasted 1500 days) a total of 4 times from a 23.882 to a 23.784 in early March.<br><br>A little word on our current 3lap WR timesheet, the oldest time on there after Braixen’s improvement is Sosis’ 2:03.750 on rSL No-Glitch set on July 10th, 2019 and sitting today at 1002 days. Next time to potentially reach that number is Luke’s 1:28.425 on DC standing at 969 days, which would be his first ever 1000+ days old WR if no one beats it until the 8th of May.<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> And the award goes to… <font color=yellow>France</font>! Yes we actually exist and got some great times this News cycle. A 6th WW on BC by Istior, a WW top improvement to 8th WW on LC by Don Capri, a 6th European by Nao on WGM and me who can't get good times but still managed a French Top with a low 2:05 on rSL No-Glitch did the job in my opinion when the activity was pretty much entered around USA and other countries didn't really improve their records and tops so massively. I mean, if you look at our recent achievements for the number of active players we have you can say it's quite a good month for us…<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>TRACK OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=yellow><i>Bowser's Castle</i></font> takes the top spot once more with the 2 new WRs set by Jared late this News cycle, ending Zeke's 5 and 1/2 years reign that started in September 2016, alongside plenty of people improving their times including Istior and Rewan getting WW Tops or Emil and Logan making their way onto American Tops. As a runner-up, I'd say <font color=yellow><i>Sherbet Land</i></font> is a likely candidate as many players including me, Shane and GLuke played it aiming for a 2:04 this month, Invincible got USA Tops and Obeisant played the glitch category and got himself a pretty good time that’s on Oceanian Tops as well.<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>QUOTE(S) OF THE MONTH:</u></font><br><font color=#999999><i>\"Are you from China?

He grinded so much this month to achieve such a placement he just kept beating his times and moving up closer and closer to that <font color=#FF3333>#1</font> spot, he eventually got it and is currently a bit shy of 1 AF ahead of Justin. That man. Is on fire. Sadly he didn’t get any WRs in March so his monthly streak ends here, but still his accomplishments are unreal. We’ll see where he can get to…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#3</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#8</font>) <font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen</font> surprised everyone, as previously mentioned, with his new WR on CM Glitch. As he was already 1st here he didn’t cut any spots with that only improvement so his AF and ranking stays the same as if he didn't improve.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#4</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#7</font>) <font color=yellow>Arvo Koskikallio</font> made GAMT greater than WALPI by improving his GV No-SC Flap to a 35.706 that’s 3rd WW. That’s what we call, dear Karters, a W. But man got an even larger W this month… And it’s not on the TT side so it’s even more important than all our bullshit. Congrats on losing 30kg in less than a year my friend, feeling good about yourself is the first key to a happy and peaceful life. And that’s better than every W you can have in this game.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#7</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#21</font>) <font color=yellow>Jack Gluesing</font> played nothing other than DDR to cut some AF since it’s his worst-placed track and brought his time down to a 1:49.627 alongside a 33.499 flap. The machine’s running calmly and surely as always.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#9</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#17</font>) <font color=yellow>Vincent Nguyen</font> finished the work on GV2 No-Glitch and got his 52.8 with a 52.862 that’s 5th WW, alongside a nice 2:22.8 on BC No-SC and a 1:16.1 on MMM. He moves up one placement with that, overtaking Totom that’s now only 1 spot away from being kicked out of the Combined Top 10. Who will get the job done?<br><br><font color=red><u>Leading Karters (11-50)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#12</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#9</font>) <font color=yellow>Bynt</font> trackhopped a ton this month and got many good times including MMM 1:15.9, BC 2:21.9, MG 1:41.5 or BC3 2:17.4. He then realized he could break into the No-Glitch Top 10 this update so he played a few flaps and beat both Filler and David, take a good look everyone this is the real power of Flaps<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#13</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#15</font>) <font color=yellow>ZedR</font> almost went silent for the entire News cycle since his only PRs on both DDR categories were driven on April 3rd. He thus got a 1:48.6 3lap with a 33.2 Flap that’s cracked as always for the <font color=#33AADD>#1</font> Germany.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#17</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#14</font>) <font color=yellow>Nick Meade</font> played KC on stream for this update after apparently… Quitting his job as a dietitian? I hope what you planned on doing works for you Meade. His grind worked at least, as he got a 2:19.555. Good luck for your future, both inside and outside of Time Trials!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#20</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#18</font>) <font color=yellow>Dane Allen </font>only played BC shortcut for a 2:10.676, ranked 10th American.

I’ll try to catch up to you on that track when I’m back at it though, track is cursed but I’ll do my best<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#48</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#83</font>) <font color=yellow>Hunter Wells</font> got the big sub 2:20 on MT yesterday with a 2:19.882. Other than that he played BC Shortcut earlier in March, getting his times down to a 2:11.7 3lap and 43.1 Flap. Not enough to lower his AF sadly but his placement didn’t change in either charts, making this month a pretty neutral one.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#49</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#92</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Loerzel</font> almost didn’t get included in this update because the stats page sucks! He only improved on rSL No-Glitch, shooting big with a 2:04.695 that’s 10th USA, his first No-Glitch Top 10. Poggers in chat, is that what cool people say nowadays?<br><br><font color=red><u>Experienced Karters (51-100)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#57</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#62</font>) <font color=yellow>Shane Hogan</font> improved on a few tracks like DKS 1:50.8 or rMR 1:43.0 but his main focus in March was MT Glitch. And oh man was he on fire on that. He made the glitch, 3/3, and got a 1:42.035 that’s 6th WW. Excellent work from the Irish.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#62</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Lawrence</font> is improving at the speed of light and got many PRs, the highlight being by far a 1:09.573 on LC. He also got a WW Top on a glitch category this month however. No it’s not GV, MG, WGM, CM, DKJP or anything like that. Believe it or not… He becomes the 3rd person to land the Rainbow Road Glitch in a real run to finish with a time of 2:19.049. Sometimes you just have to follow your dreams to make them a reality.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#66</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#83</font>) <font color=yellow>Mitchell Healy</font> has been consistent with the improvements as our climbing Australian cut 14 AF for 10 spots with most notably a 1:47.9 on DKS that’s Oceanian Record by almost 2 whole seconds. Not to mention a 1:53.9 on MT Glitch that’s quite impressive too.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#67</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#37</font>) <font color=yellow>Mo No</font> played the best track in the game this month. I call Moonview, with a 1:43.709 that’s 3rd German and .150 away from CR thus European Tops. I don’t know if he plans on pushing it further but I may have to work a little bit harder to get on these tops myself next time I touch the track… Good luck if you decide to go for it though.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#69</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#46</font>) <font color=yellow>Alberto Barba</font> did the unthinkable and actually subbed 1:57 on CM using the Wii Wheel, being the first one to do so. Talk about an exploit. With Mitchell and Lawrence passing him though he lost a few spots… Only to be back at the holy <font color=#33AADD>#69</font>. As always.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#70 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#61</font>) <font color=yellow>Claus</font> got few times this month, only a 1:18.8 on rMC3, a 1:53.5 on GV and a 40.7 on CM Glitch. Nothing too special… And I wondered how he didn’t pass me on Red Charts when I almost didn’t play lol <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#74</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#72</font>) <font color=yellow>WiiLord95</font> IS ACTUALLY PLAYING THIS GAME oh no wait it’s gonna be one of those Vanilla-MKW runs set without ctgp WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL HE USED CTGP THE LORD RETUUUUURNS! …Yeah WiiLord actually was active and played on CTGP this month I believe for the first time ever. So what did he set exactly? A 1:53.511 on MT Glitch that takes the 10th American spot. What a return. Can we expect more though, I have no idea. We’ll see if Jaxon shows more interest in Time Trials during the next few News Updates… <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#77</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#122</font>) <font color=yellow>Nate Schultz </font>dedicated himself to MT Glitch this month and kinda battled with Shane and others to keep his spot on WW Tops, which he did with a 1:43.159, 8th WW. The Updating Gang stays strong!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#88</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#60</font>) <font color=yellow>ArthurOww</font> tried to lower his rPG but failed so he played BC to get a 2:23, got it but failed to improve further. I then went on to play some rSL to get myself onto French Tops, doing so this month with a 2:05.352. That’s the 8th month in a row I’ve broken into a French Top and my 10th No-Glitch top, pretty neat… Goal on Sherbey is a 2:04, will work on that later this week and next I’m probably gonna drop on something like DC or rMR.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#90</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#89</font>) <font color=yellow>Neptune</font> literally cut 19 placements to smash his way onto the Combined top 100. Highlights include LC 1:09.6, KC 2:21 and rSL Glitch 1:39, much activity from our favorite planet as always but I’m not gonna get stepped on so easily! …Well let me just have my rSL 2:04 and we’ll see about me doing glitches after that. Red charts are superior anyway<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#94</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#87</font>) <font color=yellow>Clip80</font> didn’t play much but still improved, most notably on his Ace Track, DK Mountain.

He cut 4 placements, could we aim for a Top 100 placement by the end of the year perhaps?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#145</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#89</font>) <font color=yellow>Acquiesce</font> got so many great No-Glitch times, 1:16.1 MMM, 2:21.0 KC, 2:05.3 rSL, 2:05.8 rDS, 1:18.6 rMC3 and bangers 1:13.2 rPB and 1:52.7 GV, it’s difficult not to appreciate the quality of his No-SC Timesheet. So noble and pure. As every timesheet should be… What do you mean Combined is the main chart<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#137</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#111</font>) <font color=yellow>Jadid</font> played Moonview for a 1:44.8 so it’s automatically a great month for the Italian. Because Moonview is very cool. Alongside it he worked on various flaps, most notably getting Top 100 times on rPB, rBC3 and rDKJP, all No-SC. A bit sad that his MH Flap ended up 101st, it barely wasn’t enough but it’s still quite good!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#146</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#109</font>) <font color=yellow>Darragh J</font> almost didn’t get included in the update but I remembered he had a player page and that his rSGB WR wasn’t yet on the site, and that’s to my knowledge and according to the parser the only time he got this month. Still an insane one nonetheless as I told before, a W so big that fucking Totom showed up in the comments to congratulate him.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#149</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#125</font>) <font color=yellow>Nara Hiero</font> got a sub 40 on WGM in mid-March with a 39.497, trackhopped a bit especially for a 1:53.4 on rWS, and then spent the end of the month grinding rYF to bring his time down to a great 59.709 just yesterday, smashing Canadian Tops, with potential for even more in the coming weeks. A great progress for our most active Canadian that also just entered top 150 this News cycle!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#156</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#155</font>) <font color=yellow>Rheece Wachow</font> played very early and very late in this News cycle, landing rPB Glitch literally the day the last News was posted with a 1:09.169, and subbing 1:44 on rMR just a few days ago with a 1:43.9. With those he still moved up 6 placements, gotta love glitches for all these free AF cuts<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#158</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Idriz</font> only played BC Shortcut with a 2:12.2 to figure in this News Update. Although both Nara and Rheece have passed him he still didn’t move any spots, I guess one PR a month keeps the AF gains away… That doesn’t sound right at all but with day replacing month it doesn’t work<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#162</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#129</font>) <font color=yellow>Blue B#</font> focused on different tracks like rMC for a 1:32.5 or CM Glitch for a 43.8 but his main highlight is the amazing 1:51.090 he set that’s not really a big cut in itself (his former PR was a .102) but shines from the fact that he relearned Nunchuck to get it, switching from Classic Pro. Not to mention this doesn’t use any new strats, so the potential for EU Tops is largely there once he implements them. Good luck on that!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#172</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#71</font>) <font color=yellow>Kenny M</font> apparently played for AF this News cycle as he improved on his weaker tracks, you love to see it. The BC3 Goat brought down his RR to a 2:30.2 and his rWS to a 1:53.1, great stuff as always, and btw if anyone’s wondering why he’s not higher on the rankings it’s simply because he doesn’t know what a Flap is.<br><br><font color=red><u>Average Karters (201-300)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#208</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#136</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Hurley</font> is the current leader of our Ben Trio, but lost ground on his other contenders because his only 2 PRs (2:30.8 RR and 1:53.3 DDR) weren’t enough to not gain AF. While he didn’t move any spots this month was a pretty quiet one for him. And he might have a problem next month too as…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#212</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#149</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Brophy</font> said he would be back, and back he sure was this month! Man cut 8 spots with his 8 PRs to move just 4 placements away from the holy #1 Ben ranking. Highlights include a 1:52.8 on DKS, 1:22.7 on MC, 2:01.7 on rPG and a really cool 2:08.8 on rDKM. Not to mention the βτ mascot played holy Moonview Highway and got a subbing 1:45.602, that’s a triple best split run, you love to see it. I love commenting this fight. Especially since there’s more than just 2 players…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#227</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#186</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Busche</font> is a bit less active than his Ben competitors overall but still made some progress this News cycle by submitting 6 PRs and cutting 4 placements. He made the glitch on Parkway to get a 2:00.4, sadly he didn’t sub here but he redeemed himself by doing so on WGM No-Glitch and LC, with a 1:52.8 and 1:09.8 respectively. Great times, hopefully you catch up to the others to make this even more interesting.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#230</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#179</font>) <font color=yellow>James Collins</font> surprised everyone this News cycle, especially himself, by cutting a whole 39 AF and THIRTY-SEVEN PLACEMENTS. When he believed he could not achieve a ranking higher than #250, man got an insane amount of PRs and skyrocketed through the leaderboard to smash his previously stated “maximum possible ranking”. Highlights obviously are his CM 37.4 and rSL 1:45.5 Glitches that brought him Top 60 times and big AF cuts, but it’s not to underestimate the effort put in improving many other categories. We all start with the same level in the end… And the skill difference comes from how hard one works and believes.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#238</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#119</font>) <font color=yellow>Brian Lai</font> got a bit of time to work on his timesheet and improved on BC to a 2:24.2 and on rMC3 to a 1:18.8. Great stuff considering the time you likely put in these, you’re so busy nowadays<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#239</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#169</font>) <font color=yellow>Cederic</font> continued to make his way up the charts by cutting 6 AF and 8 placements. 2 tracks are standing out, MH (what a surprise huh) and WGM No-Glitch with a 1:45.9 and 1:53.7 respectively. Not to mention a WGM Flap of 36.461 that’s 100th, pretty neat placement<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#248</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#132</font>) <font color=yellow>Pabloski</font> timesheeted on the No-SC charts, you love to see it! He finished it with a few flaps early in March then started grinding 3laps, with rDS 2:06.9, rBC 2:33.2, rBC3 Shortcut 2:04.8 and a WGM 1:51.5 beautifully standing out.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#253</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#137</font>) <font color=yellow>Alex Friedman</font> only got one PR but I kinda understand it… Quality over quantity, as the time he submitted this month was a 1:16.2 on MMM that’s top 50. He even moved up 3 placements with it apparently, how cool is that for a single PR<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#257</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#171</font>) <font color=yellow>Xenophanes</font> was very productive this month, climbing 19 placements with a 22 AF cut.

He had way too many PRs for me to mention everything but he did improve his Ace Track MC’s Flap time to a 25.404 ranked 27th and that’s really cool.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#270 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#147</font>) <font color=yellow>Freddy Funny</font> PRed on MMM and MG No-Glitch, the same day, with the same placement of 115th. Pretty neat. Times are a 1:16.707 and 1:42.940 respectively. Other than that he improved on rWS with a 1:52.5 that’s 99th and on a couple flaps as well. He cut 8 placements, keep the momentum going<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#272</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#176</font>) <font color=yellow>Parker Johnson</font> got 3 PRs and cut 1 placement with notably a 1:22.6 on MC No-Glitch. Imagine with 1 placement cut every month you’d be <font color=#33AADD>#1</font> by like 2045…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#288</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#165</font>) <font color=yellow>Supreme</font> broke 6 PRs and cut 4 placements with his best being a 1:43.2 on rMR.

Still he can’t be disappointed about his month, as he cut 18 placements for 16 AF. Highlight is a MMM Flap of 24.039 that’s his first Top 100 time and even close to being top 50, good luck on the 23 if you’re still going for it!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#304</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#207</font>) <font color=yellow>Will Fury</font> only got 1 PR, a 1:59.5 on rWS, and lost one placement, being overtaken by Ragemodepigeon.

        "content": "<p><b>Lovely day, isn't it? April has passed, the Spring's at its peak, flowers are blooming, birds are singing, summer approaches, Ramadan's over for our Muslim friends and I am once again honored to write this News Update. Take a seat my dear Karters and Kartesses, and enjoy our latest meeting. This one has some very cool stuff!<br><br>But before we begin, I want to apologize for the extended delay. I wanted to release this News very early in May, around the 2nd initially, but personal problems got me away from my PC and took all my time and attention. The next News will, hopefully, be out sooner in June. Thank you very much for your patience!<br><br>And the first News of this month doesn’t only concern Mario Kart Wii. “What is it then?” I hear you saying. It simply is the best competition in the MK Community coming back after 4 years of silence. Karters, Kartesses, may I introduce you to… <font color=red> <u>The Karter Contest!</u> </font><br>Shortly, it’s a popularity contest opened to every MK Game on the Message Board where everyone votes for their favorite Karters in various polls until a champion is crowned. For contesters to get more votes and to make it more fun, they can host campaigns to encourage more people to vote for them. Since it has already begun, I’ll only explain deeply the remaining stages of this competition. The part of the Contest that’s now over is the nomination stage, where you could nominate up to 10 players you wished to see in the tournament. I talked about it in our public Discord server. At the end of this nomination period, each nominated player has been placed in one of 3 groups based on how many votes they got:<br> - <u>The Bracket Stage</u>, the main tournament at the end of which the Champion Karter is elected. A total of 64 Karters will fight to go as far as possible. Only the 10 most nominated Karters got straight in that phase, joining the “7 Lucky Bastards” that were in the Top 8 of the previous Contest (minus the Champion that cannot participate due to having already won the title before) and were automatically placed in that stage.<br> - <u>The Group Stage</u>, currently taking place, determines which Karters will have a spot in the Bracket stage. It is composed this year of 79 players, 2 of which still need to get in. As the name implies, the nominees are split in 15 groups of 5 (and one group of 4 since we’re not 80), of which only 3 (2 in the group of 4) will be able to advance to the Bracket stage. The concept is pretty straight forward, but you might wonder where the 2 Karters I talked about come from. That’s where the 3rd group comes into play.<br> - <u>The play-ins</u>, are composed of Karters that got very few votes and couldn’t directly enter the group stage. They’re meant to fill the 2 remaining Group Stage spots. A sort of “last-chance phase” to put it simply… That stage just ended a few hours ago.<br>The biggest Karting competition of the year is thus making its great return… And we’re invited! You might recognize in the Contest some names that you’re used to seeing in our leaderboards, such as Cole Gilbert or Nick Meade, and almost the whole Updating Squad is here to represent us as well. Hydr8ion, Claus, Mango Man and myself are in the group stage and Arvo is one of the 10 nominees to have secured a spot in the Bracket Stage. If you want to support our Karters, the Forum has reserved a special section for everything related to the Contest right <a href=\"https://www.mariokart64.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?board=kc2k22\">here.</a><br>Not to mention a dedicated Discord server has also been created to allow easier discussions about the Contest, alongside off-side events to entertain between matches: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/TxaPgdbWf3\">https://discord.gg/TxaPgdbWf3</a><br>Now y’all Karters and Kartesses know what to do. To the polls, make your voice heard! And good luck to every Karter that’s participating, from each game. After all, this is more of a celebration of the whole franchise than a competition between games, isn’t it?<br><br><u><i>Back to our game’s talks… What did we see this month?</u></i><br><br>First off, Finnish player Karhuma, mostly known for his involvement in Online TTs, his Twitch streams and his attachment to TF, got exposed as a cheater! Yes that still exists in 2022! We discovered that in the middle of the month, Karhuma got mad and explained clearly that he didn't care about being exposed. To him, he did nothing wrong, did it for himself, and he's #1 Finnish Time Trialer and that's all that matters. Arvo thus made 2 masterpieces of vids about the man that you must go watch if you didn't already… or even if you did because everything Arvo makes is gold. As we all know.<br><br>That's pretty much it for this month's non-WR News, honestly not much happened lately… The big News comes with our Top-Level improvements, coming right next! 10 different Karters set 14 World Records (13 3lap and 1 Flap) on 6 unique tracks this News cycle, but who, where and how exactly?<br><br>Starting off gently. Luke went to the Big Bad Castle, or rBC, and improved his PB by a little 32ms on April 8th with a 2:30.605. Not that much to add to it, but what may be a bit more interesting is that he failed a 50.2/50.0 pace to the spiral a while later, that would've been enough with how good the lap 3 was going for a 2:30.3. A best known pace of course, that could've almost ended the category…<br><br>A bit later on April 17th and after his crazy Glitch improvement, Braixen came to the No-Glitch category of Coconut Mall and improved his WR for the first time since June of 2020, ending at a 1:55.541. The fun part is that he cut the same amount of time as Luke since he beat his former PR by 32ms... Someone bring me Lowercase because this is the type of stat he loves lol<br><br>Dedication and Determination lead to Domination. That’s the quote that best describes to me the journey Alperen has been on on Mushroom Gorge. From his entry on WW Tops to his 2nd WW placement, the stars seemed to align, as everything led to one point: clearing the final step. And on March 15th, after being ahead of Connor by more than .1 after lap 1, he held it together to keep the pace up two more laps. Finishing lap 3 with a 1:40.722, beating the WR by 19ms, he had done it. He becomes the 427th Karter to get a WR in this game, and gives his country of Austria its second ever WR since… Ghost’s 2:08.402 on rSL set on April 27th 2008 that lasted a day. I think Alperen’s one is a tiny bit more spectacular.<br><br>Speaking of new players setting their first WR, Alperen wasn’t the only one to do so this month… From the tallest heights of MG’s mountains, we dive deep into the frozen cold of Sherbet Land’s cave and, more especially, hit the pole to fly across the lake and land behind the finish line. That’s what Australian player Mitch did twice in a row to claim his first ever WR on the track after a long and painful grind, beating the last remaining French WR by our national Glitch-Master Arthur and finishing the run on a 1:16.094. He did not stop there though, and decided to challenge this category’s randomness by going for another 2/3 glitch run… And smashed his PR by almost .9 with a 1:15.204 on April 11th. When this was set everyone regarded Mitch as the new King of the category… Until, 6 days later, the King fell off his throne, beaten by Core setting a 1:14.843 that's his second time ever at the top of the world. The WR had improved by over 2 seconds in just 9 days when Arthur's record lasted more than 600 days and is thus the longest lasting Glitch WR on the track.<br><br>Then the revolution knocked the door once again.<br><br>It all began around April 22nd, when a lovely man was quietly working on TASing a certain track, then found something very, very interesting. This lovely man, also being very wise, decided not to spread his discovery, but rather select only a few people to know his \"secret technique\". He then challenged his trusty Karters to perform this technique, with the reward for it being a holy World Record. One faithful Karter, filled with determination and hope, gave it all in this race to greatness… And against all odds, after a 10-hour session, he won the prize. The wise and lovely man is Justin, the track is Shy Guy Beach, the technique is a new Ultra Shortcut and the Karter… is Arvo Koskikallio.<br><br>The ultra, similar to the already known bomb clip, consists in clipping something to fall in the water next to the end of the track, getting respawned a bit ahead of the last key checkpoint thus backing up a little, then driving forwards to finish the lap. Except we don’t use the bomb anymore, but literally water itself as we clip what can be considered as the edge of the track: the limit between offroad water and out of bounds water. Basically you’re a swimmer starting their race. The thing is, clipping edges isn’t possible with “usual” vehicles such as Flame Runner, Magi or Spear… And that’s when it gets interesting. To be able to clip that thing, you are forced to use an outside drifting bike. The Zip-Zip with Daisy was thus used to perform this ultra, Arvo was the first one to do so and finished his attempt with a 1:19.831, our updating legend’s first ever WR. The PP Staff (basically me) managed to interview our newest figure in the WR books, and here’s what he had to say:<br><br><i>“It's been a blast. Me getting a WR has been a huge meme that never became true until now, having choked my one true chance on rSL glitch to nerves and getting fucked by the new strat on rWS (probably wouldn't have gotten that one but whatever). It feels like I've filled a hole that has existed within myself for the past 5 years and I truly feel that no matter what I do in this game from now on, I will forever be happy with what I did, the people I met and the good times I had. News update coming when I go on holiday lol”</i><br><br>My deepest and kindest congratulations Arvo. Out of everyone and by a longshot, it’s you that deserved to get your first WR the most. I’m glad to see someone like you finally achieving that holy milestone... Thank you for being who you are!<br><br>Following that historic achievement, the rest of the community had been made aware of the existence of the Glitch. Thus, many Karters got their hands on it, and started doing runs, so much that the WW Top was full of glitch times only 2 weeks after its reveal to the public. The WR was broken on 6 occasions, first by Logan then twice each by Justin and Kasey before Luke snatched it to claim his first ever Glitch WR, changing the meta and doing it lap 3, with one shroom instead of lap 1, with 3 shrooms, saving one shroom for each No-Glitch lap to make the same shortcut as Magikruiser does normally. While Kasey had a 1:17.552, Luke finished his first successful 1-1-1 attempt with a time of 1:15.611, a cut that nobody saw coming. And that’s where it stands at the end of this month’s News Cycle. <font size=1>I’m totally not foreshadowing next month’s News Update idk what you’re talking about</font><br><br>As said prior, we only got one Flap WR this month but that’s a sweet one. The track is rMC, the player… I think you know who it is. Absolutely smashing the counter, from Logan’s 28.542 to a 28.451, Bickbork reclaims his Ace Track’s Flap Record on April 25th after leaving it in Logan’s hands for 226 days. The cup has been brought back home.<br><br>And that concludes our WR review for this News Update! Another month is in the books, and we’re entering May with a whole 51 WRs already set in 2022. This year’s off to a rocket start…<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> I have to give it to <font color=yellow>Finland</font>. Arvo got a WR. He was #1 in the world on a track for a day and that’s all that matters. Not to mention, Karhuma also is the #1 Finnish player and that’s all that matters, so this month was pretty stacked for our nordic friends.<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>TRACK OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=yellow>Sherbet Land</font> was about to be crowned with the 3 recent Glitch WRs by Mitch and Core and many players improving in No-Glitch including Weexy, Carter, me getting Flap WW tops and Felix getting both Flap and 3lap WW tops… but with the new Ultra discovered, <font color=yellow>Shy Guy Beach</font> steals the title for sure. A bit less than 6 seconds cut with 7 new WRs is unmatchable…<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font><font color=#999999> <i>\"Are you a factory from China?

Synchronized movement from our Top 2 Karters this month.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#3</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#8</font>) <font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen</font> only got his CM WR, nothing to add to that and since this News is already delayed way too much I’ll have to rush it a little bit, sorry Braixen<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#4</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#7</font>) <font color=yellow>Arvo Koskikallio</font> is a god. He got a WR. Can you imagine that the man climbed up to #4 without ever getting one though?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#5</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#5</font>) <font color=yellow>Martin Fox</font> tried TF… But not the one he’s used to! Man played the shortcut category to get a 1:48.5 / 33.9 and cut some AF to defend his spot.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#7</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#21</font>) <font color=yellow>Jack Gluesing</font>, surprisingly enough, didn’t lose his WR on SGB Flap despite the recent discovery. I guess you still have to wait for 3 minutes to achieve greatness on that category. Our multi-flap WR holder improved on 2 3laps this month, first on rBC with a 2:31.8 then on CM for a 1:56.8. <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#9</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#17</font>) <font color=yellow>Vincent Nguyen</font> went to MMM and barely missed a 1:15, ending with a 1:16.045. He still consoled himself with a 23.970 on the flap, this time getting the sub.<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Leading Karters (11-50)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#12</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#15</font>) <font color=yellow>Zed R</font> wasn’t okay with Bynt passing him, so he trackhopped a bit to get WW Tops on 3 seperate flaps, DKS, DDR and DKM. Apparently a D-month for him. To also play a bit of 3lap, he decided to land on KC and got his time down to a 2:19… .666 oh spooky number has the German signed a pact with the devil!?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#13</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#9</font>) <font color=yellow>Bynt</font> took a break from Discord this month due to stressing about exams, that's the most adult move I've seen in a while and it's good! Concentration is key, sometimes you just have to drop something for a few days to be more prepared for a bigger thing. You'll pass these exams, I'm sure of it! Bynt still played the game though, grinding BC3 for a 2:17.1 No-SC and 1:59.0 Combined, 1:29.2 on DC and currently on MC for a 1:20 as he climbed to 4th WW here this month.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#22</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#4</font>)<font color=yellow> Starvos Ferentinos</font> followed Vincent and headed to MMM, getting his time down to a 1:16.0 as well. He loses this little battle though, as he only got a .053! The Greek only was 8 milliseconds and a single placement off the American.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#23</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#22</font>) <font color=yellow>Indy Kambeitz</font> followed the masses to play both rSL categories. He first got a 1:40.2 using the glitch, then went to No-Glitch and ended his grind with a 2:04.801. On both sides of the track, Weexy took over the 2nd Benelux spot, and on both sides he stole it from Thomas, pretty fun to see. After getting a subbing 39.996 on the No-Glitch Flap, he went to play rBC for a 2:32.1 then DC for a 1:29.9 early in May.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#24</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#3</font>) <font color=yellow>Luke Brown</font> actually played something else than his WR tracks this month! Other than the audacity he had to try his hands on the new glitch and actually getting the WR, record-breaker improved on DKS to a 1:47.6 that’s 7th EU, got this track’s Flap WW Tops and brought his RR Flap to a 48.129. That’s the type of month I like to see Luke, such diversity in the tracks you worked on! Hopefully you now understand that a track doesn’t only exist for you to get WR on it…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#26</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#34</font>) <font color=yellow>Joe S.</font> went silent for the whole month almost, as his newest PR dates back to April 9th. It’s a 1:22.8 on rSGB, modest time but gets the job done to get both a good Legend standard and a top 100!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#32</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Carter Clem</font> quickly improved his rYF hitting a 59.6 then took the Glitch Avenue and broke Sherbet Land for a 1:50 as well as (surprise!) Shy Guy Beach for a 1:19, becoming part of the first Karters to land the glitch in a run. And that’s not all, as he also beat his PR on MT Glitch Flap… This time without loafing around. A stunning 23.993 takes him to the 2nd Worldwide placement!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#35</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#41</font>) <font color=yellow>Phyzothy</font> has been begging for a News Update even though I said multiple times I had to delay it, how are you so patient on glitch attempts but can’t wait 2 weeks for a few words written besides your name smh! He made a big jump this month, 6 placements with 7 PRs from which include CM 35.0, BC 2:12.0, rSGB No-Glitch 1:22.7 and rYF 59.4. I wonder how high you’ll be at next News Update…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#38</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#87</font>) <font color=yellow>Hydr8ion</font> did the bare minimum to be mentioned in this Update, only setting 2 Flap PRs. But as we know, Flaps are the best categories, so I won’t blame it for that. I’ll rather incite y’all Karters and Kartesses to congratulate him, as one his two improvements is on his Ace Track GV Glitch where he managed to find timesave from I-don’t-know-where-because-this-category-his-way-too-short and brought his time down to a 3.215, 4th WW. Great stuff mate, and little update on the Contest you didn’t even care to be in, you just finished last of your group and got eliminated lmao<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#43</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#40</font>) <font color=yellow>Dude Dude</font> isn’t frozen anymore, so that means he’s not #1 anymore and that’s not what matters. Chaos thus thawed out on April 6th when he probably submitted all the PRs he hadn’t put onto the site at once because you have like 10 from that same date, highlight being by far the holy sub on rWS with a 1:49.944.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#48</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#84</font>) <font color=yellow>Hunter Wells</font> tested his clipping skills, after his legendary rWS run, on TF this month to get a 1:48.4, then the mandatory SGB Glitch run of 1:19.3 that currently ranks 9th WW. As for the only other time he set this News Cycle, it’s a 1:50.9 on DDR to cut some AF and stay at a negative change for this month.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#49</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#92</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Loerzel</font> pleased me. He played flaps. No-Glitch flaps even. Already an epic month in my eyes. Notable times are a 46.7 BC that’s Legend D, a chad 40.420 rSL No-Glitch and a stunning 11.7 rSL Glitch, followed a month later by a 3lap improvement to a 1:36.9 that’s most impressive considering he only makes the glitch once.<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Experienced Karters (51-100)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#54</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Lawrence</font> kept on the pace this month as the No-SC denier climbed up 8 spots with 7 PRs, most notably making the new SGB Glitch, with a 4th place on our charts cutting 232 placements from his No-SC PR with it. I cannot deny that he played TF without the box clip for the first time this month, setting a 1:50.8, but I’m sure it was just to clean up his driving for his Glitch runs…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#56 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#63</font>) <font color=yellow>Shane Hogan</font> has been very solid on the glitch categories as well, hitting 2 WW Top times throughout the month: CM as his current best ranked time, being Braixen’s runner-up with a 32.092, and MG as his 4th WW Top track, being 8th WW with a 28.055. As a sort of break from Glitches, he also played DC and got a 1:30.0 alongside a 28.5 Flap. He moves up one placement.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#57</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#67</font>) <font color=yellow>Mitchell Healy</font> has moved up a little bit more. Just a tiny bit… 9 placements. 16 in No-SC. I mean when you submit 13 PRs in a month you have to move up fast. Other than his WR on rSL Glitch, highlights are a 1:16.9 MMM, 1:29.9 DC (with a 29.000 flap!), 53.4 rGV2, 2:08.4 rDKM, 2:05.3 rSL No-SC, and above all a 1:32.916 on the Shortcut category of rDH, barely missing out on WW Tops by 72ms. Hydr8ion’s spot at the top still lives!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#67 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#45</font>) <font color=yellow>Alberto Barba</font> only submitted a 2:29.9 on RR. Maybe he wanted to stay at his private <font color=#33AADD>#69</font> spot? Well, he failed in doing so since, even though he didn’t cut AF this month, he gained less than his nearest competitors, overtaking them because of that. You’ll have to conquer your Kingdom once again!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#73 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#62</font>) <font color=yellow>Michele Gallastri </font>got submitted a lot of his PRs, because apparently other Italians care more about having his full timesheet on the site than himself. Interesting. Since we now have his entire timesheet, that was missing on 21 of his records, Cross moves up 20 placements. The most notable time of them all is of course his recent CM breakthrough, where his time came down to a 32.760, 8th WW.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#76</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#48</font>) <font color=yellow>Watcha</font> got a good bunch of stacked PRs this month! 1:16.2 MMM, 1:41.7 MG, 59.3 rYF, 1:22.2 rSGB, 1:52.1 rWS and 2:00.6 rPG are all in his Record Recap for this month, making him dive deep into top 80. Great stuff from the German as always.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#86 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>JAYOO</font> is the first Karter to be welcomed since he timesheets his way onto… Top 100 already!? I swear glitches give so much AF it’s absurd. Now finish your No-SC timesheet for everyone to see your driving skills!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#87 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#37</font>) <font color=yellow>Kasper </font>focused on a few 3laps, being rMR with a 1:42.0, CM with a 1:56.5 and BC3 with a 2:18.2, to bounce back after his usual break from TTing and maintain his placement, especially in No-Glitch.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#88 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#82</font>) <font color=yellow>Neptune</font> passed me and came right into my DMs to laugh to my face! What a disrespectful, childish attitude! …Oh but he’s a kitten oh he’s so cute! Oh everything’s forgiven. Ehem! Anyway. Jokes aside, the Litten enjoyer mainly played glitch categories and that’s how he passed me. Improving his rSL to a 1:39.0 and also hitting SGB with a 1:19.7 and 18.3 flap. He knew that I wouldn’t let that be, that I would fight, so he got his claws out and went to No-SC to improve on SGB with a 1:22.9, CM with a 1:58.5, MG with a 1:42.3 and GV2 with a 53.4. Nice stuff, but be prepared for revenge! My French Finals revisions will have to wait!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#90</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#58</font>) <font color=yellow>ArthurOww</font> was planning on having one of his most productive TTing months of the year, but life had chosen another path! I got the job done on rSL No-Glitch, getting a 2:04.880 that’s currently 4th French alongside a 39.951 Flap that’s way more than 4th French as it’s 2nd French, 5th European and… 10th Worldwide, my 2nd Flap WW Top after Parkway (that I don’t even have anymore because… Logan). I’m currently playing DC, already got down to a 1:29.882 that’s 3rd French but I know I can cut off a lot more if I learn a few more things.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#91</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Ethan Hedley</font>, as Mitchell Healy, didn’t play rSL Glitch exclusively but went on a few more tracks. More modest, Core improved his weakest times such as GV or rBC, and improved an already better MC to a 1:22.5.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#94</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#86</font>) <font color=yellow>Clip80</font> went on vacation this month to step on the golden sands of Desert Hills, where he improved both his Glitch time to a 1:35.4 and his No-Glitch time to a 1:35.9 paired with a pretty 29.8 Flap. Enough to keep his spot safe.<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Noticeable Karters (101-200)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#124</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#77</font>) <font color=yellow>2ndmatt</font> only got his Flap WR this month. Parser says he got 20 other times but when I check his profile the newest time is from November lmfao<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#128</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#65</font>) <font color=yellow>Acquiesce</font> continues to climb the ranks as his timesheet slowly gets filled with top 100 times… On Red Charts of course. Highlights of this month to me are a 1:18.4 on MC3 and a low 1:09.5 on LC (just barely missing me I win!), two prestigious times to add to an already prestigious timesheet.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#134</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#104</font>) <font color=yellow>Jadid</font> went to Moonview this month for a 1:44.7. Really cool choice. Yes I’m gonna say that every time someone plays Moonview, don’t ask why because the answer is clear in everyone’s minds and that’s because it’s the best track in the game and my propaganda is the worst in the world. Other than that and a bunch of standard flaps, the focus point of Jadid’s month here was rMC, where he brought his time down to a 1:32.8 and 29.2 for the Flap. Enough to cut a good 3 placements.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#138</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Idriz</font> I swear you weren’t even in top 150 last News Update and you just cut 20 spots without any pressure whatsoever? Clean. Even more clean when you know that he got back his RR Wheel WR with a time of 2:25.578 only .3 off WW Tops. Very productive month thus for the wheeler that cleaned up his timesheet alongside that, with notable times being a subbing 53.995 on rGV2, a good 1:00.1 on rYF and a lovely 1:45.7 on MH.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#144</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#119</font>) <font color=yellow>Nara Hiero</font> finished the job on the first day of the News Cycle, setting a 59.7 on rYF. Everyone's favorite Canadian then passed the rest of the month between KC and SGB most notably, getting to a 2:22.7 and a 1:23.5 respectively... At least in No-Glitch. There's still one more track we haven't talked about. The real grind that Nara was on this News Cycle was on CM, where, starting from nothing, he climbed up the ranks, quickly getting into Canadian Tops. The thing is, he knew he had potential. So he did not stop there. And I'm sure he's glad he didn't. Canadian Tops? A formality. In just a few days our favorite LC enjoyer, far from his Home Track, climbed up to the Top of his Tops. His first ever Country Record in the bag, he looked up in the sky and asked himself: \"Is this run my perfection?\" and the answer was clear. \"No.\" it wasn't. And so he TTed. And so he improved. Karters and Kartesses, after spending the whole month on the track, on the last day of this News Cycle, May 3rd, Canadian player Nara Hiero, known for his past efforts on Luigi Circuit (and maybe also for his amazing pfp), set a CM Glitch time of 33.142. That is 9th American. His first ever Continental Tops. My deepest congratulations on such an amazing achievement Nara, I'm glad to see you get these types of runs especially after the grind you went through!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#152 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#153</font>) <font color=yellow>Rheece Wachow</font> got 6 PRs to cut 5 AF and 4 spots, those PRs being DC 1:31.4, rMR 1:43.9, rSGB 1:23.6 and 1:19.3 MC3 most notably, with his best coming from his DKM Glitch run of 2:08.989. Good stuff and good subs, top 150 arrives soon hopefully<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#162</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#129</font>) <font color=yellow>Aaron M</font> moved up almost the same way, the numbers only were mixed up a little. For 5 PRs he lost 3 AF and cut 4 placements. Highlights of his new records to me have to be his 2:22.7 on BC that’s his best-ranked 3lap time and his 39.4 on CM that’s his first and only 3lap Glitch Top 100 time.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#172</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>StarBoi</font> only played MG this month for a really cool 32.403, 2nd Oceanic just over .1 behind Jyran holding the record. Keep it up, I know you can beat him! He’s a child after all he got no experience whatsoever!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#173</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#74</font>) <font color=yellow>Kenny M</font> got a single time of 1:52.6 on rWS this month. That’s everything.<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Average Karters (201-300)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#205</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#136</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Hurley</font> takes full advantage of the absence of his rival Ben Brophy to cut 4 AF with 6 PRs and prove to the Karting world that there's no rivalry between the two and that he's just the better Ben in every way. We'll see about that! In the meantime, Hurley principally worked on DDR this month, lowering his time to a great 1:52.2 coupled to a 34.4 Flap. Other tracks he touched are rPG for a clutch 2:01.9 and BC for both a 2:23.0 Glitch and a 2:24.6 Glitchless. Top 200 will soon be in the bag I'm sure of it<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#206</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#155</font>) <font color=yellow>Jeroen Schepers</font> played for the first time since I took over for News Updates, meaning that I have now written at least once for every Updater. I catched 'em all! Jeroen played TF and CM No-Glitch this month, getting a 1:52.7 and a 2:00.2 respectively how can you not have subbed 2 minutes already when you set a 38.5 on the Flap go get that sub!!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#215</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#167</font>) <font color=yellow>James Collins</font> I recall \"didn't see himself reaching Top 250 ever in a million years\" just a few months ago. I could almost bet he's hitting Top 200 next News Update. This is Karting man, everything's possible! I tell you, you could even breakthrough and be in Top 100 at the end of the year. With a 17 AF cut brought by 14 PRs, he moved up 15 spots. Trackhopping surely is your thing. A notable time to me is his MG Flap of 10.031, that's his 2nd best ranked time at 43rd just under rSL Flap. On the No-Glitch side his efforts on Moonview were also very pleasing to see… And I'll tell you the same thing Arvo told me back in August: The 1:44 will happen as soon as lap 3 goes right once.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#218</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#188</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Busche</font> makes great moves to catch up on the other Bens, climbing 9 spots with 7 PRs and 11 AF cut, now only being 5 spots behind Brophy. Man I love this rivalry! Highlights are a 1:51.9 on TF and a 40.9 on CM with a 4.365 Flap that's 21st, a new best ranked time congrats!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#220</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Sam Fairless</font> played for the first time in years (newest time I could find outside of this Update was a single MT Flap from… May 2020, the rest is all 2017-2014), to get a 1:18.8 on MMM 3lap that's ranked 666th! Someone bring an exorcist! Or maybe he doesn't need one, he seems to have purged himself by grinding SGB Glitch to get himself a 1:20.2 that's 3rd UK. Now finish your No-SC timesheet to repent!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#227</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#121</font>) <font color=yellow>Pabloski</font> extended his No-Glitch mastery this month by setting 9 PRs such as 1:16.8 MMM, 2:06.9 rSL and 2:19.9 MT, climbing over 21 Karters this News Cycle. His only glitch time this Update is a 54.3 on CM, that's not even Top 300 but still beats me by 1.7 seconds, so it's at least decent for a Red Chart enthusiast! <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#228 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#150</font>) <font color=yellow>Xenophanes</font> also made a big jump, cutting exactly 29 spots with a 29 AF drop. Among his 23 PRs we find most notably a 2:06.7 rDS, 1:32.8 rMC and 2:09.4 rDKM, great job on these they're great times to add to your timesheet!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#235 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#168</font>) <font color=yellow>Cederic</font> improved on 7 categories this month, to cut 4 spots and 4 AF. Notables are to me a 1:23.6 on rSGB and 1:22.7 on MC, with an additional 49.997 on rBC Flap, clutching the sub! He played way more tracks than the ones he improved on though, such as Moonview on which he's starting to get really good laps… We'll see if he manages to get 3 good laps together.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#238</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#118</font>) <font color=yellow>Brian Lai </font>only played MC3 at the beginning of this month, hitting a 1:17.714 with a 24.202 Flap that barely gave him the Top 100. Although he didn't move any spots, he sadly gained 2 AF… There will be better months for you in the future though, I'm sure of it<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#252</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#138</font>) <font color=yellow>Alex Friedman</font> got 4 PRs, gained 1 AF but apparently moved up one placement so I guess that's good keep it up! Especially with the times you're setting, 1:52.8 rWS, 1:58.3 CM… As always the Flaps are holding you back. You know, I don't want to force you to play them (ok maybe I do but it's just a little) but if you did you'd cut way more placements than that…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#258 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#152</font>) <font color=yellow>Spencer Sassak</font> got some pretty neat times this month, such as 2:21.7 KC and 2:29.9 RR, however I cannot but notice that your DKM Flap is from… JULY 27th, 2022. DM me so I can see your time travelling machine please<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#260</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#178</font>) <font color=yellow>Elias</font> only played LC this month and got that close to a 1:09, with a 1:10.014. Unfortunate, but keep on the grind! Just tell yourself you've never been so close to the sub and that the improvement to get now is so minimal you'll get it in no time.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#279</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#185</font>) <font color=yellow>Aimee Scaricordi</font> finishes her timesheet and is now the first Karter from Malta to ever appear in a News Update. Historic moment. Good luck on the charts!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#288</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#169</font>) <font color=yellow>Supreme</font> went pretty quiet as well, he also played LC just like Elias however he barely managed to hit the sub with a 1:09.989. Along with that, he went to BC3 Shortcut to finish a 2:03.2, but that wasn't enough to not make him gain 2 AF.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#290</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#196</font>) <font color=yellow>ElecTrick</font> literally jumped and slammed the door to Top 300, setting 19 PRs this News Cycle and passing 21 people. Out of all of them and with no surprise, the highlight to me is his MG Glitch, that he grinded with much dedication throughout the month and ended with a 42.3 and 10.3 Flap, both being his best-ranked times at 61st and 62nd respectively. Great job, may you carry that momentum into next month!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#292 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#180</font>) <font color=yellow>Ragemodepigeon</font> didn't move as much but still entered top 300 strong with 7 PRs and an AF cut of 12! Now you're officially, just like ElecTrick, a true established Karter. Notable times from him this month are 1:22.9 on MC and a very rewarding 1:51.8 on TF achieved after a pretty long grind and several fails. Perseverance is key everyone!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#294 </font>(<font color=#FF3333>#189</font>) <font color=yellow>Luc S</font> finishes his timesheet as he registers and barely places in Top 300. Welcome to the AF grind! <br><br><br><font color=red><u>Karters in the Making (300+)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#305</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#213</font>) <font color=yellow>Will Fury</font> set enough PRs to cut AF this month, highlight being a great 1:32.8 on rMC, but sadly not enough to move up the ranks. He thus stays at the edge of Top 300 without succeeding in making the final step… But <i>Will</i> he ever be able to? <font size=1>Honestly I hope so it was only to make the dumbest joke you’ve probably heard a million times sorry</font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#317</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#197</font>) <font color=yellow>Ivo Bril</font> almost went missing this News Update, not because he hadn’t submitted times (he did, and multiple times even) but because the parser is a bitch and forgot him. Thankfully I have a good memory. The Dutchman played TF and rDS this News Cycle, one for a 1:53.2 / 35.9 Flap and the other for a 2:07.9.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#319</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#211</font>) <font color=yellow>Graden</font> or Glitch G or Narumi or lowercaselettersV2 or I-don’t-even-know-anymore timesheeted this month, welcome to the leaderboard<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#356</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Greg Finke</font> gets the job done with little effort, as he cuts 2 placements while only setting 3 PRs. If there was a Time Management leaderboard, you’d surely be in Top 100 already…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#369</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#217</font>) <font color=yellow>Ncsr.</font> fights alone as his rival has now been silent for 2 News Cycles. Match seems to be at half time… And our active Karter took this opportunity to slow things down a little, only PRing to keep his spot on the leaderboard. 6 little PRs, with an AF gain of 3.9, no placements lost in Combined but a whole 7 in No-SC, thankfully for him Turkey went down the same way. We’ll see how this will go in the coming months…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#405</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#203</font>) <font color=yellow>Ryan Lynch</font> literally swapped the 0 and the 5 in his ranking as he was #450 last News Update, doing so by breaking a whole 45 PRs FROM HIS TIMESHEET what the hell is this that’s so cool. He also timesheets in No-Glitch which is very pleasing to see, welcome to the Chad’s leaderboard!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#412</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#215</font>) <font color=yellow>Zevohno</font> timesheets in the same News Cycle as he registers, you always love to see it. Good luck on the charts!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#422</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Emil Lönquist</font> was pretty silent this month with only 3 PRs, but still managed the impossible feat to move up 8 whole placements while only cutting 1 single AF. That’s magic before your eyes right there.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#471</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#252</font>) <font color=yellow>Charlotte Crego</font> participates in the Karter Contest this year, go vote for her she deserves it! And since she's probably been busy preparing her campaign she didn't have the time to play MKW, only setting 3 PRs this month and dropping 2 placements. Unfortunate, but I hope you'll do well in the competition!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#472</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Desmond-Hooper</font> gained 1 AF with 7 PRs… And still moved up 5 placements Math is really cool<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#562</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#267</font>) <font color=yellow>Kate Petit</font> seemed to have enjoyed the game her cousin presented her as she timesheets in both charts, and I’m pleased to welcome Malta representatives in our leaderboard!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#568</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#268</font>) <font color=yellow>Chansey</font> used Seismic Toss on the charts to pass through and smash the Top 600, cutting 35 placements with as many PRs and 52 AF.

That’s the question we ask for the next Update…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#630</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#287</font>) <font color=yellow>Luke Norman</font> decided to pick the game up again after setting his last PRs in July, welcome back! the 4 PRs you submitted weren’t enough to grant you an AF loss sadly, making you drop 2 placements. I’ll confess, it’s mostly because of all the people registering that add a spot on the list when they finish their timesheet…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#635</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#294</font>) <font color=yellow>Jack Shaida</font>, despite submitting 8 PRs, gained 7.5 AF. If setting records makes you gain AF, I wonder if you couldn’t try canceling them to see if it has the opposite effect…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#728</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#363</font>) <font color=yellow>Nicolai Scaricordi</font> is our last Karter of this month’s Update and a timesheeter as well, guided by the good advice of his sister Aimee. You might be low on the list but hey, we all start somewhere don’t we? Also with how much time and effort you put into that timesheet it’s not the worst placement in the world trust me. Nevertheless, if you ever want to touch this game again, please know that we’ll always welcome you with open arms. May our roads cross once again dear Karter!<br><br><br>And that, Karters and Kartesses, is how the leaderboard currently looks like!

As we’ve wrapped up this month of May, as Real Madrid won their 14th Champions League against Liverpool (Luke’s so, so mad) and Rafael Nadal his 14th French Tennis Open against Casper Ruud… It’s that time of the month again, time of the News Update! A little earlier than last month thankfully!<br><br>And as in last month’s News Update, here’s an introductive reminder that the Karter Contest 2k22 is still taking place in our Forums! You want to elect the future KC Champion? Well, we stand currently at the Final Bracket phase, more precisely in the (Thrilling) Round of 32. This is a very important phase, as the matches are starting to get more and more tense and close! We’ve already had 3 matches that came down to just ONE VOTE in not even 2 rounds, that’s just insane… If you’re ready to watch a page of our History unfold, go and make your vote COUNT my dear Karters! Here’s the link to the Message Board section <a href=\"https://www.mariokart64.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?board=kc2k22\">here.</a><br><br>I promise it’s the last time you hear about it and it’s gonna be over before the next News Update anyway so see you in 2k24 to see the words “Karter Contest” written together again in an MKW News Update I guess :P<br><br>Also as a more global News, the NFT market is dying! That means all the weird monkeys you see everywhere will now start to disappear, probably as fast as they arrived at the top. Either you love’em or hate’em, you have to admit that people really paid insane amounts of money to own these special PNG images… Was it worth it? Probably not. But hey, I didn’t buy any nor did I sell any so I don’t have to worry about it!<br><br><u><i>And more locally, what happened for our game this month exactly?</i></u><br><br>Remember the new Public Discord server I talked about one or two News Updates ago? Well, regarding himself as not active enough for his title, server creator Bickbork decided to renounce to his Server Owner status to find a new, more involved Karter to handle the server’s administration… And that Karter just so happened to be your dear Newswriter! I am thus now in charge of our server’s direction and already did quite the work: new emotes, a little design overhaul and an Out of Context Twitter account that I totally didn’t steal the idea from MKL. Go follow it btw: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MKWTT_OoC\">https://twitter.com/MKWTT_OoC</a><br><br>But the last thing I’ve done so far is so huge it requires a whole other paragraph to talk about it. See, I’ve had a wish for the longest time that we could create something new in our favorite game mode we’ve been playing the same way for more than 14 years. Online TTs was a very good attempt at that, but sadly has been pretty quiet for the past months. I wanted a new form of competing in Time Trials. Other than just getting PBs, cutting AF, climbing the ranks and getting into some leaderboards… Then it hit me. An idea that I’ll manage to give form and present to you all Karters in this new Discord server. May I call… The <u><i>TIME TRIALING MASTERS TOUR!</i></u> Here’s the introduction of it I posted in the server:<br><br><i>“A brand new and original TT Competition, imagined, created, and brought to you by yours truly. The concept is fairly simple: during each month, we'll host one Event on a specific Track. If you're participating, you'll earn Tour Points based on your performance. This Tour will be cut in Seasons of 8 Events, and at the end of each Season, the Karters with the most points will face off in the Masters' Trial. Whoever wins this final showdown is crowned as the Season's TT Master! However... Events are not gonna be boring TT competitions as you can see everywhere. We'll make those a bit more... Interesting. For each of them, an original ruleset will make you race in unusual ways, whether it'd be doing the same strats as an old WR, use a vehicle that isn't good on the track, take paths that no one hardly even sees or complete certain tasks before finishing your run. The possibilities are endless!”</i><br><br>So, what do you think? Are you ready to grab your Wiimote and shoot for the Moon? The first Event of Season One has already started on N64 Mario Raceway and lasts until June 25th, so hurry up if you want to participate! You can join our Discord server right here to do so: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/hsckuxE8SJ\">https://discord.gg/hsckuxE8SJ</a><br><br><br>On the more… Technical side of TTing. I’d even say the more robotic side of TTing. A pretty huge discovery was made around May 9th by well-known TASer Monster: A new, faster movement on outside-drifting bikes that will later be called “Superhopping”. Very briefly, it consists of starting a drift then hopping back and forth with a left-right movement on the analog stick. Obviously, these left-right inputs are EXTREMELY precise and the hop must be a neutral hop without any direction held on the stick, hence why this isn’t viable for RTA. The whole TT scene was relieved because no one was seeing themselves going for that insane (and honestly as weird) strat and changing the meta to outside-drifting bikes… It has some interest for TAS though and the uses of it are very cool in my opinion. You can check it out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CS_1klWMybI\">here!</a><br><br><br>But what about we dive into what RTA Top-Level Karters achieved this News Cycle? May wasn’t a very stacked month of WR improvements but we still got 9 WRs (6 3lap and 3 Flap) on 8 categories by 6 different players. Here’s all of it…<br><br>At first we went to the big ol’ Stadium of the W, where Connor once again found the way to success by getting a 1:48.275 in No-Glitch on May 7th, skipping 1:48.3 entirely. He himself says this run is really strong, only seeing mistakes on the turn leading to the zipper laps 2 and 3, and takes a well-deserved break from the track. Great job Connor, it’s looking more and more like Waluigi Stadium is now your property.<br><br>He’s cursed! On both categories of his Ace Track! Jared 2000 gets another WR on BC Shortcut on May 11th, but it’s not the one he wanted… It’s a 2:09.010. 11ms away from the milestone on the 11th btw, pretty interesting (WR run on a 1st when). The most heartbreaking thing is that he got plenty of other runs that could’ve subbed after this one, and ALL of them failed at the end, one even was at the very last geyser trick. Hopefully the sub comes soon!<br><br>Remember when we all thought Luke’s rSGB WR was so good it’d stand for months? Well we were all so, so wrong that this new WR beats it by more than a second. After weeks of grinding, Top 10 Karter Vincent Nguyen became also on May 11th the first person to sub 1:15 on this category, with an astonishing 1:14.513, claiming his 2nd ever WR after losing his only GV2 Glitch WR to Logan! Man was so relieved he sent out a full-on ESSAY of almost 10k characters (hey it is I that does that normally!) and it’s honestly very understandable. Congrats on this huge WR Vincent!<br><br>Slowly but surely, we’re gonna see a 1:50 being performed on GV No-Glitch this year. Barney continued his journey to the Sub, getting this month in one improvement to a 1:51.021, on the 19th. This is his 11th consecutive WR on the category, as he has now cut .5 off this track alone. Place your bets on whenever he’ll get the 1:50 Karters!<br><br> And speaking of bets, you can also place them for Goldmine’s 1:49 in No-Glitch, as Luke has once again improved a bit late in the month to a 1:50.037 on May 29th. He seems to have detached from the other “Big 3” of this track, as Logan, Vincent and Justin all are at a mid .1. They can all claim the first 1:49 though as they’re all close to it, so we’ll see what the future holds for us in the coming weeks…<br><br>The earth has shaken. And that made the Maple leaves fall. But the cause of this earthquake isn’t natural nor is it the art of a Ground type Pokémon, it is the result of another godly run by the Treeway’s Master, Speed64Demon. We saw in March’s News Update that he had come pretty close to getting the holy 2:13, setting a time less than .1 away from the milestone, however we weren’t ready for what the now 20-time MT No Glitch World Champion had to offer. Karters and Kartesses. Not only did he get the sub 2:14. He almost got the sub 2:13 with an INSANE 2:13.126 on May 22nd. A 3/3 shroom turnskip that’s nothing short of incredible to extend his lead over 2nd place French player Victor to a whopping 2.6 seconds. The Master rules the race track alone as he’s been doing for more than 2000 days.<br><br>FLAPS. FLAPS. FLAPS. They’re the best categories as everyone knows… and we got 3 new ones to talk about this month! At first we got Jared, of course on BC Shortcut, that aligned together a Flap of 41.885 3 days before getting his 3lap, on May 8th. Luke did the opposite as the first improved his WGM 3lap before attempting the Flap, and reclaimed his crown from Logan with 2 WRs on the same day of June 2nd, a 35.366 and 35.295 respectively, perfecting his run with the new strats. And that’s it for this month!<br><br>A little word as always on our current WR timesheet, as always our oldest Flap WR remains Liam’s rDH No-SC run that’s been at the top since January 30th, 2016 and sitting at 2300+ days, and as for 3lap the change is that Luke’s DC has now passed 1000 days! It is his first ever WR to do so and the next time to potentially do so is also one of his, as MC3 stands now at 952 days.<br><br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> It’s been hard to decide, but this month I’ll give this award to <font color=yellow>Australia</font> as the first country to get the title twice. Although they didn’t break any huge records, almost all players were active this month, as Mitch, Matthew, Obeisant, Bawp, Rogue, Falco, hell, even Narumi and Nscr were active this month. Basically we’re only missing Felix, StarBoi and Jyran. Also, Mitch and Obeisant made great progress on the charts, so I don’t see why I wouldn’t give them the award.<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>TRACK OF THE MONTH:</u></font> This month has seen a pretty diverse track activity, so you can’t really pick a TotM that easily… But for how huge this month’s WR was I decided to pick <font color=yellow>Maple Treeway</font>. Seeing a 2:13 performed in itself is insane, so imagine when it’s a damn POINT ONE. Demon’s just a god at this track really.<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=#999999><i>\"If i see any motherfucker in this server in a mogi while we are trying to gather for a war, you will be kicked.

Alongside that he improved his weaker No-SC timesheet by playing MT for a 2:20.1 (go get that sub!) and rYF for an excellent 59.358. Great job as always, I wonder when the David bop will come…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#9</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#17</font>) <font color=yellow>Vincent Nguyen</font> also worked on his No-SC timesheet after setting his rSGB, getting times such as 1:56.7 CM and 2:22.7 BC and establishing himself more and more as a true member of the Top 10, lowering the gap to #8 Thomas van Deerse. Go get him!<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Leading Karters (11-50)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#11</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#9</font>) <font color=yellow>Bynt</font> finished his work on DC from last month with a 1:29.247 then went all-in on the Spear tracks, grinding MC No-Glitch night and day to get a 1:20. Man already has a 1:21.083 that’s 5th WW but seeing how he got a 24.853 2nd WW on the Flap that to him “Has mistakes” and “Can be improved”... Bynt4WR I say. Alongside it and to not lose interest in MC by playing it too much he went to SGB and got a 1:21.840, 8th American. Passing 2 people at once this update, Bynt is coming closer and closer to the holy <font color=#33AADD>#10</font> spot… Will he be the one to kick out Totom?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#13</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#15</font>) <font color=yellow>Zed R</font> only submitted 2 times, a good 1:42.317 on rMR and a way better 1:48.020 on DDR, 6th European and less than .07 away from Worldwide Tops and .071 from his CR held by Kenny.

Great runs this month Thunder!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#22</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#22</font>) <font color=yellow>Indy Kambeitz</font> played 3laps this month, getting times on RR (2:28.2), KC (2:20.3) and rDKM (2:04.7) and passing Steve on the Combined charts.

Congrats on the achievement!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#38</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#87</font>) <font color=yellow>Hydr8ion</font> improved exclusively on rMC Flap, setting a 28.846 on May 7th.

A classic.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#47</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#85</font>) <font color=yellow>Hunter Wells</font> barely played this month after setting his SGB run I talked about last News Update, only setting a TF Shortcut Flap of 33.554 and a tiny rPG of 2:01.9. He still managed to stay afloat and even cut one placement, I guess that’s how glitching works!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#49</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#80</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Loerzel</font> is very lucky because I just saw I included his only run of this News Cycle, a 1:36.9 on rSL Glitch with 1/3 clips, in the last News Update.

On the improvement list are MH with a 1:44.9 (nice sub but go for more please the track’s pretty good I’d say), CM with a 1:58.2 and most importantly DDR with a really cool 1:49.6. I think if you focus on rPG and BC3 this month you should get that top pretty soon, so go get those PBs and go cut that AF!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#57</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#63</font>) <font color=yellow>Shane Hogan</font> jumped on the Spear this month as he played MC No-Glitch for a 1:22.0 / 25.3 (that Flap has a Myth standard btw) and both rPB categories for a 1:06.9 / 1:13.3, enough to keep his spot safe and cut a bit of AF. Sadly he announced that he probably won’t be as active in the coming months and will focus on categories he’s best at… Honestly it’s perfectly okay as I said before, hopefully you manage to keep your spot on the rankings my friend! <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#67</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#60</font>) <font color=yellow>Claus</font> got a pretty nice time of 2:20.846 on KC alongside a 44.7 Flap, still only the 3rd Updater time Hydr8ion beats you!1!! Also, a 2:02.7 on BC3 Shortcut is pretty nice considering you beat me by 3 seconds lmfao I’m trash but hey 3 spots gained for 3 PRs is always good to see<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#68</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#45</font>) <font color=yellow>Alberto Barba</font> is halfway there to regain his holy <font color=#33AADD>#69</font> spot. This month he played rWS for a 1:52.0 and rDKM for a 2:07.7, solid times but could you just stop PBing so one single Karter passes you? That’d be great thank you<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#76</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#48</font>) <font color=yellow>Watcha</font> only played a single Flap category this News Cycle, a flat 36.700 on rWS… Yet that suffices him to cut just under 1 AF, work smarter not harder Karters<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#79</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#123</font>) <font color=yellow>Nate Schultz</font> played a bunch of 3laps here and there, getting PRs such as 2:09.7 rDKM, 1:09.8 LC beating the oldest time in his timesheet and most impressively 2:22.8 BC No-SC… Yet he only lost 1 AF because he focused on Red Charts and that’s the best thing ever. Keep up like this Nate!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#83</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#55</font>) <font color=yellow>ArthurOww</font> scared himself a little this month. After failing to further improve his DC, he went to rMR in the 2nd half of the month to try and get French Tops on the track… Problem was, he didn’t succeed! Aiming for a 1:42.632 he only got to a 1:42.908. And on the 30th I hadn’t gotten any French Top for the month, exposing my monthly streak to its end… Then I made a glorious move. Having never seriously touched the track with this vehicle before, I went to rSGB on Spear to claim the French Top there. I had a 1:23.595 with Magikruiser, the Top was a 1:23.035. After 4 AND A HALF HOURS of almost non-stop TTing I learned how to handle the Spear on this, failing several Tops paces with my best being a .5 / .4 pace that could’ve ended with a 1:22.5xx if I didn’t hit the crabs on lap 3 after the shroom. Then on the last day, I didn’t have much time in my agenda, but went all-in to preserve my streak. And after 2 hours, I had finally gotten a run to end well… Beating 10th French by 34ms with a 1:23.001. No I don’t care about the sub and yes I will improve that for sure in the coming weeks. However I won’t end this without mentioning that I played the worst category ever that’s MG Glitch after setting my rSGB, finished in 30 minutes a trash 46.7 I could improve by loads, cut 350+ placements combining 3lap and Flap and passed quite a few people with that… Now I understand how these kids were beating me.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#84</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Ethan Hedley</font> is apparently working on his… NO-GLITCH TIMESHEET OH MY GOD FINALLY you still have to finish it though lmao. Play those damn Flaps smh! Highlights are a 1:22.3 on MC and a big 2:04.810 on rSL No-Glitch that’s his best Red Chart ranking on 3lap by a landslide congrats on the sub! He’s recently gone back to glitches to try and land the rBC Glitch though… And he’s made it… Only, to, in a moment of panic, break under the pressure and more precisely under a Thwomp. He ended up not even getting UK Tops with that run. As heartbreaking as this attempt was for him though, he hasn’t given up yet! And will try to land the glitch a second time, without dying afterwards of course. Will he succeed? Will he get crushed again? All will be revealed in the next News Update…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#88</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#82</font>) <font color=yellow>Neptune</font> went on a journey on MC this month and finished with a time of 1:21.6, 10th American not bad for someone who’s bad at driving I admit it but oh would you look at that he gets a 1:29.9 on DC but I HAVE A .8 GET OWNED you really suck at driving dude get better! Jokes aside, let me remind you that our bet still holds, and if I manage to somehow sub 40 on CM you’d have to do the same on WGM…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#86</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>JAYOO</font>, just as Core, still has to play those Flaps to complete his No-SC Timesheet but he’s been playing for Red Charts this month, improving on CM, BC, rSL, rDS and especially rPB with a 1:13.6 for his first No-SC Top 100 time nice stuff! He did also play the Glitch part of the track setting a 1:07.3 but I don’t care because FORZA NO-SC!!!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#93</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#84</font>) <font color=yellow>Clip80</font> subbed the minute on rYF with a 59.901, always a great feeling when you get subs like this great work!

The wheeler literally cut 50 placements this News Cycle to enter Top 100. I can’t even give you highlights there are too many runs to choose from! rDH Shortcut 1:35.1, MC Glitch 57.1, RR Flap 47.6… Yet I see no form of interest for Red Charts sadly. Now that you’ve hit Top 100 you have nothing to do on the Combined charts so finish at least your No-SC timesheet! <br><br><br><font color=red><u>Noticeable Karters (101-200)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#113</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#62</font>) <font color=yellow>Acquiesce</font> the Kiwi went on his Diveless DC Journey this month, and he surely got a good time… 1:29.536 I’d love to get this time! …Okay maybe like 3ms better because it’s EU Tops but you got it lmao. After this time he track-hopped a ton, setting PRs left and right including on rDKM with a nice 2:07.3 man I love to see this type of cracked timesheet I say that everytime but I really mean it yours is so good keep that pace up you’ll surely get Top 100 by playing some of those Flaps!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#114</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#134</font>) <font color=yellow>Kjeld van Keulen</font> is back again to not get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of promising Karters passing him recently! The Dutch regains 4 spots with 3 PRs including a great 2:29.9 on RR congrats on the big sub! Mainly playing for AF of course, he also worked on his worst tracks like rPB or MH (nice I’m sure you can sub 1:45 on that one). By the way, I’ve recently played MKSC as a “challenge” for the Karter Contest and I’ve noticed that there’s someone on those leaderboards called… Ben van Keulen! A brother or a cousin maybe?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#116</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Enzo Leussink</font> jumped like Idriz but not as much, only by 30 placements the wheeler really makes it look like a normal thing when it clearly isn’t. He got pretty solid times like MC3 1:18.6, rGV2 53.4 or rMR 1:42.9 congrats on sub, with his best coming from MC Glitch where he set a 57.4.

This time, it’s on rMC that the action took place! Coming from the depths of the leaderboard, Nara progressively catched up, sometimes setting one PR per day, to finally breakthrough with, of course, enough luck because this track’s a slot machine, and a really cool 1:32.401 that makes Canadian Tops just barely at 10th place. Another Episode of Road to 32/32 Canadian Tops in the bag! But that’s not everything, as he also played several other tracks like Moonview for a 1:44 (nice sub!), rPB and Parkway Glitches for some free AF, and he even surprised me by playing Red Charts with a BC3 No-SC time! A great month, hopefully the next few ones end up as good as this one!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#135</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#104</font>) <font color=yellow>Jadid</font> played a bit but lost a placement, even with a great CM Glitch time of 36.8. I guess the other 2 tracks you played, SGB with a 1:23.4 and BC3 Shortcut with a 2:03.1 could’ve been improved further… <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#164</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#126</font>) <font color=yellow>Blue B#</font> didn’t play for the Blue Charts this month, only setting 2 No-SC times first on BC with a decent 2:24.1 then lowering his Ace Track WGM further into the 1:51.0 territory, hopefully the sub comes as quickly as possible!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#175</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#78</font>) <font color=yellow>Kenneth Bernales</font> only submitted a single time, but it’s a pretty good one since it’s a 2:32.5 on rBC… Yeah No-SC only Core and Logan are crazy enough to go for the Glitch don’t worry lmao. Still that gets the job done for appearing in the News Update, what else can you ask for?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#177</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#137</font>) <font color=yellow>Daniel W</font> is our highest-ranked timesheeter this News Cycle as I said before, welcome to the Leaderboard!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#188</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#158</font>) <font color=yellow>James Collins</font>, as others, went on a Journey to get a certain Country Top (that for him even is a Continental Top, you privileged Karter!). And when you know the track we’re talking about is the holy Road of Moonview Highway, you KNOW you’re in for a ride… Both playing the track and reading this as I’m writing it. Not feeling like using Flame Runner, the Aussie decided to play this track the old way, using the Spear on Automatic drift. He remarked something pretty interesting about his Country Top early in his grind though: if he got on that Top 10, the Karter he’d kick out was a certain “Tn”, former Top-level player whose 1:44.560 run dated from… February 13th, 2009. The oldest run on any Australian leaderboard. A huge feat that was to clear this run off of his Country Tops then… His level on the track quickly showed his potential, although he didn’t finish many of his runs… It had almost become a joke how whenever James would post something MH-related, it’d be another one of his lap 3 fails. The pressure was on. Once with an insane pace that would’ve been enough, the vehicle hit a yellow car after the bridge lap 3, only by a couple pixels, and the run was over. Was it too much for Obeisant to handle such a task? That’s what we all thought when he began to submit times from other tracks, playing glitches such as MG with a 44.4 or WGM with a 42.2. But he still had that little light in his mind… I think it was the moonlight that watched over him on the Highway. He thus only took a little break and resumed his grind… Only to fail again, on an even better pace, this time not on the yellow car, not even on the blue truck on the tunnel’s blind turn, but really on the blue car driving across the road on the last straight. In a moment of panic, he didn’t know how to avoid it. On the verge of giving up, he then remembered my advice from last News Update… The only thing was to get a good lap 3 and he’d get it instantly. With this boost of motivation, he thus went to lap 3 again. And, for once, he did not choke. 34.8 / 34.6 / 34.8 and that’s a huge 1:44.323, 5th Oceanian, crushing the oldest time still on Oceanian Tops, and getting his 2nd Top 100 time after his other Ace Track Shy Guy Beach. What a Journey. My deepest congratulations to you James, this is the type of Karting moments that define your career altogether… I hope you learned many things from this grind, and may you shine again the same way, several times from many years to come!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#191</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#131</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Hurley</font> successfully entered Top 200 this News Cycle with 10 PRs and a 14 AF cut! To extend his lead over the other Bens he most notably played rDS and subbed 2:07 (I agree how could you have a 2:07 on DKM yet also on rDS lol), missed the sub on DC with a 1:31.020 and Glitched BC3 for a 2:03.7, with a 39.997 Flap nice sub! You’ve been more active than in the prior News Cycles… Is it because of the Top 200? Or maybe you’re starting to get a little sweaty from that new opponent… <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#192</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>WK Sozi</font>, what a resurgence! All his times literally are from January 1st… 2012, then you have 2 Combined times and a bunch of No-SC times from May 9th of this year. No one ever quits MKW for good Karters and Kartesses, that’s how good this game is! The highlight of this first PB batch in a whole decade for me is a 2:15.1 on DKJP, surely if you play the Flap you’ll get\ta good placement…<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Average Karters (201-300)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#210</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#188</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Busche</font> broke through and cut 8 placements to steal 2nd place in the Ben rankings from Brophy! What a move! Notable times are a 1:54.2 on DDR and a 1:33.2 on rMC, improving your weakest times to cut as much AF as possible that’s the strat I love to see! Keep it up and you’ll match Hurley in no time.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#213</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#139</font>) <font color=yellow>Mystogan</font> timesheets his way onto the rankings! Coming from 200cc CTs the PP experience must be very changing, I hope you like it!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#214</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#147</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Brophy</font> almost didn’t make it in time for the News Update! The American Football enjoyer went back to work with several No-SC 3laps including BC with a 2:25.0 (ranked 300 :o), CM with a 1:59.6 (gratz on sub) and TF with a 1:51.6 you almost beat me I have a flat .600 that’s good! Glad to see you back, hopefully your first year of College went very well!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#222</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Sam Fairless</font> only got one single time this update, but it’s a big one as the well-known glitcher found that using Bullet Bike on CM Flap wasn’t the dumbest of ideas, and even managed to hit a 4.256, 2nd Worldwide with it! Will we see Justin’s 4.251 WR finally dethroned after more than 6 years? Only time will tell!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#225</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#119</font>) <font color=yellow>Pabloski</font> played a bit of MH at the start of the month to get a nice 1:44.9 then went on BC and surprised me with a 2:23.5 that one’s a good one… The Catalonian then worked on MC for the rest of the month, setting a big 1:22.2 that’s his 5th 3lap Top 100 time, slowly but surely getting up there, congrats and keep the pace up, even with few glitches I’m sure you can get that Top 200!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#230</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#151</font>) <font color=yellow>Xenophanes</font> only submitted a single 1:53.7 on DDR and thus lost 2 spots on the rankings, pretty sad but that’s the hard thing about not improving in that part of the leaderboard<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#231</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#165</font>) <font color=yellow>Cederic</font> improved a ton this month, as always, mainly improving on Flaps as he set among others a 36.183 on WGM No-Glitch, ranked 56th as his first Red Chart time to reach Top 100, congrats! He’s also shown a pretty huge potential on rSGB, getting a 1:23.221 but having already failed several Country Top paces, some even good enough for a 5th or 6th place at a 1:22.7… As I said for Obeisant last time, you only need one run.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#250</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#161</font>) <font color=yellow>Supreme</font> barely sneaks into Top 250 thi News Cycle by getting 18 PRs, cutting a whole 46 AF and passing 33 people. That’s quite the work. Among his new times we find some 1:30.9 DC nice sub, 2:01.8 rPG pretty high-ranked and 59.9 rYF that’s some good stuff! Playing a few flaps probably also kinda carried this jump tbh, you should work on them a bit more if you want to climb the ranks fast! <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#257</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#173</font>) <font color=yellow>Evilninja</font> worked on his Ace Track MC No-Glitch this month, to get the sub 1:22 with a 1:21.919 you love to see it! Along with that he followed Bynt’s trace and also went to rSGB, this time for a 1:22 that he did achieve setting a .989, and played a bit of WGM No-Glitch to get himself a 1:53.3. Nice work to cut 14 placements on the charts!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#280</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#187</font>) <font color=yellow>Aimee Scaricordi</font> played WGM as well, getting pretty close to Evilninja with a 1:53.4, then focused on improving her CM Glitch. With all the dedication that the Maltese threw into the category, she managed to hit a beautiful 36.844 3lap paired with a 4.660 Flap, both top 100 times and her first ones on the Combined Charts! That feels like the start of a great career, trust me… Good luck for your future Karting Projects!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#291</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#199</font>) <font color=yellow>ElecTrick</font> worked on a few tracks here and there, setting a few times here and there… Okay moving on… What do you say? I missed something c’mon I’m late it’s not even gonna be a huge deal anyw… Oh. Oh well. Who would’ve thought? He went on MT Glitch this month, right? UK/Ireland tops are like a 2:06.3 by Luke Berrill, Wii Wheel WW Tops are evenly the same, I have a 2:09.1 myself in comparison, he uses the wheel as well, surely he can’t get any Tops, right? No shot. He got both. Yes, fucking both of them. He himself couldn’t even believe it! I mean, when the Master Shane Hogan, 6th WW, gives you tips and advice, you can get really far, and that’s what he just did! With a 2:05.314, ElecTrick gets his first ever UK/IRE Tops with a 10th place AND his first ever Wii Wheel Tops as well with a better 7th place among big names such as Victor, Alberto, Danny G or Jongwoo. Always believe, Karters! As ElecTrick’s BGM choice in his record’s vid, the shape that will take your career has “Endless Possibilities”... It is yourself that determines alone which one it’ll be.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#292</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#176</font>) <font color=yellow>Jesse Jay</font> storms into top 300 as she was barely in the top 350 last News Update?! Well that’s a nice move! One new time I’m noticing is that 28.7 on DC Flap, that’s ranked 66th… Not bad at all for a player of your ranking, keep it up!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#295</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#183</font>) <font color=yellow>Ragemodepigeon</font> didn’t play for the whole month, only setting a duo of 1:43.7 / 32.7 for MG No-SC on the 8th of May. He thus lost a whole 3 spots because of it, hurry! If you don’t improve at least some of your times you’re gonna be kicked out of Top 300!<br> <br><br><font color=red><u>Karters in the Making (300+)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#304</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#208</font>) <font color=yellow>Graden</font> gets 16 PRs, climbs up 16 placements, and cuts 16 AF.

Fucking SEVENTY-ONE SPOTS GAINED since last News Update. Man literally improved almost his entire timesheet, AGAIN since he already did that in April!

Flaps are the best and you’ll never change my mind!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#319</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#198</font>) <font color=yellow>Ivo Bril</font> BARELY makes it into this News Update. Long story short, the parser only detects times from the Combined charts, and since Ivo only submitted 2 No-SC times on MC of 1:22.882 and 25.800, 3lap and Flap, the Stats Page didn’t mark him at first… I just so happened to be testing some things with our date system to know exactly what times are taken into account for a date X, and put June 3rd as the end date instead of June 2nd as it normally is, then I saw him highlighted! Checked his profile and, even though he has times from the 3rd I can’t talk about since it’s not from this News Cycle, I was able to notice his MC improvements. The parser surely works weirdly…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#351</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#190</font>) <font color=yellow>Pablo Hernangómez</font> the Spanish MG expert that the Stats Page hates because it can’t read the ó finishes his timesheet this month! Feliz Karting!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#360</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Greg Finke</font> continued his rYF journey and ended it, with a monstrous 59.246, standing out immensely from the rest of his timesheet. Beautiful work, the idea now would be to do the same for all the 31 other tracks now! Good luck :D<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#373</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#218</font>) <font color=yellow>Ncsr.</font> takes a hiatus from the game. As he announced himself as “half retired”, he only submitted 3 times this News Cycle, working mostly on DKS… It’s a whole Arc of our Player Page Journey that makes its final breath. In the end, in this raging rivalry between Ncsr and Johnson Turkey, it’s the first one that took over the top spot, and although James Collins once rivaled them, he’s now too far away to be considered as part of this duel anymore. Karters and Kartesses, a moment of silence for this closing page of our History. May many more battles and rivalries bloom in the years to come… <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#393</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#209</font>) <font color=yellow>Zevohno</font> smashes the Top 400 with 21 PRs and a 21 AF cut!

You’ll have to work harder, I guess…?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#473</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Desmond-Hooper</font>, him, manages to stay afloat with only one more PR than the Swedish. Losing literally 0.8 AF, he still lost a placement due to other people passing him. C’mon people, the Karter with the most Gentleman name of all the Leaderboard needs to be placed at least a bit higher! Stop beating him smh my head!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#475</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#259</font>) <font color=yellow>Charlotte Crego</font> the MKDD enthusiast sadly lost pretty early in her Karter Contest, beaten in the Superb 64 round of the bracket by <font color=#11FFBB>#53</font> seed Kazuya Tagushi, 27-29 votes as she was <font color=#11FFBB>#12</font> seed… Sometimes you have days like this, I’m sure you’ll shine in the next one! <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#478</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#246</font>) <font color=yellow>Vincent Kwiecien</font> followed the same fate as Charlotte in the KC although it wasn’t really an upset: <font color=#11FFBB>#5</font> seed TvK was just too good for him. But hey, you still only lost by 13 votes, as I had the <font color=#11FFBB>#6</font> seed to face me and lost by a whole 21… We’ll all get our revenge in the next edition, I’m sure of it! KC 2K24, see you in 2 years!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#509</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#263</font>) <font color=yellow>Chansey</font> probably ate all 6 X-Attacks she needed to hit the leaderboard this hard, you know this item is banned in competitive play right?! Cutting a whole 97 AF (don’t you feel like an HM slave using that move so much?) and stalling through 60 people, the Tank improved half her timesheet. Top 500 will soon fall for sure, will there ever be a Ghost-type milestone that you wouldn’t be able to hit?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#541</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#275</font>) <font color=yellow>Ketchup</font> comes back! The Automatic Condiment that we missed since January “temporarily” resurrected with a work on rSL No-Glitch, getting his Automatic Tops back in 3laps with a 2:12.4 and, as always, PBing for Flap in the same run with a 43.734. Welcome back, even if it might only be for a few weeks! <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#623</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#286</font>) <font color=yellow>Luke Norman</font> passes 7 people and cuts 8 AF with only 4 PRs, pretty rare to see at this level tbh, the start of a “Main Character Immunity” maybe?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#657</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#307</font>) <font color=yellow>LOWERCASE</font> PLAYED THE GAME OMG OMG OMG OMG AND SET 4 PRS WITH THAT oh but he still lost 5 AF and 4 placements bruh. Still, this is an historic day. It’s like the first time he played twice in the span of like 2 months, and this time he improved his BC further from 2:30 to 2:29 OMG HE GOT THE SUB then played MC… GLITCH OH GOD and he gets a 13 second Flap that’s like 250th-ish, actually his best ranked time by a landslide (yes I stopped screaming because my throat hurts) congrats Lowercase! With enough work and a better understanding of how the game plays and controls I’m sure you could skyrocket on these charts… You just gotta believe!<br><br><br><br>And just like that, May’s News is done! Since I’ve been writing these alone for all of 2022 thus far and to focus more on other projects like the Masters Tour or my personal timesheet (not to mention I’m also passing my French finals in literally 2 weeks), the next few News Updates will be written by other Updaters! For everyone that joined this year and only know of my News Updates, you’re in for a ride especially with certain Updaters… I’d say I’m not even the best writer. You’ll be blessed if you get a News from… him.<br><br>That is all for me my dear Karters and Kartesses, I’ll still be there updating your times and all don’t worry, but yeah writing the News takes so much time and effort and I’ve done 5 in a row I prefer hand over to my other co-workers for me to get some rest and for you to get some change.

I thought I'd touch less grass and do a news update in place of my actually active new people! I'm going to keep this fairly brief, so let's get into this. HOWEVER< this one is going to be a bit different. Due to all of our news updaters being depressed and demotivated, we’ve now done a collaboration for this one. Hopefully, news should be coming out more quickly and with more consistency from here on. Here goes!<br><br><br><br><i>This news update covers from June 1st, 2022 to July 31st, 2022</i><br><br><br><font color=lime>We've had 20 New Players this month:<br><br>Sauna Boi (Recognizable from being in twitch chats 24/7)<br>Dylan Lepeirtz (Adding on to the random Dylans on the board)<br>Ash Lovett (Great at slip drifts, terrible at mini turbos)<br>Willy (Barely does not add to the list of Wills)<br>Nidhryl (Has a 2:05 on rPG glitch!)<br>Leila FalB Massanova (Going for Italian tops)<br>TristanUK  (Joined for Maple Treeway)<br>Lvxclayy (Clayy gonna Slayy the ranks)<br>Charlie Brennan (Will kick the football eventually)<br>Jason Vardy (Ready to machete his way up the boards every Friday)<br>Christos Karamanos (Not Kasperinos, as a glance at the name would suggest)<br>3rdmatt (The next update to 2ndmatt)<br>Anonymous (Undoxxed... for now)<br>Mel Luna (Another CM glitch carry)<br>Pedro V.

The strength of this run cannot be understated. Congrats, Petah!<br><br>Bowser's Castle has finally gotten its cursed sub 2:09, with a 2:08.951. However, the record was not by Jared, Blaze didn't come back for it, and Logan didn't do the whole Logan thing. This one is by CURRY MAN, EMIL! Emil becomes a multi world record holder with this one, and brings the category back to Funky for the first time in over a decade. I look forward to seeing your next mickey mouse world record. Congrats, Emil!<br><br>Jared may have lost his beloved blue chart Bowser Castle, but he improved his lead in the red charts by hitting a 2:20.359 out of nowhere. The 2:19 grows ever so slightly closer. Though, we may be seeing a battle for it very soon. Keep going, Jared!<br><br>Remember that crazy 1:15.483 Moo Moo Meadows time of Sosis' from November 2019? Well, Kasey played Flame Runner for like, not even a week and got a 1:15.441. Kasey gets what Kasey wants, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. Great run, Kasey!<br><br>(Cue Arthur)<br> <br>Hey what's up Karters and Kartesses it's Arthur, now guess what since procrastination from the entire Updating Crew entering July got us to delay the update for a month I have to write the WR News for this month, yes this Update is a combined work of the whole PP squad but is the most delayed one of the year so far I know that doesn't make any sense! Anyway back to the WRs<br><br>Just before July, we got a weather prediction on Twitter. Logan posted a simple image stating \"Road to 20 unique tracks\", with all the tracks he has had at least 1 WR on, plus 6 cows meaning these spots had to be filled. With the message he sent with it, \"starting next month\", the whole community saw the thing coming. Logan was about to pull, not just a Logan, but multiple…<br><br>Starting on rBC3, the newest Player's Page Champion did the unthinkable. We were all shocked by Emil getting his first WR back in January with a 2/3 shroomless shortcut run, but some of us literally jumped off of their chairs when they saw that Logan not only got the first 3/3 shroomless shortcut run, but also smashed the WR with a 1.346 second cut (the biggest since… August 2008), ending at a 1:55.715 completely skipping 1:56. Asserting dominance.<br><br>If I tell you we just jumped from a 2:17.937 to a 2:17.547 on KC Non-SC would you believe me? Well, quite a few didn't when Luke shared his latest WR on July 10th, completely smashing his former WR and getting the biggest cut since Fox subbing 2:19 in 2016. It was all thanks to a relatively new strat, discovered by everyone's favorite Wii Wheel extraordinaire Jongwoo and used by him in his runs that consists quite literally of driving on the wall in the underwater section. I'm starting to feel like KC is from MK8. Luke's goal is a .3, but he's got some serious competition lately as Jongwoo is quite determined to take back his record and has been on the grind for several weeks, climbing as high as 9ms off the #1 spot. With all that timesave on the horizon, it would be nice to see a battle between the two here, we haven't had a big one in so long…<br><br>Logan. Ok that's it I'm out<br><br>No seriously he's everywhere. He did warn us that he was gonna take multiple records but annihilate Bickbork's chances for an rMC world record? With a monstrous 1:30.272? Seriously dude? And on top of that, he does the unthinkable by performing the GLITCH, \"un\"fortunately with 2 shrooms so instead of a 3lap run he gets the Flap WR by almost .2 with a 28.269. I'm starting to fear we might get into a situation similar to what MK64 had with both MR and Dan…<br><br>The King is back to reclaim his property. The throne of Bowser's Castle doesn't belong to Jared in the end, but indeed to the true Master of the track Zeke! The Japanese BC God beats the American with a powerful 2:20.099 ever so slightly off of the 2:19 milestone that's been overdue for Zeke for so long. I have no idea what this track will offer us in the near future, but one thing is clear: whoever subs 2:20 will mark his name in this game's Hall of Fame.<br><br>Remember that nice little paragraph Pear just wrote a few lines earlier? Kasey getting MMM WR? Well, a certain someone named Sosis got mad, started playing the track right after and got a 1:15.375 on the 21st, shutting the mouth of the rPB WR holder. <br><br>The CM GOAT has returned once again! Braixen casually dropped a 31.311 (nice digits) on July 25th, \"only\" beating his former WR by .024 but HOLD ON, the man has stated that he was going for a 31.1! Quite the goal, but it's Braixen on CM so some could even argue it isn't his full potential… We'll see what he ends up with in the next few News Updates then<br><br>Man is on a mission. On his 4-wheeled bike, Japanese legend Kaede continues to bring Rainbow Road closer and closer to the holy sub 2:24.5 with a 2:24.502 on July 28th. Very active on Twitter, he's said that he would retire from the game once he hit his subbing goal… is this his final chapter? I mean, we always say nobody quits the game for good…<br><br>A wild Justin has appeared! Justin used \"let me just drop this new WR out of nowhere\"! Super effective! …Yeah, Justin doing the Justin thing as we all know. This time, it's on DDR, with a 1:46.841 set on July 30th that's always a pleasure to watch because Top level DDR runs are very cool. See you whenever you feel like WRing again Justin!<br><br>And that's it for the 3lap WRs this month! I'll let the fruit talk about the Flaps…<br><br>For Flaps then, we saw the introduction of a new low trick on that one boost ramp for Bowser Castle 3, allowing for some big flap improvements. We now have a 44.178 by Luke. Great stuff<br><br>(Decue Arthur, cue Pear)<br><br>Also, Shane Hogan used the new MICKEY MOUSE strat on CM to take down Justin's very long time flap from 2016. This may be a cool achievement, but something something something Grumble Volcano, Shane! I bet you've never heard that from me before<br><br>(Redecue Pear, cue Arthur)<br><br>Hey this is Arthur writing this part a couple weeks later, apparently Shane heard Pear write this last thing as the man got a monstrous 2.881 just a couple days ago on July 31st beating Jyran’s former WR by over .250? That surely shocked everyone, especially Lowercase who once again screamed on his keyboard… When he does this you know you did great, so great job Shane!<br><br>The comeback has happened! Y'all probably remember Firestone, whether it'd be from seeing his name on mkwrs.com or having been playing a few years ago. Well, the good old Fire Flower pfp reclaimed his long lost DC Flap WR WR from Logan with a 28.110! Always nice to see former Top players getting times like this again, congrats Firestone! …No I won't ask \"now where's the 3lap WR\" but I strongly think it<br><br><br>With that out of the way let's get to the objectively best part of the News Update, I, Arthur, call the MOOOOOONTHLY STUFF<br><br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=yellow>The Netherlands</font> take it for the first time in June, profiting from a USA-centered activity. With players such as Enzo, Weexy or Ivo submitting loads of times together, including some quite strong ones, the title had to go in their hands… But for July I decided to go with something a little different. We thought their day was over, as they're not as dominant as they used to be… but they proved to the world they're still worthy. With Kaede on his way to make RR history and Zeke getting the BC crown back from Jared with an insane run bringing us closer and closer to a 2:19, <font color=yellow>Japan</font> gets the title! The icing on the cake would be Niyake reclaiming his #1 spot on GV Glitch… Yes I am waiting for that day to come. (Sorry Jyran)<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>TRACK OF THE MONTH:</u></font> For June, <font color=yellow>Bowser's Castle</font> earns it with 4 new WRs, 2 Non-SC flaps by Jared, 1 Non-SC 3lap also by Jared and 1 Combined 3lap by Emil, along with plenty of other people playing both categories including Fox, and even Zeke himself. In July however, we've seen a big activity on <font color=yellow>Mario Circuit</font> with many Karters improving their times including Sunkencrane, Enzo or Evilninja, the two latter ones getting onto WW Tops. Sadly Bynt hasn't gotten his 1:20 yet (probably because he spends all his time grinding everything BUT the track).<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=#999999>Why care about agriculture when you can eat cosmic brownies for every meal?</font> - <font color=yellow>VNix</font>, June 9th, 2022<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>ANCIENT QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=#999999>\"Nintendo, common sense… DOESN'T COMPUTE\"</font> - <font color=yellow>Inviso</font>, August 18th, 2009<br><br>(Cue Pear again, yes this news update is very organized)<br><br><font color=red>Top 10</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#1 LOGAN KEBABBY</font> Outside of the aforementioned records that Logan set, Logan also set a 1:28.497 Daisy Circuit (2nd), 1:15.624 Moo Moo Meadows (4th), 1:47.311 DK Summit (Tied-10th), and a 1:46.889 Dry Dry Ruins (2nd). He's also hit the first ever GCN Mario Circuit glitch, hitting a 28.269 flap record with it. Bickbork will not rest. Just unspeakable levels of skill. Looking forward to seeing what the future has in store, Logan!<br><br><font color=yellow>#2 Justin Hitchcock</font> Justin continues his low activity, however, finally improved upon that Dry Dry Ruins record, taking another chunk of time off taking it to a 1:46.841. This prevented Logan from interrupting Justin's reign, which is all the really matters. We hope to see more, Justin!<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Vincent Braixen</font> Just like Justin, Braixen claimed one new time after some time of little/no activity, coming out of essentially nowhere to improve CM glitch to a 31.311. Braixen has that 31.1 goal, which boggles the mind when watching any of the recent records. If anyone can do it, the pre-pubecscant glitch main can! Go<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Arvo Koskikallio</font> Arvo took advantage of the new MICKEY MOUSE shooting star strat and got a 4.1 flap on Coconut Mall, good enough for second place. Other times include 1:48.5 / 32.9 Dry Dry Ruins, and a 28.230 Daisy Circuit flap. Hopefully Arvo has not been using the karter's ghost as his own! Because that would be weird.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 Jack Gluesing</font> The Prodigy has been quite busy, landing plenty of personal bests over the last two months. The best ones include the Daisy Circuit times, with getting THE SUB with a 1:28.994, as well as a sudden 28.149 flap, good enough for third. Jack has also been playing Parkway for a 3/3 glitch time, hopefully you can stick with it long enough for that, Jack. Keep up the activity!<br><br><font color=yellow>#8 Vincent Nguyen</font> Vincent Nguyen has beaten me on Peach Gardens with a 2:00.052 and has lost my respect. I guess he also got FRAUD MICKEY MOUSE TIMES of 52.5 on MC glitch and 1:29.5 / 28.390 on DC. FRAUD<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Bynt.</font> Bynt has now entered the top 10, indicating the fall of society as we know it. We have failed. To understand how we were beaten (and how we can undo this fault), let's take a look at some of his new times: 2:27.945 RR (the famous bike sub), 23.977 MMM flap (gains .016 AF to me), 23.989 MC3 flap (cuts off .016 AF to me), 2:11.003 / 42.319 BC (only 2:08s are good), and 1:49.049 / 34.846 on DKS, among a handful of others. Good games Bynt, and lets get working on bopping this man<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Zed R</font> Zed played BC and got a 2:10.8, good enough for 8th EU.

Weexy is definitely an underrated player, yall keep an eye on him<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 Jake Harrison</font> Jake lost AF. epic 1:49.009 on DDR and 2:19.077 KC. no sub = difference in skill<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Dane Allen</font> Thunder entered the top 18, the most important list on the player's page.

He got the sub, ulike Jake!<br><br><font color=yellow>#30 MKRFirestone</font> Our favorite one record wonder has bumped up the activity as of recently, PBing on 8 categories and gaining another two spots to just break the top 30. We have a 1:48.9 on TF glitch, 2:05.7 rDS, a NEW WORLD RECORD FLAP of 28.110 flap on DAISY CIRCUIT WOOOO, a 52.5 on GV2 glitch, and a... a 1:54.5 rWS time. Well, perhaps some further activity can bring that down more. Everyone has their kryptonite. Go firestone<br><br><font color=yellow>#33 Ryley Carroll</font> A newly doxxed Hydr8ion is breaking away as BT's best player, getting some fast times like 1:50.8 on rWS and a 1:29.6 on DC, with some more quick flaps mixed in ranked between 16th and 21st.<br><br><font color=yellow>#35 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> Arrow lost AF.

It's been fun. I started off by playing rYF with flamerunner, beating my Spear time by .001 with a 59.938. I hit an unrecorded and unsaved 36.252 rWS flap, finally cashed in on a fraction of my Moo Moo potential with a 1:16.641 and a BIG 23.968 flap, which was huge to hit. I also played rPG again, finally hitting a consistent run with a 2:00.298 (1:59 coming in 2035), and I finally broke down and learned RR kart for a 2:29.283. Not sure what the future holds, I just kind of jump around based on how I'm feeling. idk man. game weird man. 2nd BT still <br><br><font color=yellow>#68 Claus</font> Third BT lost a spot but cut off AF. We love those months.

I hope our students' first few days back to school/uni are going well, and for those dinosaurs that are done with studies already I hope your summer was great! We’re back for some more News Update action, I know it's pretty late in the month but even us Player's Page Updaters have a social and personal life, I know it sounds crazy but trust me I haven't even got time to play this past week. Well, without any further delay, here's the Update!<br><br><u><i>So, what happened lately?</i></u><br><br>If we speak about the community, not very much to be honest, people come and go but the average member's IQ can't seem to stop decreasing<br><br>I can mention we have the 4th Event of the Masters Tour competition held on the Time Trial public Server currently taking place and running until September 21st, we're on rSL playing shroomless and using the ramp 3/3! If you're interested, the link to the server is in the forum's resources, the \"Useful resources for Time Trialing MKW\" thread, you'll find everything there.<br><br>We also got the long-awaited NMeade WR Review return covering the first 3 months of 2022! Last time we got one of these, it was the 2008 review in March so needless to say that everyone was pretty hype about it. And needless to say either, than being an NMeade vid, it was pretty damn good. Go watch it if you haven't already.<br><br>Oh btw Jesus Chri- uh I mean Mango Man is alive and well, he showed up in our Updating group chat and that's a News in itself because the Man is cool and it's even cooler to know he's doing great<br><br>Even if Master NMeade takes time to pour out his WR reviews, y'all Karters and Kartesses don't have to worry about not being up to date on the recent improvements… As we're doing the work for him here! What records did the Top players break in August?<br><br>Starting off the month, we went to KC to see Jongwoo reclaim his WR from Luke with a time of 2:17.361 on August 8th. This was mainly thanks to the new strat he discovered himself that we talked about last News Update, finally getting back WR with it after Luke improved his own record by .4 last month. Well done Jongwoo, we'll see if a 2:16 is performed here in the near future… <br><br>Multi-WR holder Kasey is back again! Darragh's resurgence didn't last long on rSGB, as Kasey gets not only 1, not only 2, but 3 new WRs this month, from a 1:21.451 to a 1:21.401 barely missing out on the .3. Sosis is still working hard on the track though, so prepare for a battle between the two. Who will come out on top?<br><br>He does it again! Poyo is back on the grind for WGM glitch, better than ever. He gets a bigger timecut this time, beating his previous WR by 12ms to finish a 31.837 run on the 20th. However, even if Logan doesn't seem to have interest over the category right now, new challenger Ray is climbing up the leaderboard very fast. Will the Spaniard be able to keep his throne? To be continued…<br><br>It's not the end of the News for that track though…<br><br>After months of speculation, close attempts and insane improvements, what surely is Wario's Gold Mine's last No-Glitch 10-second barrier has finally been broken, with Luke getting a 1:49.965 on the 27th! With Vincent B not really being a fan of the recent discoveries on what once was his Ace Track, Luke might keep his record a bit longer than expected, but who knows what will happen in the coming months, this category is quite open for any Top player to steal, from Logan to even Fox to a degree. May History bless us with the unexpected!<br><br>Then we got… KC. Glitch. Yeah. Oh god do I have something to say about it.<br><br>First off. On August 5th, after countless attempts and after getting multiple glitches to work, one man was able to snatch the WR from Logan, getting one for the first time ever. That player is, you probably know him if you've been here for a while… Lawrence! The Glitch main that doesn't even have a completed Non-SC timesheet (me be mad) gets his first WR with a 2:10.809.<br><br>But if you thought that was it for KC Glitch… welp, you're as wrong as if you said that Mogi Lounge was the nicest place on earth. So, so wrong. The track got a total of 12. Twelve. World Records this month. Let me explain how in one word… Logan.<br><br>That dude literally thought it was funny to HIT THE BRAKES ON THE LAST STRAIGHT for every record he set this month, for it to be easier to break. Oof. That's how, in the span of 6 days from the 13th to the 19th, our beloved World Champion got a total of 9 WRs, made fun of everything and everyone, used countless joke Miis, got the community both dying of laughter and unbelieve, and ended with a 2:07.718.<br><br>But I did say that we got 12 WRs on this track, yet Lawrence's and Logan's only add up to 10… Who's the Karter to whom belongs the last 2 WRs then, you ask? Think about it for a minute. Is it not clear? Could someone else than HIM have shut Logan up like he did? Certainly not. This man regains his crown, and crushes his competition…<br><br>The man, Justin, stood up to end Logan's foolishments, setting both a 2:05.892 and a 1:59.751, subbing 2 minutes for the first time on this track! Out of nowhere, he actually hoarded his 2:05 and let Logan do his thing before stepping in. He makes it so we only have 4 tracks with Unrestricted WRs longer than 2 minutes, those being BC, RR, rDS and rBC. Congrats to all 3 of them for having pushed KC this far!<br><br>And that concludes our WR Review for August… Well. At least for course times. You obviously know we on the PP also care about Fastest Laps! So, what Flap WRs did we get this month?<br><br>Take a guess. What track did I talk about a minute ago? Yeah Lawrence, Logan and Justin crushed the KC Glitch Flap from a 30.440 to a 21.356 in just 2 weeks. Expected.<br><br>We did see some Flap activity for the other KC category though, as Luke takes advantage of the new strat to get a 43.726 on August 6th, getting Flap WR here for the first time actually, beating Logan's lap by .188. I'm sure it can go lower, I think we can expect to see a 43.5 being performed at some point here, maybe next year…<br><br>If my calculations are correct, me skipping this part of the update will get me shot with a cannelloni and buried under 500 kilograms of Pizza. Karters and Kartesses, for the first time since 2019 (and June 2008 in Unrestricted!), on the same track again and again… Someone from the Roman Empire of Italy got a Flap WR. And it is no other than… Everyone's favorite long-haired memer JAYU! Now I know why he was begging for the News to come out! He officially becomes the Karter to have set the fastest lap in the History of the game, as his WR was on the shortest category of all, GV Glitch Flap. A 2.872 got on the 18th, only beating Shane by 9 milliseconds is the Italian's first Flap WR. But you know what this makes him as well? It makes him the 2nd new WR holder to NOT HAVE A COMPLETED NON-SC TIMESHEET I swear play those damn flaps or I'm gonna fill them myself with the best split from your 3lap!<br><br>And there you have it, every single WR that happened in August! Some wild ones, some unexpected ones… And you're not ready for what comes in September's Update. We're halfway through the month at the time I'm writing this and it's already the year's best month for Top-level Time Trials. See you in the next News to find out what happened! <br><br>You know I love these, after the WR Review always comes the Monthly Stuff!<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> There may be some debate to it, but to my eyes no country has really made itself shine this month. There was no huge movement on any Country Top, or multiple hype WRs coming from the same place. So I’m gonna go ahead and give this award to a country that we almost don’t see at all in this game but has the chance to have a strong and dedicated Karter on its side. Country of the month is <font color=yellow>South Korea</font>, for the battle Jongwoo is having with Luke for the KC Non-SC crown! It’s “only” a WR but keep in mind that Jongwoo is the only active South Korean player, so if his country had to get a WR it would only be coming from his work. Some countries out there have multiple high-level Karters but fail to have a single WR in their possession… <i>*cough*</i> France and Germany <i>*cough*</i><br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>TRACK OF THE MONTH:</u></font> There was no hesitation this month for this title. As everyone has already guessed, <font color=yellow>Koopa Cape</font> wins it with Jongwoo reclaiming his WR in No-Glitch, but most importantly with all that happened on the Glitch side: Lawrence getting his first WR, Logan farming the shit out of the track and Justin shutting him up with the first sub 2:00, not to mention the Flap improvements on both categories we discussed earlier… If you tell me another track has seen more important development over this month, you’re either trolling or crazy.<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>QUOTES OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=#999999><i>“Arthur I have 3 quote of the month candidates”</i></font> - <font color=yellow>Ben Hurley</font>, August 26th, 2022<br><font color=#999999><i>“can I be a pp updater”</i></font> - the whole public TT Server<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>ANCIENT QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=#999999><i>\"WiiChuck4life, timing wheelies = (y)\"</i></font> - <font color=yellow>Silver</font>, 4th August, 2012<br><br><br><font color=#33EEDD><i>This News Update covers from August 1st to August 31st, 2022</i></font><br><br><br><font color=lime><i>We count 6 new players this month:</i><br><br>AustinMKW (Literally only submitted an LC 3lap)<br>Spodra Ziemele (1st Latvian player to ever register on the site congrats you)<br>Michelle Zoeller (Has a really nice CM Glitch time)<br>Jimmy (Not doing Jimmeys on DKS… yet)<br>Justin JJ Morris (Wario on the ROB-BLS)<br>Carlo Vasciminno (My favorite italian Carlo because he’s good at Moonview)</font><br><br>Before we continue on to the Leaderboard, I'd like to introduce a guest to this News Update...

I think it's fair to call 6 of them mickey mouse frauds. Sad! Not to mention, even after all that, he'd be dethroned by....<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#2</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#2</font>) <font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock</font> THE MAN, THE MYTH, THE LEGEND, Justin still isn't super active with the time trialing, but got probably the craziest time out of nowhere on us: a 1:59 on Koopa goddamn Cape. Turns out, when you're Justin, you can just find stuff that saves a crazy amount of time and just get crazy big records for it. After getting that crazy glitch lap, he decided to drive the two best no glitch laps in a KC glitch record that we have seen. Just Justin things<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#6</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#19</font>) <font color=yellow>Jack Gluesing</font> Jack here got a PB on Parkway glitch flap for a 6.001. I will say, Mr. Prodigy, that Shy Guy Beach flap is right at about a year and a half old now.... hmmmmmmm :eyes:<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#8</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#15</font>) <font color=yellow>Vincent Nguyen</font> Vincent played Dry Dry Ruins and got a pretty cool 1:48.7. Definitely some room to go there, 1:47 in the future, perhaps? <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#10</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#7</font>) <font color=yellow>Bynt.</font> Bynt continued to track hop and be good at everything. The big times here are a 1:21.649 on Shy Guy Beach and a 1:15.728 on Moo Moo Meadows, which are 7th and 9th worldwide respectively. Despite the PBs, Bynt remains at the knockout spot for the top 10 for the players page. Will he survive? We'll just have to wait and see<br><br><br><u><font color=red>Mythical Karters (Top 25)</font></u><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#15</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#6</font>) <font color=yellow>Jay Rangthale</font> Sosis only played one thing, getting a few improvements before landing on a 1:21.447 on Shy Guy Beach. He is still playing, getting some awesome laps and paces. One of them will finish at some point, and this record will be destroyed. Give it time, it will happen. Keep grinding, Sosis<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#18</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#17</font>) <font color=yellow>Dane Allen</font> Thunder improved Peach Gardens to a 2:00.324, a pretty bad time tbh bc it doesn't even beat me. Surely he won't beat me come September. He has also been playing some MC3, and we will get into that next month<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#23</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#23</font>) <font color=yellow>Joeblase</font> Joeblase continues his unretirement, cutting two spots with some solid times, those being a 1:47.999 / 34.993 DKS, and a 44.3 KC flap.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#25</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#3</font>) <font color=yellow>Luke Brown</font> Luke played only a few things, as per usual, but made them count; one of them was a massive flap world record on Koopa Cape, using the new tunnel strat to get a low 43.7, improving the record by almost .2, even being done on lap 1. Later in the month, however, came the biggest revelation: a 1:49.965 on Gold Mine! This one has been in the works for a while, and its super cool to finally see THE sub come to fruition. Way to keep at it, Luke. <br><br><br><u><font color=red>Legendary Karters (Top 50)</font></u><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#26</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#36</font>) <font color=yellow>Phyzothy</font> Phyz dropped some crazy times on us, including a 1:59.8 on BC3, getting that iconic sub 2, a 1:49.6 on DDR, and a 37 on WGM Glitch. However, the biggest kicker this month is the dropping of a 2:04.999 rDS time???????? not sure I saw a 2:04 coming from you, Phyz, but absolute props for making it happen. You're better than you get credit for. <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#27</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#51</font>) <font color=yellow>MKRFirestone</font> Firestone here chopped off three spots by PBing on a solid 12 categories, almost all on those MICKEY MOUSE glitches!!!!! Out of all the times he dropped, though, was a 1:59.980 on rPG. Such a cool sub, congrats on getting that, mate. Great to see such high activity on those other categories, too. Who will reach top 25 first, Phyz or Firestone??? The world will know next month!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#29</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Carter Clem</font> did more of the same, dropping a few random times on us.

He also gained AF!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#42</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#55</font>) <font color=yellow>Shane Hogan</font> Shane played a ton of categories, the coolest of which is giving us all an rWS worldwide top with a glitch time, currently sitting at a 1:44.769. Shane also got a casual .6 PB cut on Moo Moo Meadows to a 1:16.3, and also got a big sub with a 1:31 on rMC.

Nice job Bawp.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#216</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#143</font>) Glitches, MC and Raceway were in the works this month for <font color=yellow>Supreme</font>, as we saw him on CM Unrestricted for a 42.8/6.620, on MC with a nice 1:22.1 Non-SC and 1:13.5 Glitch, and getting his first vid on his timesheet with a sub 1:43 on rMR. Good stuff.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#219</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#150</font>) <font color=yellow>Xenophanes</font> got a few times like rBC 2:33.7, DKS 1:52.8, and an improvement on their Ace Track that is CM Unrestricted, now standing at a 37.8 with a 4.669 Flap. Nice.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#226</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#106</font>) <font color=yellow>Brian Lai</font> improved quite much this News Cycle, to end his comeback well before going back to college. The Virgin lad (get it, because he’s from VIRGINIA lololololol) played mostly rDKJP, getting from a 2:16 to a 2:13.8 completely smashing his previous PR. Other than that he completed a good 1:53.4 on rWS, congrats you beat me by one second and are like 130 placements ahead of me! Anyway, good luck on your classes man<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#228</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Sam Fairless</font> literally only played glitches I already don’t like this… Oh but it’s a 2nd WW CM flap of 4.189 and a WW Tops rSGB 3lap of 1:16.838? Alright fine that’s pretty good. Congrats on those, maybe you could try and push that CM Flap just a bit more though…? I know the category is as wack as ever but there’s only one man to beat…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#249</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#170</font>) <font color=yellow>Evilninja</font> barely enters Top 250 this News Cycle with most notably a 1:18.994 on rMC3 congrats on the sub! On the Red Chart I’d want to point out his 1:59.662 on CM (may be a sub also? If so, nice job) that’s a 3-way tie, some French and German dudes have now been joined by the US that does sound like a very familiar event tho<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#256</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#176</font>) <font color=yellow>Aimee Scaricordi</font> got a four point four four four on CM Flap. Nice digits. Alongside that, some work on her weaker tracks seem to have been made, like BC, rPB or DDR Flap. Get PBs, cut AF, that's how the game works. You should surely hit Top 200 in 2023, it may seem far for now but, speaking from experience, it isn’t really…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#274</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#198</font>) <font color=yellow>ElecTrick</font> got quite a few PRs, like a subbing 1:19.994 on rMC3 (I just noticed it’s exactly one second slower than Evilninja’s PR, quite nice), a breakthrough on BC with a 2:24.8 or a 2:24.7 on KC that PBed by over a second. Highlight though must be that 2-in-1 improvement on GV Non-SC, getting both a 1:56.4 and a 36.9 on the same run, congrats on breaking Top 200 on the Red Charts!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#278</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#184</font>) <font color=yellow>Ryan Lynch</font> cut 3 placements with 4 PRs, the highlight being Moonview without a doubt. It becomes one of his top times with a 1:45.2 and even grants him his 2nd ever Top 100 time on the flap with a 33.4, I love seeing these<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#288</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#177</font>) <font color=yellow>Ragemodepigeon</font> goes deeper into Top 300 this month with 5 PRs and 9 placements gained. What made him jump so well surely is that 2:19.5 on BC Unrestricted coupled with a 44.1 Flap, but he backs it up for Non-SC pretty well too with a 2:24.8/47.0. Pretty good stuff, keep it up bro!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#289</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#200</font>) <font color=yellow>Neemo</font> PBed on LC… with a 1:10.8? His other PBs for the month are… 3 Non-SC Top 100 Flap times on MG, GV and BC? Also, on one end he got a 1:17.7 on MMM… And on the other end a 1:23.5 on MC that’s not even top 600? I think you killed consistency bro<br><br><br><u><font color=red>Karters in the Making (300+)</font></u><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#315</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#202</font>) <font color=yellow>Ivo Bril</font> only submitted a single 1:54.1 on WGM as he couldn’t find time to play this month. Don’t worry man we both have the same problem! The thing to do is to optimize your time doing attempts, like learning a new strat or fixing mistakes, so that you can PB quickly when everything’s set up… I say that but I haven’t had a satisfying PR in months lmao. Anyway, good luck on pushing this track to your limits, I’ll wait to see your Flower Cup filled with vids!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#339</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#195</font>) <font color=yellow>Zevohno</font> went quiet pretty quickly this month only setting 2 PRs in the first 5 days, then nothing. One was a sub 1:01 on rYF, the other was a non-sub 1:54 on WGM No-Glitch. By the way, I see you still have some Intermediate times, it might be interesting to try and get rid of them all? I remember doing that myself back in the day…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#359</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#217</font>) <font color=yellow>Ncsr.</font> isn’t really a match for his former rival Turkey anymore, as he’s now 26 placements ahead… He does have some weaknesses though as we’ve seen this month on rSL, where the Aussie barely subbed 2:09 with a 2:08.968, not even beating the staff ghost when some crazy lads on the Masters Tour do it shroomless while using the ramp 3/3. For his defense we can acknowledge the 2:05.1 he got on rBC3 Unrestricted, that’s a pretty strong time considering he’s only 7ms behind me…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#363</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Greg Finke</font> please tell me that MG No-Glitch was a one-try to fill-in your Red Chart. A 1:51.9 is not acceptable. Thankfully you improved your rMR flap to a 32.1, good job on getting Top 200 by such a margin! …Yeah it’s 200th.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#385</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#224</font>) <font color=yellow>Johnson Turkey</font> is a time traveler! Congrats on the TF 1:54 you got in January 2023! I know I know I’m not funny so well congrats on your actual PRs this month, some great subs like 1:59 DDR or 1:19 rMC3, alongside a GV Non-SC 1:56 that’s really high-ranked compared to his other times, even more than what GV usually gives due to its implementation in the site occuring a few years after the game’s release. I want to know what 2023 is like tho, is Mogi Lounge still toxic? …Rhetorical question of course.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#393</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#218</font>) <font color=yellow>HazzarUK</font> poured out a single PR this News Cycle, being a pretty good 22.030 on LC Flap. Coming from someone with a 1:09.6 3lap though I’m sure you can do better, go get that sub!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#430</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#241</font>) <font color=yellow>princessje11ybean</font> no Six King’s Labyrinth isn’t good at all. However grinding AF is so getting 12 RT PRs and passing 11 people is a good thing! SKL is too old to be a good CT, it’s nowhere near as good as the most recent CTs like Mushroom Peaks for example. That track is amazing.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#459</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#259</font>) <font color=yellow>Chansey</font> beats me on CM glitch… But NOT ON THE FLAP GET FOCUS PUNCHED!!!!

        "content": "<p><b><br>Happy New Year, Karters and Kartesses! I'm glad to be back here as we start 2023 the best way possible… with a News Update! Enough of my talking, you've been waiting long enough to get this…<br><br><br><u><b>So, what happened lately?</b></u><br><br>These last 2 months gave us a bunch of headlines to cover, both inside and outside of our game. The Football World Cup happened that Argentina won, the old former Pope sadly died and a bunch of celebrities like Andrew Tate are being canceled for things that I don't care enough about to mention here. Apparently he got roasted twice by Greta Thumberg for whatever reason, but honestly these things are not very positive or joyful so I'll just pass on that…<br><br>A better News is that everything goes well in our community, at least from what I'm aware of. This end of the year was very quiet, my Masters Tour competition still runs and is approaching its Season 1 Finale smoothly, everyone on the PP is getting PBs here and there but nothing huge, positively or negatively. But speaking of WRs it's true that some of those are definitely worth the talk…<br><br>We've seen 10 new 3lap WRs and 4 Flap WRs on 7 unique tracks this News Cycle. Let's review them.<br><br>Let's pick things up where we last left off, late October. After Justin got his hands on the DKJP Non-SC Top Spot using a new way to make the ending cut, Logan got interested, learned the strat in just a few days to claim his first WR here, subbing 2:11 for the first time with a 2:10.891. However in early November, former holder Luke didn't want to leave the throne uncontested and proved everyone he was the real deal on the track, setting 2 WRs and pulling the category down to a 2:10.645. Respect.<br><br>One step closer to greatness. After the breakthrough he had that led him all the way into the Unrestricted Top 5, Jack Gluesing continues to write his legacy by achieving one of the biggest dreams of every Time Trialer that is setting a World Record. On November 23rd, Jack became the 431st member of the elitist \"WR holders\" group as he set his 1:14.213 on Sherbet Land Unrestricted. And after that on December 21st, as if he was freed from any pressure, he casually dropped a 2-second improvement with a 1:12.225. I tell you this is the start of something big.<br><br>Remember a few months ago when we were saying Justin's KC sub was incredible and would last for many years? Well, some dudes thought it would be fun to completely destroy that WR and make it look like nothing. That's how Lawrence sniped the top spot, beating on November 26th Justin's run by almost .9 with a 1:58.854, and taking the opportunity with it to spread a message that's absolutely wrong because it's called Football and not Soccer. His reign wouldn't last forever though, as a new contender stepped up to claim his 2nd ever WR… He's from Japan, his name is Kei and he looks like he's ready to kick everyone's ass, starting off with Lawrence's by setting a 1:57.900 on December 20th… And he's not on the PP my god why are there almost no Japanese at all on this site they're so good at the game<br><br>We called him the \"MG Prodigy\", Austrian player Alperen got his first WRs a few months ago on the Non-SC category of MG. Did we misjudge him? As Fatality found a new strat on the gap jump, several other Karters tried to replicate it to grab the track's crown, one did, and you know who it is… after all, who could it be other than the one and only, Logan Kebabby? Our Site Champion snatched a 1:40.580 on December 11th, but this 89th WR meant much more for him as he's now the only player to set a WR on 20 different tracks. Logan continues to mark his legacy, as Alperen remains silent and hasn't PBed since his last WR… We'll see how that story goes.<br><br>Make it 7 WRs in a row for Kasey on what now kinda is his track, Peach Beach! The world-class Spear player set a new WR of 1:12.656 on December 14th. He didn't even let his last WR reign for a year and beat it a week before, what a Chad.<br><br>Sometimes, things don't change and just seem right. Sometimes, fate just brings everything together and it just makes sense. Thus, the King gets back on his throne as if he never left. The giant of GV glitch, Niyake, finishes off the year by reclaiming his crown from Jyran with a 15.662 on December 29th! Don't be fooled though, behind this dominance lies years and years of hard work. Even throughout this year, he never stopped the grind and it's been a pleasure to follow the work of this man. The King is back, long live the King!<br><br>Flaps time! A News Cycle where we saw 2 new Flap WR holders in Fatality (MG Non-SC) and Carter Clem (MT Unrestricted). One got it with a 31.145 using his new strat but got sniped a month later by… Logan, of course, who got a 31.087. The other hasn't seen his 23.692 get sniped (yet?) but most importantly, he ended a 10 year-old reign of Demon on the category. Insane. The last Flap WR to review is on KC glitch with a surprising 17.397 from Lawrence, almost a 4 second cut but it's explained by the fact that it doesn't come from a 3lap run but is actually the first actual Flap for the category. Congrats to all!<br><br>What a year this has been… We've equaled 2018 with 122 3lap WRs and continued our streak of now 5 years with 100+ WRs, we said hello to 7 new WR holders in Emil, Mitch, Alperen, Arvo, Lawrence, Jack and Kei but couldn't say goodbye to a handful of WRs and WR holders like Sosis' rSL 2:03.750 or rDH 1:34.397 standing above 1000 days, KingAlex's subbing 1:58.986 on rPG from 2020, Liam's 29.317 Flap on rDH Non-SC that turned into the 3rd longest lasting Flap WR at 2500+ days set in 2016, and obviously Cole's last remaining WR across the whole franchise of 1:08.774 on LC. We discovered so many strategies, from the revolutions of WGM to the new way of taking the ending cut on DKJP, going through the monumental rSGB Glitch discovery, the new shenanigans of KC Glitch or the new rMC Glitch, we watched so many incredible runs being driven, like Caleb's sub 1 on rPG (rPG, really JAYU???? ur fired), Logan's 1:42 on Moonview, Poyo's 1ms improvement to WGM Glitch exactly 13 years after his last WR, Hunter's 2/3 rWS Glitch, Emil's 2:08 on BC Glitch, Darragh's retirement WR on rSGB or Justin's sub 2 on KC Glitch, we saw legacies being written as Logan became the first player to have held a WR on 20 different tracks, as Luke became the first player to surpass 100 career WRs. 2022 was a year filled with Karting. But we must remember who really made this year as intense and active as it was… Not all runs are World Records. 2022 was beautiful because of you, Karters, Kartesses, you who gave the best of yourselves for your timesheet, for your PRs, for the Player's Page, for our brilliant game of Time Trials, on this brilliant game of Mario Kart for the Wii. My friends, I hope 2022 was a great year for you, and I'm sure 2023 will be as good, if not better. Thank you, dear community, for existing and being as full of life as you always are. And I wish that this new year of 2023 holds us the brightest and most incredible gifts. Happy New Year, people of Mario Kart!<br><br>Speaking of all we’ve done in 2022, this time of the year is officially the time of the <font color=#00DD66>Player of the Year</font> (POTY) vote! Who was the most impressive in 2022? That’s what we’ll figure out to give this award to the most deserving Karter of them all. This award will consist of 2 phases: first is the <font color=#33AADD>Nomination Phase</font>, where everyone submits exactly 5 players (not more, not less) who they think could deserve the award, then the 5 Karters collecting the most votes at the end of that phase will face each other in the <font color=#33AADD>Final Poll Phase</font>, where we’ll make a single-answer poll for everyone to decide who wins the biggest award of the year! Everything’s happening on the forum’s threads, so make sure you keep an eye on them! The Nomination Phase starts today!<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> There hasn't been much activity over the past month but for their 2 WRs I'm gonna give the award to <font color=yellow>Japan</font>.

The man that's been blocked at a 1:50.000 for so long had subbed a few months ago and continued even further this News Cycle with a 1:49.425, 13th on the site, paired with a cool 35.819 Flap. Other than that, the Australian improved his BC glitch with a 2:12.464, getting him a Top 100 placement, alongside a few other No-SC tracks that granted him a 49 placement jump and 55 AF cut. That's how the job's done.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#218</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#164</font>) <font color=yellow>Jeroen Schepers</font> got 2 PRs, those being on both KC categories with a 2:23.8 3lap and 45.6 Flap, but still lost AF and went down 4 placements... Well, at least that's what the parser wants you to know, because this News Cycle the man played Non-SC and got like 3 times more PRs with improvements on MT and BC. Special mention to his BC Flap of 46.932 (probably a sub, congrats) that's his 3rd Top 100 time, always feels good to only see 2 digits on that placement!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#228</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#111</font>) <font color=yellow>Brian Lai</font> got… one PB. Hey, that's enough to get onto the News Update when you have a full set of times so I won't complain, plus that's a very cool 36.2 on rWS No-Glitch Flap that's almost top 50 and his best-ranked time when you put aside his Ace Track WGM so it's even better. You're a man of letters btw, why don't you write an essay about your times for the next News Update?

Aside from small improvements to rBC3 nosc flap and rMR flap, the wheeler’s only activity was on Desert Hills, improving his nosc time by almost a full second and making the wall clip shortcut for the first time! …but not being able to improve his 3lap PR lmao. However, he clearly made it on the nice list this year, because he got pbs left, right and center in December! He started by continuing to play flame on non flame tracks, improving his rDKM and rPG flap times, as well as his MH and DC flap times later on in the month. However, he proved that he could, in fact, use the spear, by improving his rPB flap and finally getting the sub 23 he desired. Some smaller improvements to rDS and rBC3 popped up later in the month, but the stand out time was unquestionably on Grumble Volcano, where ElecTrick finally broke through and got his first wheel tops time on a 3lap Non-SC category! Great work once more, ElecTrick! Can’t wait to see what adventures await you in 2023 and thank you for saving my time writing this essay!

I am once again your host today as it is my pleasure to write this essay for you and considering all the bangers we’ve had these past 3 months, I couldn’t resist but to handle the task of this writing, even when I knew it would take much longer than any News Update I’ve done in the past… Truth be told, I actually started writing this update in late February, so it took more than a month for this essay to arrive on this page for y’all to read. I apologize for the delay, I know monthly News are better, but trust me, I will not disappoint!<br><br><u><b>So, what happened lately?</b></u><br><br>After everyone said Happy New Year to each other, we all went back to TTing.

I will not reveal anything in this paragraph. The name of the winner is at the end of the News Update, the entry in the “Awards” page will include the results of the Top 3 and I will post a picture of the full results on the forum soon after the release of this update.<br><br>A little news on my home-made competition, the Masters Tour, as you probably know it’s a series of Time Trial Events with special rules I hold in the public TT server, we’ve officially reached the end of Season 1 and are now playing the Finale of it!

Although I’ve let down the “special ruleset” thing for this part and made all finalists play classic Non-SC tracks, I offer a brand new way of competing in Time Trials in the form of a direct confrontation between players across multiple tracks at once. You can check it out on the public server for more info, the link is in the Resources thread on the Forum!<br><br>Speaking of direct TT competitions, one makes its glorious return right now. In association with Project Sanbo, a brand new CT distribution, Online Time Trials are back, better as ever! And with it, a new season of Online TT Lounge, of course. Get placed in a rank, play Mogis to earn MMR points, and work your way all the way to the top of the charts, at Master rank!<br><br>And although we had a bit of WR activity at the start of January with 4 WRs, nothing happened for almost a full month. Let's review those 4 WRs first, they're not many but they're all bangers.<br><br>He got the first WR of 2022, now he did it again with the first WR of 2023, apparently the greats of GV Glitch only play around the New Year, Jyran gets the record back on January 6th with a stunning 15.497, skipping .5 entirely and that's massive for the shortest category in the game. We'll see if Niyake comes back and battles for the title, Jyran is really pushing both the track and the Japanese master to their limits…<br><br>A shock. A heart attack. A disappointment for some, a relief for others. A page of our game's History was literally THIS close to being turned by one single time. 1:08.774. January 7th. Now not one Karter, but two. Spear Master Kasey TIES Cole's legendary LC WR and creates the first co-reign since Logan and Ross shared the rSL Glitch crown for a day in May 2019 with their 1:37.066. A new WR, yet Cole's run is still standing, as the 2nd longest-lasting current WR, as his last WR, but also as the last WR held by an old-school player who already had WRs back in 2008, 2nd oldest current WR holder as of writing this part being Poyo on WGM Glitch that got his first WR in February 2009. A monument of TTs on the verge of collapsing then, but, as if its fate was to stand for all eternity, he remains unbroken. With the more precise finishing time that CTGP offers, we can even see that Cole’s time still is ahead of Kasey’s. Truly meant to never be broken? The Legend stands his ground… for the moment.<br><br>Another historical WR has been achieved and I can't believe I'm discussing it here with y'all right now. It's a dream. It was supposed to be a dream. It has been a dream for almost 5 years, yet we got to see this fateful run on January 8th, when all the stars aligned, when everything matched, when that last piece of the puzzle that was missing for so long finally showed up. Ladies and Gentlemen. It finally happened. THE 1:44 IS FUCKING REAL AND OF COURSE IT'S BLAKE FUCKING GERMANY THAT GETS THE JOB DONE BRILLANTLY WITH A 1:44.599! YES THIS TIMELINE IS REAL AND IT'S THE ONE YOU'RE LIVING IN RIGHT NOW I know that sounds crazy but it's really not a joke and Blake screamed just like this when he set it (probably). Next step? A 1:43, OBVIOUSLY. Will it take 5 years before we get to watch it unfold? That remains to be seen…<br><br>Phyz's wallet doesn't like this one. He promised 100$ to anybody that could beat Bryce on MG Glitch, well guess what? Bryce got beaten on MG Glitch! On January 8th, Idriz surprised us all with a 20.013, just shy of the holy deca-second sub of 19.xxx. Will he get it? Will Byrce come back and get it? We will see…<br><br>Did I just say we will see? Well guess what happened 4 weeks later on February 4th? …Yeah. Idriz. 19.758. Baby Mario has finally finished all 3 laps of MG in less than 20 seconds! And what better Mii name to use than the one he deserves the most after this milestone… Congrats, MG KING!<br><br>Then we enter the heart of the topic. February and March offered us plenty of WRs for me to review today. Where should I start…<br><br>If I say Peach Gardens, what are you thinking about? Maybe the flowers, the chain chomps, the moles, the maze, or the fact that this track has a unique WR that uses Spear Auto…. Sorry, I meant HAD a unique WR that has just been replaced on February 5th by a boring Flame Runner time of 1:58.980 by Kasey, leaving the great KingAlex with no WRs in the process… And all of this thanks to a new strat in the hedge maze. Talk about killing originality… but you know what’s worse? He almost beat the PAUSE BUFFERED WR by Carter a few weeks later with a 1:58.940 on March 11th, just one single millisecond away from Carter’s time. You’re not telling me that this Pause Buffered category will lose its legitimacy as a category just a few weeks after being added to mkwrs.com’s main page?<br><br>Logan got a 1:49.074 on TF Non-SC on February 5th. That’s it, that’s the paragraph.<br><br>…Oh, and I almost forgot he also got the rMC Glitch on February 17th, but this time, finally, he was able to finish a 3lap run with it that beats the Non-SC WR, ending at a 1:30.224, now y’all have a good reason to mark rMC as Non-SC in your submissions!<br><br>Imagine you’re the best in the world at something, then you kinda lose interest in it, people start beating you, and all your records, although part of History, are now gone and replaced by other people’s times. But one day, the flame that once burnt in your soul for this something, that was gone for so long, reappears, and fills you with determination to renew with your past ways and show everyone you’re still worthy and that your story isn’t just a closed book with an ending. This is the story of the greatest Norwegian to ever play the game. Former World #1 Martin Fox thus got his first WR in almost 5 years on BC Shortcut with a time of 2:08.813! 61st career WR for Fox, but surely felt as good as the first one. We all hope this is the start of a new chapter of TTs for you, legend! We’ll see if you can take your newly-regained WR back tho, as Emil stepped-up again to reclaim it on March 5th with a 2:08.697. A battle in the castle between the old and the new generation maybe?<br><br>So, if you noticed the title of this News Update, by now you’re probably wondering why the hell is it called “Justin appreciation post”. Well, let me just say ALL of February was the Justin appreciation post. But why exactly? One thing to remember: it’s Justin. If you’ve followed our game for long enough, you probably know who he is and what he’s used to doing in terms of WRs and such. You probably guessed it… Justin did what Justin always does, he found a new strat. And what a strat. Especially that it’s on Rainbow Road.<br><br>Man just discovered a way to make the glitch using fucking Shooting Star! Outside-drifting bikes now hold 2 WRs in the game, probably a first since 2008. The method looks relatively simple: you start, you turn around, you drift and hit the fence, and fly all the way to the end of the track, similar to what we’ve seen with the Quacker but using a clip instead of a bounce. And the Shooting Star being one of the better vehicles to use on the track after Flame Flyer and Flame Runner… Obviously it’s faster than the old method, and by a landslide. Karters rushed on their consoles to be the first to pull off this technique, and the first one to do so was Hunter that got a 2:07.166 with it, beating Logan’s previous WR by almost 3 seconds on February 8th. Later that day, Core would lower it down to a 2:05.498 then a 2:04.554 using Ultra_Pear’s crush uh I mean Rosalina, and get 2 more WRs 2 days later, finishing at a 2:03.728. The sub was on the horizon… But remember who discovered the thing. Yeah. You get it.<br><br>Justin blows everyone up, beats Core by 4 seconds and gets the sub 2 on February 12th with a whopping 1:59.606! Just like he did on Koopa Cape. This is his game and he’s playing with us. Not to mention, he also got 2 other WRs after that, going down to a 1:56.824 set on the 13th. This one stood for a while, before the grind and perseverance of a certain Norwegian, mainly known for his 5th WW status on Yoshi Falls, finally paid off as he managed to beat Justin’s time with a 1:56.788 on March 13th. If you follow the TT scene sharply you should have guessed it by now, Exploder is our first new WR holder of 2023! He even managed to top this time 6 days later with a 1:56.690, where the record currently stands as of April 1st, 2023… All of these times are 1/3s though, and even if it’s pretty unlikely, a 2/3 run is possible, given that a 1-shroom glitch has already been done several times. It shouldn’t be crazy difficult to pull it off alongside a 2-shroomer to do the glitch twice in a run… On paper. In reality, with the nerves and all, it’s pretty damn difficult. A few players are trying to make it though, first one being Exploder, and if my sources are correct, World #1 Logan. We’ll see how that thing goes in the future.<br><br>On the other side of RR though, we did see one new WR. Even with the glitch now using an outside drifting bike, let’s not forget that the real unique category here is Non-SC. Flare thus improved his own WR with a stunning 2:24.281, skipping .3 entirely and inching closer and closer to the holy sub 2:24… Which the best splits don’t give yet but they at least give something that’s very close. I do believe we will see a 2:23 being performed here one day, but as of the time it will take until someone gets it, I have no idea…<br><br>Do you think Luke is the GOAT of WGM Non-SC? You might, but ACKSHHUALY someone objects to this statement, and who could that someone be other than that one guy that’s topping all charts, Logan Kebabby himself. He becomes the 2nd person to pull off a 1:49 on the track and snatches yet another one of Luke’s records with a 1:49.934 also on March 5th, getting to 13 WRs held at once. But wait, there’s more…<br><br>He got the glitch back as well lmao, getting to 14 WRs held at once (all-time record) by beating Poyo with a 31.756 on March 15th. Where will this man stop? Probably not now considering he’s only 7 WRs away from becoming the 2nd Karter in History to ever get 100 total career WRs…<br><br>Omega almost changed his name to Zeke apparently! The BC GOAT returned on March 11th to improve his record by exactly 98 milliseconds… I’ll let you calculate the finishing time real quick… Yeah it’s not the 2:19. It’s a 2:20.001. On the bright side, we’re almost guaranteed to see a 2:19 next time there’s an improvement on the category. On the other hand, it’s a .001, how bitter of a taste this must’ve been for the Japanese player… But I’m sure he’ll recover from that and surpass himself to get the 2:19. I mean, similar to Blake’s 1:43 on DKS, he’s had the level to smash this sub for years and he could almost get a low 2:19 as a subbing run, so I’m sure it’s not a simple close attempt that will slow him down. If someone has to do it, as of now, it has to be him. May fortune find the Karters who dare defy their limits as we say!<br><br>A shocker! I never thought we would see Sosis' 1:34.397 on rDH Non-SC being beaten anytime soon, yet against all odds, it happened and who else would it be to take the crown than the one top player we don't talk about very often, Vincent Braixen. Man gets a WR on the Non-SC category of Desert Hills for the 1st time by beating Sosis' 1100+ days old run by a single frame, with a 1:34.381 set on March 27th. It's always a huge thing to beat an old record, let alone a 3 year-old one, so congrats to Braixen for that!<br><br>It's been a while since we heard of him, and so he returns! I was about to say he was on a WR drought since his last one was in November but Luke returns to his ways by setting 2 WRs back to back late March, one on KC and one on DKJP, both Non-SC as you'd expect from him. He thus improves his own records, first on the 29th on KC by close to .1, inching closer to the 2:16 with a 2:17.219, then on the 31st on DKJP by 73ms with a 2:10.572. He thus extends his streak of Years with at least one WR by 1, being at 7 years in a row since 2017, only beaten by Braixen who, with his new rDH time, now has set a WR each year since 2016. Consistency.<br><br>Our final stop for this Update’s WR review is KC, on the glitch side though because it got improved twice. Kei improved his own WR by a tiny 21ms on March 12th to a 1:57.879, and now that’s when you know you’re on a glitch category because Revengestyle6 aka Lawrence reclaimed his WR, smashing Kei’s time by 1.4 seconds with a 1:56.471. I feel like this category still has a very long way to go, we’ll see where these guys take it.<br><br>One thing I want to note before closing out the WR review though is, if Justin wasn’t there, who knows if we would've been able to find all of the strats he discovered on our own… From KC all the way to RR Glitch, including the WGM Non-SC ending, these strats aren’t even everything he implemented. And if we count the TASes he’s made then… Oh by the way he recently found a way to make the rPG Glitch 3lap viable for TAS with the FUCKING PHANTHOM. Where will he stop…<br><br>Speaking of TAS, we got to see another pretty huge discovery on February 27th, from Ejay. To put it lightly and shortly, man just casually dropped a 17 second lap on MMM, breaking the track and discovering what could possibly be the last Ultra Shortcut ever on 150cc. A few days later, Jellopuff would improve it using an actual flap setup to a 9.207, breaking the 10-second barrier. It’s crazy how TAS can accomplish things you wouldn’t even dare to think about, and it’s all the beauty of it…<br><br>And that’s basically it for 3lap and TAS WRs this month, we thus got 30 3lap WRs in these first 3 months of 2023, a rather good start compared to recent years (25 WRs in 2020, finished at 102 and 29 WRs in 2021, finished at 101) but still not the best start we’ve had (36 WRs in 2022, finished at 122 and 40 WRs in 2019, finished at 149). We will see where the future months take us! But before that and to wrap up this intro, let’s take a look at the 10 Flap WRs we’ve had so far in 2023…<br><br>Oh wait, they’re almost all on RR Glitch lmfao. 2 are from Kei and Lawrence on KC glitch, a 16.917 and a 16.262 respectively, then the rest is on the newly-changed category. From Hunter to Core twice to Justin, we then got Italian Carlo that had the record for 3 weeks, then Enzo claimed it but got sweeped the same day by Justin again, and now it’s in the hands of Mystogan since February 21st with a 15.066. Surprisingly, no other Flap was broken these 2 months, although we did see Justin and Braixen set a 2nd WW time, on rSL and rDH, both Non-SC, respectively. And when Justin’s rSL went completely under the radar (except for me because he kicked me out of WW tops why would you do that!), everyone was pretty hyped about Braixen’s one because we could potentially see the oldest Flap WR, Liam’s 29.317 from 2016, being beaten soon, now that it turned 7 years old on January 30th. It’s been standing for almost 2600 days and is Liam’s last standing WR. As always, we’ll see how that goes.<br><br>With all of this out of the way let's dive into my favorite part of the News, you know it by now <br><br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> Although UK could’ve earned it with the whopping 4 WRs by Core on RR using best waif- I mean character in the game Rosalina, <font color=yellow>Norway</font> takes it home for the 1st time with Fox’s WR and Exploder’s work on the space track.

He probably tried the recently discovered rPG Flame Runner strats as the man with the most WRs ever got a 1:59.3 that's current 7th WW. What surprised me until March is that he hadn't gotten a WR for over 4 months, last one being early November on DKJP… However he supposedly heard my thinking, as UK's star player bounced back and started winning again with the 2 new WRs on KC and DKJP I talked about in the WR review.

He also has some competition with “Quacker”!)<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#31</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#26</font>) <font color=yellow>Kevin Miller</font> got quite the PRs to push himself very close to Top 30 with a 10.8 AF cut, highlights being a God Standard of 33.2 on DDR Flap, the infamous 2:04 on rSL and a fast 2:11.8 on BC Shortcut, nice job for someone that “relies on flaps” lol<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#36</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#86</font>) <font color=yellow>Ryley Carroll</font> the good old H2O man improved on his strongest categories of MMM (1:16.3) but most importantly DKS with a stunning 1:47.753 that’s 12th on the PP, only but a few milliseconds short of the holy Regional Top being a 1:47.708 by WillCU. Good luck if you want to finish the job here Hydr8ion!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#39</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#55</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> only played flaps, maybe it’s Arrow and not Chaos that relies on them after all! The rPB Glitch Flap WR Holder (what a status) almost got the 21.8 on LC Flap with a 21.902 and poured out a God Time of 3.369 on GV Glitch Flap, why isn’t Jayu writing this I’m sure he’s so proud of you<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#46</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Lawrence</font> I hate writing this N/A for the Non-SC placement but I guess there’s no way you’re playing these categories so I’ll just accept it… Haha you thought go play the best category in the game that’s BC3 Non-SC Flap and I’ll forgive you! You already finished everything on Glitch, as told by your recent WW-Tops-earning Sub 50 on MC, so go have some fresh air and play something else without shortcuts for once… And no that 59.8 on rYF doesn’t count that’s not even a track that’s a lottery<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#47</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#91</font>) <font color=yellow>Hunter Wells</font> Got a WR this News Cycle although it kinda stayed as such for less time than it took for Germany to invade France in 1940. He only played RR Glitch, and lowered his time from his 2:07.1 WR to a 2:00.8 / 15.8, 7th WW / 7th American respectively as of writing this part. He can thus thank Justin for his 0.5 AF cut that allows him to stay in Top 50 at least for another News Cycle. Great job nonetheless Hunter!<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Royal Karters (Top 100)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#53</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#82</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Loerzel</font> the DKJP King (get it, because it says “Royal” Karters… now laugh) loses a placement on both charts although he played 3 tracks, those being TF, rYF, and LC. That last one was for the Masters Tour Finale and he improved to a 1:09.426, that's one solid time… Also I notice the flap on TF uses the glitch btw nice job making it, and a 59.6 on rYF is really cool to have if you ask me considering how ridiculously annoying that fucking nightmare of a track can be. So congrats on your improvements! A bit sad that you got eliminated from the Masters Tour though, but it happens, you'll do better next time for sure<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#54</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#87</font>) <font color=yellow>JAYOO</font> this autistic bozo only played glitches so I won’t review any time of his that’s what you get for not playing the Chad categories!!!! Oh wait is that a 28.9 DC Flap I see in the distance omg it’s No-Glitch finally but still loses to me by a mile hehe get better bro :) I could maybe acknowledge that a 2:03/15.5 RR Glitch is cool, and these 1:34.1/27.8 rDH Glitch times are placed quite high… But is it really worth it if you really think about it, we all already know you’ve been cracked at glitches for a while now<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#55</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#62</font>) <font color=yellow>Danny Boy</font> gets a 1:49.669 on DKS that’s very cool and probably the highlight of his January, that would’ve been highlight of the News Cycle if it weren’t, obviously, for the RR Glitch again, where he got a 2:02/15.7. A good job that cuts 5 placements on the charts, and yes I completely went over his 2:06.6 KC Glitch improvement but he had made the glitch before already so it’s not a huge deal as he’s still 6th WW there (also I kinda don’t care about the category ngl 8 people have made the glitch in 2 years)<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#60</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#57</font>) <font color=yellow>Claus</font> works on his KC and gets the GOD standard on the flap with a 44.4, really cool although I admit I have better-placed flaps than this one and they’re like Legend A or something (the PP hates me, we gotta make new standards tho), plus a 2:20.3 on the 3lap is a great time to have as well, GL if you want to push for that lovely 2:19 man<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#62</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#72</font>) <font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs</font> cuts… 104 placements. Yes you read that right. This is what playing flaps gets you, Karters and Kartesses… And yeah it’s probably also updating all your times at once with the same date although they’re like 3 months old but I don’t care because it’s all flaps and they’re relevant! On top of all of these the Australian prodigy also gets a very respectable time on rSL, a 2:04.4, 2nd Oceania that could be on American Tops, along with a 39.8 flap that’s literally WW Tops GGs man you won the track<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#64</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#68</font>) <font color=yellow>Ultra_Pear</font> only gets 4 PRs for this News Update cuts 2 AF yet some guys climbed so many placements that he ended up losing a spot, even though these were 2 of those PRs were on his weaker tracks: rMR and TF. He got a nice improvement on the latter one for a 1:51.3 (beats me) but Raceway still eludes him as he only gets a 1:43.4, one of his only 4 categories ranked outside of Top 250 here. Sometimes you do things wrong and you don’t know why at all, trust me I’ve been there multiple times on several tracks… God I hate Waluigi Stadium<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#66</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#149</font>) <font color=yellow>Intel Core</font> hasn’t only gotten 4 WRs on RR Glitch this News Cycle, in fact the 2:01.9 on rDKM Shortcut I’m seeing is very strong and just like Danny he played KC Glitch to improve his time there to a 2:04.7. A very good month, although it would be nice to see you focus on the No-Glitch part of your timesheet, it’s weird to see all of these top glitch times all on WW Tops and just under it there’s a 1:43.9 on Raceway that’s barely Top 400 PP…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#72</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#60</font>) <font color=yellow>Michele Gallastri</font> gets a time of 1:50.352 on TF! …Hold on.

Highlight of the News here is that he got the Glitch on Parkway with a 1:54.7 and 23.2 flap, it’s not an extraordinary Glitch time but I can’t imagine how much AF that made you cut… Oh and btw I completely forgot about it but sadly no one in the staff team has heard of that Lynn Mullis you were searching for<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#109</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#93</font>) <font color=yellow>Chloie</font> oh hey you weren’t even in Top 150 last time we saw you there what the hell happened, by looking at your timesheet it seems you just felt like improving half of it at the same time so congrats on doing so and cutting more AF than I could ever think of cutting today (46 AF), btw that 2:28 on RR looks dope on your timesheet <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#121</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#73</font>) <font color=yellow>2ndmatt</font> just kicked my ass in the Masters Tour pools thanks you’re welcome but man also updated his timesheet to have all his current PRs as well and, what can I say?

It’s the best out of the 4 though as it’s a 1:51.5 on TF, pretty good for his standards. Keep it up, slowly but surely!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#226</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#182</font>) <font color=yellow>Peyton Gunn</font> makes a good move this News Cycle with a 37 AF cut and 24 PRs such as 36.9 CM Glitch, 2:06.3 rSL No-Glitch or 2:08.3 rDKM Shortcut, I can see you’re making progress and are getting better and better at the game so continue on this momentum!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#227</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#119</font>) <font color=yellow>Pabloski</font> has had improvements on many 3laps during the only month he played, January, with times on DC (1:30.4), rYF (59.9), rDS (2:06.4) or rBC (2:32.5), and most notably KC where he got a 2:20.8 that’s his best ranked time on all of his Combined timesheet at 67th and still very good for his Non-SC charts. If only you played flaps a bit more seriously…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#228</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#138</font>) <font color=yellow>Luca R</font> has a very contrasted timesheet as you can see a 2:22.001 on MT Non-SC then a few lines above a… 1:50.2 on TF okay I don’t even have that on my timesheet, not to mention a crazy 2:17.4 on BC3, Non-SC! I sense potential but I also sense laziness or lack of interest for other tracks because if you can get these times on these tracks then you certainly can get similar times on other tracks, so get to work and you’ll climb the ranks faster than I’m writing this News Update… Oh wait no I didn’t mean you’ll take forever<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#231</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#114</font>) <font color=yellow>Brian Lai</font> got one PB on January 1st then vanished in college.

I would still be ahead if my nunchuck didn’t feel the urge to act French and go on strike for the last geyser trick!!

From what’s fresh and new on this timesheet I note a 2:14.3 on Parkway that’s pretty solid and a probably-subbing 2:29.6 on RR nice job on the big sub! I’d love to get that sub myself but the track has been giving me a middle finger for 2 years now<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#241</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#180</font>) <font color=yellow>Zyxis</font> cuts 25 AF and 22 placements to enter Top 250 for the first time! The main source of this cut is probably that 2:01.2 / 38.7 on BC3 Shortcut, both are almost Top 100 times so it’s pretty cool to have that when you’re in that part of the leaderboard…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#254</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#148</font>) <font color=yellow>Jesse Jay</font> gets 25 PRs to boost her from outside of Top 300 to barely not Top 250, a 54 placement jump that’s huge! Some of these times really shine on your timesheet, like this 1:53.000 / 36.1 on WGM (RIP sub), that 1:22.4 on MC or even the little 33.988 DDR Flap that’s Top 100.

Okay maybe he did but it’s forgiven with that insane 36.065 on GV Non-SC Flap that’s Top 20 on the PP, his best time by far and his first European Flap Tops you love to see it! It even came with a decent 1:54.7 3lap so what else could we possibly ask for… maybe a double PB on GV2 of 53.6 / 16.6, double Legend standard? Yeah that seems reasonnable<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#278</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#199</font>) <font color=yellow>Dylan Lepeirtz</font> finishes his timesheet and enters the AF charts!

Congrats, your work finally paid off! Continuing his journey through all tracks in order, he’s been done with the Star Cup this News Cycle, where he just got his first ever No-Glitch Top 100 time with a 36.7 Flap on GV. The first of many, I hope! He then logically started the Special cup with PRs on DDR and MH, which granted him the AF cut he needed for the Top 300. All I can say is, onwards! You still have half of the tracks to play, I wonder where you'll place once you'll be done…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#299</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#209</font>) <font color=yellow>Silicosis</font> finishes his timesheet, have a good time cutting AF! I would’ve sworn I already wrote something for you here but apparently not, I probably take too long between updates to remember what I said in the last one lmao<br><br><br><font color=red><u>Karters in the Making (300+)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#303</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#224</font>) <font color=yellow>Graden</font> falls back under Top 300 due to only setting one PR since the New Year, what slacking does to your AF…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#313</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#210</font>) <font color=yellow>Loocs</font> gets back to the game for the first time in almost a year after posting his entire timesheet in April last year, with 2 new records on LC and DKS, the better one by far being DKS with a 1:53 that’s quite good for someone that hasn’t played in a year tbh<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#318</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#232</font>) <font color=yellow>Will Fury</font> gets a few PRs to cut a bit of AF and climb 3 placements, I have to highlight the GV2 No-Glitch here because seeing a 16.6, Top 100 Flap on here is really rare, so congrats on that!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#330</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#221</font>) <font color=yellow>Ncsr.</font> has definitely abandoned the “half retired” status because he set 23 PBs this News Cycle to pass 14 people. One thing catches my attention though, his newly-set rDS time is 666th on the site… No way this comeback was caused by some evil spirit, right??<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#347</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#218</font>) <font color=yellow>Momo Y.F</font> set a single PB so far in 2023, a 1:30.8 on DC. Not bad, I know some people higher on the charts that have a worse time than that…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#353</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#212</font>) <font color=yellow>Zevohno</font> gets the exact same start for 2023, a single PB but a good one, this time on MT with a 2:19.9. Again I know quite a few people ranked higher here that lose to this time… <i>*cough*me*cough*</i><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#356</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#203</font>) <font color=yellow>Pablo Hernangómez</font> what are these PBs doing here? A 1:51.2 on WGM, 28.4 on DC Flap, 53.3 on GV2 and 1:31.8 on rMC, yet you’re not even Top 350? I lose to all of those. Please improve on the other tracks so you can have a ranking that suits your level thank you<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#388</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#269</font>) <font color=yellow>Emil Lönquist</font> installed himself further in Top 400 by cutting 12 placements with 14 PRs, almost all in Non-SC in which he struggles a bit more compared to glitches. Good driving comes with practice, so keep it up!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#395</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Ryan Billingham</font> how have you been since New Year? …Oh wait that’s New Year but 2013. Even with 10 years of inactivity people really don’t quit this game. He comes back with a time of… 1:35.7 on rDH Non-SC OKAY that contrasts with your timesheet so much but considering you hit a 1:09.7 on LC in 2009 I guess it was to expect. I’ll say, what a way of getting your first PR of the 2020s…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#402</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#242</font>) <font color=yellow>Princessje11ybean</font> improves on MG Glitch for the millionth time and also gets some other PRs to contend for a Top 400 placement by the next News Update. LC is not “super shit” by the way, just learn how to play with the Spear and it’ll actually be a good track that only gets infuriating once you’re at a level where wheelie cuts matter<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#406</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#245</font>) <font color=yellow>.VDix</font> apparently wanted to have a french “Ten” in his name, probably because he’s a 10/10 or \"Dix sur Dix\" as I say as a baguette man. I can’t really judge his times since they’re on Kart and 95% of all times here are with Bikes but I do note the improvement on RR No-Glitch Flap to a 48.0, 15th PP and barely not God standard, that’s the only spotlight Kart mains get here so I’ll work with that<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#429</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#277</font>) <font color=yellow>Leila FalB Massanova</font> got many PRs to cut 38 AF and 24 spots, the highlight of which being making the glitch on rDKM to get a 2:11.5 / 41.5, the Flap being one of the few categories she got Top 200 on. But I can’t go over a timesheet without looking at the Non-SC times and tbh that 1:53 on TF is pretty nice for your standards, good job on that one<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#440</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#266</font>) <font color=yellow>Chansey</font> cuts exactly 10 spots after a peak of activity, 21 PRs that’s not quite what I would call stall but I’ve seen similar non-stall builds of you before so I’m not surprised and definitely not complaining. As always you’re super effective on Glitch categories with great times on CM Flap or both GV categories, but you’ve been hard at work with your 4x weakness that’s Non-SC and I appreciate that, now go finish your training for today and I’ll give you an oran berry<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#511</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Russell Horwood</font> is another one of these come-back men, last seen in August 2018 but comes back with a single PR! This time it’s on rSGB Non-SC (bet you didn’t know Glitch was a thing here) Flap with a 27.0, nothing too special but it’s better than nothing as we say<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#516</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#276</font>) <font color=yellow>Snape Skin</font> comes back to the game after a full year to submit 2 PRs he got in January on both rYF categories, a 1:01.6 / 18.9. Pretty weird to choose this track of all tracks to return to the game but I respect your choices… Nevermind I can’t rYF is too much of a nightmare for me<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#533</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#280</font>) <font color=yellow>Ashley Taylor</font> gets 8 PRs and cuts 15 placements, but what’s most important is that his rMR 3lap is exactly 1000th, how cool is that? Well it’s not cool for AF and it’s not even a time he got this News Cycle but still<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#556</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#285</font>) <font color=yellow>Ruben Cauchon</font> is a timesheeter for this News Cycle, welcome on the rankings!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#677</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#329</font>) <font color=yellow>Lowercase</font> you have to appreciate the fact that the man himself actually played well this News Cycle. He focused on his favorite track BC and improved to as low as a 2:25.1 (!!) with a 48.0 (!!!) Flap, both being his best ranked times by far. And all of this is technically due to… me, partially, with the January Event of the Masters Tour being on BC. Still, it’s his work, his passion and his skills that led to this time, so I want everyone out here to type “congrats Lowercase” in every #general of every MK server he’s in. As for me I’ll just do it here, congrats on the time Lowercase!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#731</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#377</font>) <font color=yellow>Justin JJ Morris</font> gets 12 PRs to cut little AF but that’s so hard in this part of the leaderboard that it’s worth mentioning it. I still see a few Newbie standard times on your timesheet, I’d recommend you to try and improve these first since they’ll logically be your main source of AF cuts, and also because it’s a bit rough to see Newbie standard times on a timesheet tbh<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#756</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Bobby Yu</font> is our last active player for this update, fun fact I’m writing the leaderboard last so that means I’m finished, I’m writing this on a Google Doc with Verdana font size 15 and the document is fucking 44 pages long my hands hurt. But let’s speak of Bobby because it’s actually his part in case you forgot, man improved his rBC and subbed 1 minute congrats on getting this milestone! …I probably got some people there because I meant on Flap. It’s always good to see your Flap timesheet complete with times of under a minute…<br><br><br><br>And there you have it, that's all the activity for the first 3 months of 2023! A good start, that shows our game still lives brightly even almost 15 years after its release… That will be this month in April by the way. The future of this game is in good hands, I'm sure of it.<br><br>That's all for me, this News was tough to make to be honest, but I'm satisfied with the result and I hope you enjoyed it too! As always, have a wonderful day, thanks for reading, and see you later, Karters and Kartesses! Happy Karting!<br><br><br><font color=#FF5555><u>Take a closer look at this month’s Site Records:</u></font><br><br><font color=yellow>Idriz </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mushroom Gorge crs</font> time of 0'20\"036 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'19\"758</font><br><font color=yellow>Keita </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 0'47\"715 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'47\"583</font><br><font color=yellow>Blake Germany </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DK's Snowboard Cross crs</font> time of 1'45\"210 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'44\"599</font><br><font color=yellow>LOGAN KEBABBY </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 0'31\"850 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'31\"756</font><br><font color=yellow>Lawrence </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> time of 1'58\"854 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'56\"471</font><br><font color=yellow>Lawrence </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape lap</font> time of 0'17\"397 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'16\"262</font><br><font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 0'15\"673 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'15\"497</font><br><font color=yellow>Emil Parappuram </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'08\"951 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'08\"697</font><br><font color=yellow>Exploder </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road crs</font> time of 2'10\"051 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'56\"690</font><br><font color=yellow>Mystogan </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Rainbow Road lap</font> time of 0'21\"017 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'15\"066</font><br><font color=yellow>LOGAN KEBABBY </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Mario Circuit crs</font> time of 1'30\"272 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'30\"224</font><br><br><font color=#FF5555><u>No-Glitch:</u></font><br><br><font color=yellow>LOGAN KEBABBY </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Toad's Factory crs</font> time of 1'49\"156 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"074</font><br><font color=yellow>LOGAN KEBABBY </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Wario's Gold Mine crs</font> time of 1'49\"965 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'49\"934</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Koopa Cape crs</font> time of 2'17\"304 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'17\"219</font><br><font color=yellow>LOGAN KEBABBY </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Grumble Volcano crs</font> time of 1'51\"309 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'51\"289</font><br><font color=yellow>Shawn Berry </font>beat the old <font color=orange>Bowser's Castle crs</font> time of 2'20\"359 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'20\"265</font><br><font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock </font>beat the old <font color=orange>GCN Peach Beach lap</font> time of 0'22\"369 with a time of: <font color=magenta>0'22\"360</font><br><font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen </font>beat the old <font color=orange>DS Desert Hills crs</font> time of 1'34\"397 with a time of: <font color=magenta>1'34\"381</font><br><font color=yellow>Luke Brown </font>beat the old <font color=orange>N64 DK's Jungle Parkway crs</font> time of 2'10\"645 with a time of: <font color=magenta>2'10\"572</font><br><br><br><font color=green><u>PLAYER AWARDS:</u></font><br><br><font color=#00DD66><u>Player of the Week:</u></font><br><br> - January 1: <font color=yellow>Blake Germany</font><br><br> - January 2: <font color=yellow>Arvo Koskikallio</font><br><br> - January 3: <font color=yellow>Falco</font><br><br> - January 4: <font color=yellow>Idriz</font><br><br> - February 1: <font color=yellow>Intel Core</font><br><br> - February 2: <font color=yellow>Martin Fox</font><br><br> - February 3: <font color=yellow>Logan KEBABBY</font><br><br> - February 4: <font color=yellow>Sergio</font><br><br> - March 1: <font color=yellow>Emil Parappuram</font><br><br> - March 2: <font color=yellow>Exploder</font><br><br> - March 3: <font color=yellow>Zed R</font><br><br> - March 4: <font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen</font><br><br><font color=#00DD66><u>Player of the Month:</u></font><br><br> - January: <font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs</font><br><br> - February: <font color=yellow>MKRFirestone</font><br><br> - March: <font color=yellow>Mitchell Healy</font><br><br><font color=#00DD66><u>Player of the Quarter (January-March):</u></font> <font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock</font><br><br><font color=#00DD66><u>Player of the Year:</u></font> <font color=yellow>Jack Gluesing</font><br><br><br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>MEME OF THE MONTH:</u></font><br><br><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RdHTt0o.png\" width=\"440\" height=\"369\"><br><br>- Arthur'Oww, that one Moonview-obsessed frenchie</b><br></p>",

        "content": "<p><b>Posted by Ultra_Pear, written by Ben H. All praise, complaints, and lawsuits must be directed in the direction of Ben H, Ultra_Pear has done nothing to prove he is worthy of your praise, complaints, or lawsuits in this news update. (This paragraph was written by Ben Hurley gang)<br><br>Sup dickheads and dickfeet (or whatever tf Arthur calls y’all), it’s everyone’s favorite Ben (the Hurley kind, not the Brophy kind), and I’ll be taking care of this here news update. A lot happened this month in terms of the time trial scene. We’ve seen a three-peat of months this year with 13+ records each, something that hasn’t been done since 2012. However, I’d like to start off this news by dedicating it to two special players that have been at the top of their games for a long time, two we call “Legend”, <font color=yellow>Nick Meade</font> and <font color=yellow>Caleb House</font>.<br><br>Nick achieved a goal everyone in the community has been rooting for him to get for ten years, the legendary 2:30 on rBC no glitch. He announced his achievement in a twitter post where he said “I am gonna drink water so mf hard rn.” followed by a lone screenshot of Funky Kong on lap 4, and a time that read “2:30.998”. For the last several years, Nick has cheered for us on our time trial journey’s, picking us up when we fell down, and being one of the most positive people this community will ever see, even though he has only seen a handful of pbs on his own. This time, Nick, we, the time trial community, cheered for you, and we are so proud of you for your perseverance, and for setting an example that no matter how long you’ve played the game, old dogs can still do tricks that they could’ve done 10 years ago if they had just not quit the game. That’s how the saying goes, right?<br><br>And of course, our friend RAF Guy, aka Caleb House, announced his retirement after dominating the game for nearly a decade. Two years ago, in April of 2021, Caleb destroyed Mario Circuit no glitch with a time of 1:20.357, which absolutely shook the community. It inspired me to get a 1:22 that day, which took me approximately 3 hours because I was refusing to just simply do 1-0-2 to avoid the chain chomp lap 3 (I eventually caved). He also set potentially the final sub 1:00 time this game will ever see (come on RR…) on rPB last September. I’d love to go through all of the history Caleb set, but we’d be here till the day he pulls the “I’m back.” card out. This past month, he decided he wanted to spend more time with God, among other things (even though he's literally right next to you when you’re playing), and call it a career. Caleb, you’ve reminded us that we all grow out of mario kart eventually, no matter how good we are, and we wish you the best of luck in your life journey.<br><br><br><u><b>And now onto the shit you expected</b></u><br><br>The master’s tour (Arthur bang ding ‘Oww’s discord competition) will not be covered, as I do not give a single flying or walking fuck as to what happens. I will say that Shane dropped out (he’d rather play minecraft, what a fucking weirdo) which led to Bickbork getting a spot in the finals. I don’t wish luck to anyone in this competition.<br><br>Project Sanbo has continued to run and they are still having problems… it’s almost as if the channel just came out. This is something I do care about, and I encourage all time trailers to give online TT lounge a shot, it’s such a fun gamemode that deserves so much more activity than it gets. The more activity we see, the better the experience will be made for everyone. I didn’t get to play as much last month, but activity is on the rise, and if OTT can keep an active community I think the amount of OTT competitions and prizes for winning those competitions will only become more frequent, and bigger. Please, Troy, do ONE online TT knockout, bring Nick along, give us the publicity we deserve.<br><br>Also two brand new ultras were discovered, more on that later.<br><br>Now, the moment you’ve all been waiting for, the World Records. Sponsored by your mother. (yes, you, the person reading this, your mother sponsored my news update, go ask her she’ll tell you yes)<br><br>We start our journey through the month of April with activity on Rainbow Road (Glitch). Nara set his first world record with a time of 1:56.681, a record by 0.009. Massively well deserved but, Nara, dude, it’s a glitch not called GV or CM, maybe next time don’t fuck up the halfpipe and squeeze some more juice out. Gotta give credit where credit is due, a record is a record, Nara, and no one can take that away from you…except Exploder who got a 1:56.554 (-0.127) a week later. Gotta wonder when he’ll just say “fuck it” and “explode” for a 2/3. I’d rather have Nara or Justin get it tho bc the Europeans don’t deserve to have that on us. Congrats to both of you, especially Nara on that first record, and good luck on future improvements.<br><br>Moving on, Logan has continued striving for white supremacy over the WR scene by knocking off a (Luke) Brown person on Koopa Cape no-sc, by 0.043, with a time of 2:17.176. Logan decided after a mogi event or some shit that he wanted to get a PB on the category and of course, in typical Logan fashion, he pulled a record out of his ass. I think he may have put 30 minutes into the track before this session because I literally can’t remember another day of him playing the category. Good luck on the 2:16 Logan, Luke, Jongwoo, and/or anyone else who grinds for it. Will we see a 2:15 in the distant future?<br><br>LOGAN LOST A WR EVERYONE CELEBRATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!1!<br>Everyone’s favorite Austrian, Alperen (some call him Peter) got WR on MG no-sc by 0.078, with a time of 1:40.502. The funniest thing about this is that when I first joined the community Blaze’s 1:41.256 was seen as one of the strongest WRs in the game, and now three years later it’s been beaten by over .7 because of hopless gap, and now the new boost panel strat after the second mushroom section. Alperen will probably go back to TF no-sc (he thinks there’s two tracks in the game) so good luck to you there, but also good luck to you and anyone else looking to take this time down, it’s crazy that we might be seeing low 1:40s in the future.<br><br>I was really looking forward to talking about this one. WGM glitch is next up on our list, which means it’s time to talk about another old head that triumphed this month…what’s that? oh, yeah, RAY GOT HIS FIRST WORLD RECORD FIRST OMG WE’RE SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!! With a time of 31.755, by one millisecond, by the cock of his balls he got it. Who doesn’t love the occasional W3R that is also the actual record? The wii wheel proves once again that while it may be inferior, it is still inferior, because Poyo beat him anyways, with a time of 31.725 (-0.030). Poyo, as most of the community knows by now, was the first player to ever make 3/3 pipe bounces, way back in March 2009. He returned for not one, not two, but for THREE new records on WGM last year before being beaten by Logan in March. Poyo joins the list of older players that took big steps last month, but I have a feeling he won’t be the last one I talk about…<br><br>Our next record brings the heat (it’s desert hills, I had to make the joke I’m sorry y’all have no idea how hard I’m laughing rn). We saw two improvements on rDH no-sc, both by Sosis. Sosis achieved a time of 1:34.368 (-0.013) where he got two lucky cuts, but that isn’t enough, he wanted three. Ten days later, Sosis blew everyone’s mind, with a 3/3 wheelie cut run, and a time of 1:34.237, a massive cut of 0.131. Absolutely insane to see a run with three lucky's, Sosis deserves this one. 1:33 is most certainly doable, but is that something Sosis is willing to push for? What about Braixen? It will be interesting, good luck to anyone willing to grind for that goal, but a 3/3 lucky cut is a huge achievement regardless.<br><br>I’ve had enough of the heat, let’s go back to Koopa Cape. This time for the glitch, I wanna go skinny dipping. Kei beat Lawrence with a time of 1:56.276, a cut of 0.195. How tf is this the largest cut I’ve talked about? I wanna see some juice squeezed out in May. Massive congrats to Kei, this looks like torture to play as it is. This has been another one that’s been fun to watch go down. From Logan WR farming last summer to Justin shutting him up with the new glitch strat, to Lawrence and Kei battling it out doing the glitch on lap 2. Congrats Kei! Gotta wonder how realistic a 2/3 here could be as well…good luck Kei and Lawrence, things might get interesting soon, if they aren’t already.<br><br>Oh fuck, the desert again. Logan finally gets the time he’s somewhat satisfied with on DDR, beating Justin, who is probably theorizing an ultra shortcut on rMC3. Logan got a 1:46.748 (-0.093) first, but that lasted just over a week, before he completely destroyed the category. Logan went on to skip 1:46.6, .5, and almost .4, with a time of 1:46.400. What. a. run. One of the most tech heavy tracks in the game finally gets it’s big record, this is one that could last for a bit if Logan or Justin don’t pick it up again. They both agree that a 1:45 will be done humanly at some point, but it will likely take new strats. Is it time to start going inside the tree on the ultra? Or will we be doing the ultra with two shrooms? Only time will tell.<br><br>We can only follow up one legendary run with another. Braixen has done it once again this time on CM glitch, but this time, things look a little different. On APRIL FOOLS DAY OF ALL DAYS, tasser Epik95 showed a new, faster entry, only problem is that the entry is pregnant with QM, RNG, and holy shit Braixen made it two weeks later. Not without trial and error of course, he said he put in over 20k attempts. Braixen spent two weeks locked in his room, playing this category. Legend has it that he never slept, and he was so tired one night that he actually went into Coconut mall and bought food, only to find out that their ice cream machine was broken. Luckily it paid off for the mad man with a massive cut, a historical record, and a time of 26.106 (-5.205). Braixen said he lost at least a second on the landing alone, so this can still go down by quite a bit, but I don’t feel like anyone will be playing coconut mall like THIS anytime soon. Congrats on once again revolutionizing this category, Braixen, and whenever you want to go for more you will still probably have the record so you can relax now.<br><br>We aren’t finished yet, though. We saw one last legend come back, and it’s one everyone in the community loves. GV glitch watched Niyake prove once again that he doesn’t care that Jyran is still a child, that is his rock, and Jyran needs to go play with something else. Niyake drove around the GV rock in 15.425 seconds, a record by 0.072. Records on this track get more impressive every time I see them. I thought Niyake was joking in February 2021 when he said he was going for a 14 second time, but now even that doesn’t look impossible. Jyran and Niyake are both fantastic players at the tops of their game, and could go get an inhuman time if they wanted. That being said, I’m not sure how much motivation either player has to play the track rn (there are literally 31 other tracks) but of course, we here at the players page will keep you posted. <br><br>What? I have to talk about TAS AND flap records?? Fuck me, I’m gonna go take an angry shit. brb.<br><br>I’m back, and I’m not going in chronological order for flaps because fuck you, but Luke got GV no-sc flap record with a time of 35.530, could he possibly contend with Barney for the 3 lap record? Also, upload the video Luke, it’s annoying when flap records don’t have videos. It’s inconvenient for the mid tier players who’s flaps carry their timesheets (I am one of them)<br><br>Of course, Exploder got a 14.976 on RR glitch, this may or may not be the final month of the RR glitch shenanigans, it may be entering it’s Hunter phase on rWS where one specific player (this time not named Hunter) just grinds the shit out of the track for a 2/3. Whatever your plan is, good luck Walaker, I already talked enough about you.<br><br>Now that all two of the flap WRs have been taken care of, we can move forward with TAS shit! April fools day was great because there were 12 new Ultras discovered and no one knew which ones were real or not. Now that it’s May 4th I can confirm that BCwii has its ultra, courtesy of Jellopuff, a huge discovery! Unfortunately it requires super-grinding and is not RTA viable yet. This was also the same day of Epik95’s CM glitch TAS that I spoke about earlier. Of course April fools day was wrapped up by rBC ultra being faster with the zip zip, I love our TAS community.<br><br>Furthermore, we also saw a new ultra on rYF, discovered by Mikul, which also uses super grinding (and the egg in the middle lmfao). Unfortunately RTA-ers are gonna need to stick with the ultra long cut that is RTA viable for right now.<br><br>The final ultra discovered last month was on MH, and it was the next track to fall victim to the outside-drifting bike revolution. Monster discovered this less than a week from when I’m writing this and while it barely saves any time, it’s still an ultra shortcut. Gotta love this community.<br><br>Besides the April fools day shenanigans, and other ultras, we also saw these flap TAS BKT improvements<br>Justin improves his own rBC3 unrestricted bkt using superhopping<br>Kierio, Ancient, Police, and Campbell re-invent how rDH no ultra is played<br>Justin improves arguably the coolest looking flap TAS on rGV2 glitch<br>Kierio and Ejay bring superhopping to rDS<br>mkwLuke with his first individual TAS BKT in four years on MC glitch (on mach bike!?)<br>Kierio improves MT no glitch<br>Justin improves CM glitch<br>Jellopuff and Ejay improve DDR glitch (using an S tier texture while doing so)<br>Kierio improves TF nosc flap<br><br>I’m not going into detail about these because this is the players page news update, this is about the RTA community, the alpha males, not the beta nerds that play the same eight frames over and over for three hours! If you wanna check out the new TAS bkts for last month and see exactly what they changed on each frame, feel free to go to the MKW TAS website where every single TAS BKT, and former TAS BKT sits, just waiting for you to watch them. We love you, TAS community, keep doing your thing.<br><br>Alright my computer is about to die, I’ll write this next portion tomorrow. (I guess this is the part where I remind you to hydrate yourself?)<br><br><u><b>Anniversaries</b></u><br>This is a new mini segment I’m adding to celebrate the anniversaries of records! Bet Arvo and Arthur don’t do it like this, think of me as the cool guy from now on.<br><br>Happy ONE year Anniversary to Logan’s TF SC WR (1:44.308). One year ago last month Logan got bored and decided that TF was due for another improvement, he also used an Acquiesce (he’s a kangaroo) mii in the process. Will we see an improvement on TF SC this year? Who’s mii will Logan use this time? Or will we see a new challenger approach?<br><br>Happy TWO year anniversary to Invincible’s rDKJP glitch WR (41.072). Invincible set this when he was still making sure that Bryce (needs to show his lap 1 BKS) didn’t come back to the track to beat him. Invincible has hinted that he plans on playing this category this year, will we see an improvement? Or will Bryce finally come through with the 37 second time he’s been promising us?<br><br>I know we already talked about this one, but happy TWO year anniversary to Guy’s legendary 1:20.357 on MC no-sc. The first ever run with 3/3 King Alex ramp, and also the largest WR cut in the history of the category. With Caleb announcing his retirement last month, this blows the track wide open for one Kasey if he so desires to go for it, things are getting interesting.<br><br>Alrighty, looks like we’ve covered all the big news, now lets get to you fuckers. But first…<br><br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <font color=yellow>USA</font> brings it home this time because America, fuck yeah.

Please stop playing online, it makes you look bad<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#3</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#7</font>) <font color=yellow>Arvolord95</font> Played 3lap and flap on CM no glitch and improved them both. He also got his channel taken down on youtube, so no more last name in the news update for him. Poor guy had to re-upload every single video to his new channel. The next time he gets taken down he’s gonna have to move to pornhub with the rest of the banned youtubers. It’s truly a tough time to be a member of the anti-censorship community.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#4</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#9</font>) <font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen</font> Blew everyone’s mind by making the “humanly impossible” entry on CM glitch. Unfortunately he was so burnt out that he didn’t play anything else. I will say that record will stand for as long as he wants it to, no one is touching that until we have grandchildren.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#6</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#4</font>) <font color=yellow>Martin Fox</font> Improved his rBC no glitch (obviously) 3lap pb to a 2:31.4. Besides that he uploaded TWO lounge compilations. I think we can all agree that we prefer Fox the time trialist to Fox the mogimain.<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The Quarters, and half dollars (Top 50)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#12</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#15</font>) <font color=yellow>Zed R</font> Got passed up on red charts by ThomasNL, who hasn’t played in two years. What the fuck Colin. Also played some DDR 3lap and flap. Glad some of the top players still care about flaps!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#16</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#20</font>) <font color=yellow>Indy Kambeitz</font> Improved his…*checks notes* MG glitch flap? Weird category to play for your first PB of the calendar year. Hope to hear more from our friend Weexy as the year progresses.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#17</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#6</font>) <font color=yellow>Jay Rangthale</font> Got his record back on rDH no-sc and finally got the 3/3 lucky cut in a record. Huge congrats again. He also got an improvement on MT no-glitch as well, with a 2:17.8. Now we wonder if he’s gonna join Logan on the MMM grind…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#18</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#34</font>) <font color=yellow>Enzo Leussink</font> When he isn’t muted in the time trial server vc or quacking at his neighbors, Enzobozo likes to get pbs. Enzo improved his MC glitch 3lap and flap, and did the same on DDR. Good luck on the sub 53 on MC if you decide to go for it!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#19</font> (<font color=FF3333>#10</font>) <font color=yellow>Eclipse</font> formerly known as Fatality, Eclipse emerged from his annual hibernation to jump 21 fucking spots on the combined AF charts with 17 PRs, cutting nearly 30 total AF points. THAT is the type of activity we love to see, well done Ecal (Fatal is the abbreviation for Fatality, so that must mean Ecal is the abbreviation for Eclipse!) Hope to see another monster month from you, we’re glad you’re back!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#20</font> <font color=yellow>Caleb House</font> Announced his retirement at the ass crack of dawn but also got two PRs this month on BC sc 3lap and flap. I’ve talked about RAF Guy today and what he’s meant to this community, but if these are the last times you’ll ever upload to our website, we wish you the best in this next step in life. Don’t forget about us when you’re famous <3<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#21</font> (<font color=FF3333>#21</font>) <font color=yellow>Doge.</font> Formerly known on the site as Takeo, but known by everyone else as Doge, he finally changed his name to who he’s known as by most of the community…he also set a PB on rMC no-sc which is pretty cool considering rMC isn’t even a custom track that he can snag his 154th CT BKT on. I can’t shit on CT mains rn unfortunately because I was one last month, but we hope to see more RT PBs from you soon!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#22</font> (<font color=FF3333>#28</font>) <font color=yellow>Phyzothy</font> Hasn’t complained that the news isn’t out yet despite the fact that it is now May 9th as I am typing this, thank god. Also got an April Fool’s Day pr on rYF flap, random category but nice job Phyz. One complaint out of you though and I’m just gonna shit on you for not pbing since the TAS community’s christmas.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#25</font> (<font color=FF3333>#16</font>) <font color=yellow>Nick Meade</font> Our favorite content creator finally got his 2:30 on rBC, and is now going for I believe 1:30 on rMC. He also sadly dropped from 24 to 25 on combined AF charts, shame on you Eclipse! Nick set a handful of goals for himself to achieve that he believes he should’ve pulled off years ago. I don’t care when you get the time, Nick, we are so proud of you for showing us the power to mentally pull through after all these years. You are truly an idol to us all.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#26</font> (<font color=FF3333>#39</font>) <font color=yellow>Mitchell Healy</font> One of the seemingly countless young aussies taking over the scene known as Mitch jumped from 29 to 26 with eleven PRs. I feel like I updated Mitch’s timesheet nearly everyday whenever I updated times last month, and he’s having himself a hell of a year. Mitch now has his eyes on the top 25, but I doubt he will stop there. I’m excited to see where Mitch will rank by 2024, he is proving every day that he is one of the best in our game.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#27</font> (<font color=FF3333>#23</font>) <font color=yellow>Joeblase</font> Joe DeBlasio managed to get seven prs and fall down a spot (what the fuck) and also beat me like 30 times on BC no-sc online TTs a few days ago, but I beat him one or two times which proves I am the better player. Dude got a fucking 2:20.8 there right before the end of the month and has no intent of stopping. We wish you the best of luck on whatever the hell you plan on getting there. Joeblase for 2:19?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#30</font> (<font color=FF3333>#3</font>) <font color=yellow>Luke Brown</font> Went missing for a few weeks before coming out of nowhere with a GV no-sc flap record?? What a weird month dude. Would be crazy to see if you compete with Barney for the 3lap record, even though I know you’re taking yet another stab at rBC no-sc.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#31</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#24</font>) <font color=yellow>Kevin Miller</font> For a guy who “relies on flaps” you sure know how to play the game. Kevin cut nearly 4 AF points but unfortunately stayed put for April (spoiler alert he passed Luke in May) with a whopping 14 PRs (nine of which were 3lap you fraud). Maybe he will stop lying that his timesheet is carried by flaps as he continues to devour them.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#36</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#87</font>) <font color=yellow>Ryley Carroll</font> NMeade’s biggest fanboy is our latest example of players only pb-ing on MG glitch flap then dipping. Nick would be very disappointed if he learned about this, Mr. Hydr8ion.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#40</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#58</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> Managed to drop three spots on red charts and only one on blue despite his only PR for the month being a red-only category for him. I don’t understand anything anymore, writing this news update has been an experience of all time. That being said he improved his flap PR on rPB no-sc. Maybe Arrow should focus on making three glitches on that track instead :tf: <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#46</font> <font color=yellow>Lawrence</font> Got a pr on both 3lap and flap on MMM. Troy vs. DBG is so close to a 1:15 there…good luck if you choose to go for it! If not I’m sure you’ll come out with some crazy CT BKT at some point this month anyways.<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The Dollars (Top 100)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#53</font> (<font color=FF3333>#56</font>) <font color=yellow>Danny Boy</font> Forgot his name was no longer Neptune, and also submitted most of Eclipse’s times. Thankfully, when he wasn’t submitting times for Neptune (doesn’t exist) and Eclipse (not him) he submitted six prs and cut six AF points which is pretty neat, boosting him from 55 to 53 (and is 52 as of me writing this). One of those times was WW tops on RR glitch with a 1:59.4! Huge time man, good luck on whatever crazy glitch you try this month.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#55</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#52</font>) <font color=yellow>Will Marable</font> GOT ELEVEN PRS AND JUMPED 25 SPOTS ON THE COMBINED CHARTS HOLY SHIT!!!!!!!!!!1!!!1!!!!!11! Will had a monster month cutting over 37 AF points to boost him towards the top 50, the question is will he get there in May? Good luck on topping Will M’s April 2023, it will be difficult.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#56</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#88</font>) <font color=yellow>JAYOO</font> The pasta glitcher got 4 prs, cut one AF point, and dropped two spots on combined AF charts. Fucking bozo. I hope the rDH no-sc WR isn’t making you nervous about your rDH sc PR…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#61</font> (<font color=FF3333>#57</font>) <font color=yellow>Claus</font> Got a few prs on rPG no-sc. He likely has a goal there that I’m too lazy to ask him about. Good luck on that goal.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#63</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#70</font>) <font color=yellow>Ultra_Pear</font> Got a PR on 3lap and flap for DDR, including a fucking dank 3lap pb on 4/20 (based) stop running metroid u bum<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#64</font> (<font color=FF3333>#69</font>) <font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs</font> The toddler that’s good at grumble glitch jumped fucking 104 spots last update but played nothing but red charts (based) in April, getting two pbs on GV no-sc and CM no glitch, both 3 lap categories. Also he’s 69th on red AF charts, which makes me happy, but he’s too young to know what that means so he’s probably just gonna keep grinding for more. I’d stay put, but you do you bro<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#68</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#40</font>) <font color=yellow>Lee Duggan</font> Got a 1:43.5 on MH, which is something Arthur would go absolutely apeshit about, but I will resort to saying nice time, and good luck on future improvements.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#69</font> (<font color=FF3333>#129</font>) <font color=yellow>Nate Schultz</font> The fact that #69 is a member of bitch squad proves that there is a god. Bars. Also Mr. Schultz managed to jump 8 spots to the lucky number after a month consisting of 14 PRs and 17 AF points cut. Maybe he could double up and PLAY RED CHARTS and get 69 on both AF boards? Only time will tell if this bitch can pull it off. Also nice MT no-sc pr, there are 31 other tracks bruv.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#74</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#61</font>) <font color=yellow>Michele Gallastri</font> Somehow set a PR in October already (Arthur already used this joke, I don’t give two shits) but also got a PR on rSL no glitch with a 2:05.316. Pretty cool stuff.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#90</font> <font color=yellow>Idriz</font> Temporarily moved up to 89 before getting shot back down to 90, Idriz played mainly flaps but also played some RR no glitch, securing the W3R there. Wheel we be seeing a 2:24 from you soon? (see what I did there? Hi, I’m Benjamin Hurley, and I’m running for president.)<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#092</font> <font color=yellow>Exploder</font> FINALLY completed his BLUE timesheet. Still gotta finish that red one though, Mr. Walaker. Is also the current favorite to get the ever so anticipated RR glitch 2/3 before the calendar year ends.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#93</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#98</font>) <font color=yellow>Nara Hiero</font> Got his first WR, which is massive considering WHO THE FUCK WOULD’VE PREDICTED THAT????? Got 4 total prs, jumped 4 spots on combined AF charts, and cut 4 AF points. 444. What the hell?????<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#98</font> <font color=yellow>Starboi</font> Keeps raiding people in minecraft or some shit and pissing them off…wait this is the mario kart news update. He got a 1:30.6 on DC which is pretty cool, but outside of that minute and a half he was raiding people in minecraft and pissing them off.<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The Outlawed $2 bills (Top 200)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#104</font> <font color=yellow>Franco</font> The Swiss legend jumped one spot with two prs but gained 2 AF points. FINISH YOUR NO-SC TIMESHEET DAMMIT.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#105</font> <font color=yellow>Acquiesce</font> Everyone’s favorite kangaroo got a pr on LC flap and WGM no glitch 3lap. Nice job Joey!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#117</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#119</font>) <font color=yellow>Cederic</font> Jumped a whopping 13 spots with 14 PRs and cut over 13 AF points. Barely missing on a 13-13-13 month. Cederic is yet another example of a young player who has just barely scraped the bottom of the barrel in terms of their potential.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#124</font> (<font color=FF3333>#102</font>) <font color=yellow>Jadid</font> ANOTHER player with a fuck ton of PRs in April. 16 to be exact. He jumped ten spots on the combined AF charts but couldn’t quite cut ten AF points, and had to stick with nine. Looking for another big month from one of our favorite Italian cult members.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#129</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#128</font>) <font color=yellow>James Collins</font> My rival may have won the game, but the war is still only beginning. ObeisantBitch3808 got 5 PRs and jumped 4 spots while cutting 4 AF. A quiet month but I think he started university this past month (Australia schooling is fucking weird) so good on him for still playing the game. Maybe once I’m satisfied with the amount of gold stars I have I’ll start actually playing RTs again.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#139</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#104</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Hurley</font> I dropped a spot on both AF charts but I got a PB by like half a second on rBC which was pretty gnarly. Besides that I’ve turned to the dark side and have been playing CTs and lounge (RT lounge, I’m still sane guys don’t worry) since around mid month. I obviously plan to play RTs again but I feel like playing the CTs can help sharpen my skills, and patience, among other things. Good luck to myself next month. Also tears of the kingdom just came out so I might end up spending my summer playing that…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#145</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#164</font>) <font color=yellow>Carlo</font> Our next member of the MKW mafia (literally just another Italian) got ten PRs, cut 20 spots, and cut over 28 AF points. Carlo went on an absolute tear on his blue sheet, but he also got a few red chart pbs as well. Someone needs to convince these Italians to play more no-glitch categories, this is getting ridiculous.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#158</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#117</font>) <font color=yellow>Mystogan</font> Misto-Jen, or is it Misto-gen? Idfk you got 2 prs this month on TF no-sc 3lap and flap (best categories in the game), cutting one AF point but dropping one spot on the leaderboard. Regardless, a 1:51.3 is a respectable time, good shit!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#171</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#123</font>) <font color=yellow>Supreme</font> Got three PRs and didn’t move a fucking muscle. He didn’t even gain or lose any AF, he just stayed right where he was. I guess I still have to say something nice about you though, so, nice 2:09.4 on DKM, that track is a pain in the ass at any level.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#194</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#79</font>) <font color=yellow>Fraterz</font> Only played red charts bc fuck glitches. Fraterz also assisted Joeblase in humiliating me 20+ times on BC online TTs. Jokes aside it was crazy racing against you two, the times y’all were getting in such few tries were incredible.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#199</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#110</font>) <font color=yellow>Jesse Jay</font> Got 30 FUCKING PRS LAST MONTH OH MY GOD!!!!! Jesse cut over 56 AF points to just barely sneak into the top 200 before the news. Congrats on the huge month, Jesse, but we need to cook (breaking bad reference I’m so sorry you probably get this all the time)<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#200</font> <font color=yellow>Falco</font> How the fuck does this community have a fox, and a falco? Anyways he did the bare minimum last month to go from 201 to 200. 3 PRs. I bet it was just so that he could be in the top 200 in time for the April news update.

First of all I would like to say that I have not read a single news update this past year because everyone writes fucking boring news except me. I am far more creative, witty, funny than all of you, and still so humble and down to earth with no ego problems what so ever.<br><br>To restrain my urge to type multiple racial slurs in a row into this part of the news update I think it's best to just list off the old boring WR stuff before my ghost uploading privileges gets taken away by the MKW new world order (spoiler: the jews control CTGP)<br><br>Kasey improved his rPG by a tiny bit but we all know that it would still be a spear track if it wasn't for nintendo's hatred of automatic and knowingly creating stupid chain chomp cycles, not a real WR in my book<br><br>Logan got 3 WRs. Very impressive since he said he would quit 3 years ago to pursue a college degree. Very peculiar indeed!<br><br>Some random child using the wii wheel got WGM glitch wr<br><br>Luke (Most washed up player in MKW history) used a new strat that saves .150 a lap to barely get a WR on BC3 that lasted like 3 weeks lololol<br><br>Vincent N was grinding the new RR glitch until Neptune (yes I am deadnaming him, his new name is stupid) got a 2/3 run. He will truly go down in MKW WR history as a revolutionary player as the likes of Konata, 4vex and Arvo. (Randoms who fluked a WR and nobody will know who they are in 5 years)<br><br>Sosis got a few MMM wrs to make ZeldaCubed cry (he will never get a WR)<br><br>kei pushed MC so far that Logan will never get that WR again, respect<br><br>Braixen's paranoia of not having the CM glitch WR took over him and he just had to get another one. Bro like nobody else has even tried the new thing you don't have to stress so much<br><br>Oh yeah and Lawrence got KC glitch WR but everyone knows that glitch doesn't count<br><br>Kierio04 uploaded a stupid youtube short that contained false information<br><br>There is a player on the site called \"FEET TOES\". I just want everyone to let that sink in for a moment.<br><br>Ok yeah that was pretty boring but give me a break I'm old and out of touch and these news updates can't write themselves (actually we did some tests with ChatGPT and I think they probably can write themselves soon)<br><br>Let me do some of these sections that the new kids added<br><br><u><b>Anniversaries</b></u><br><br>July 15 1799 - The Rosetta Stone is found in the Egyptian village of Rosetta by French Captain Pierre-François Bouchard during Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign.<br>July 15 1941 - Nazi Germany begins the deportation of 100,000 Jews from the occupied Netherlands to extermination camps.<br>July 15 1983 - Nintendo released the Famicom in Japan.<br>July 15 2006 - Twitter, later one of the largest social media platforms in the world, is launched.

I played some rSL thanks to inspiration from Aura. He might have outmatched me but we're both on regs now so I am happy. Then did some GV glitch and got a time, DKS flap also and got WW tops after about 73 hours of attempts, 3lap coming soon (not soon at all)<br><br><font color=yellow>#3 Jack Gluesing</font> He might be ahead of me on the AF charts but this is my news update and I choose who's on the top!!!! He played like a million things and completely destroyed my podium position. Some of the highlights were making the RR glitch and falling off afterwards Korben style. Also got a 1:58.3 BC3 sc which is just fucking nuts what the hell. I could go on for so long with the praise but I will just say that you're a god damn monster at this game, may the rate of your progress be everlasting. Check again next year and I will put you ahead of me in the next news update I write, that's a promise<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Vincent Braixen</font> Yeah he got that cm thing<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 Vincent Nguyen</font> is a better man than me for 1:15 MMM, also the previously mentioned RR glitch and also 1:58.5 BC3 how is everyone so good at BC3 all of a sudden also 2:27 RR, I wonder if thats with the Twinkle Star idk cba to check. Then he also made rWS glitch. I need to move on to someone else because I'm getting too jealous at godlike abilities on categories I am god awful at<br><br><br><font color=red>11-25</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Indy Kambeitz</font> is like, getting some times including a 1:50.6 on rWS. weexy<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 Mitchell Healy</font> got a 1:49.827 on rWS glitch. Everybody laugh.<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Jay Rangthale</font> yeah the MMM stuff you know it already<br><br><font color=yellow>#19 Eclipse</font> let's look at the definition of Fatality's fancy new name!<br><br>Eclipse: A falling into obscurity or decline, also: the state of being eclipsed. \"His reputation has fallen into eclipse.\"<br><br>yeah sounds about right he didn't really get anything that good<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#20 Doge.</font> TF 1:49 quite tasty, other times weren't tasty enough to note down<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Dane Allen</font> TF 1:49 aswell!!! But unfortunately runs into the same issue as Doge.<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Jake Harrison</font> got a 1:48.2 and was so embarrassed that the vid of it is unlisted. You need to work on your confidence buddy<br><br><br><font color=red>25-50</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#26 Ross Coleman</font> bruh what year is it, this dinosaur still plays? Yeah he's washed as hell what are these random times<br><br><font color=yellow>#29 Kevin Miller</font> had to suffer the terrible fate of receiving messages from lowercaseletters just so he can relay them onto me (still not sure why) MKW-wise he got nice subs on RR and rSL flap. Congratulations!<br><br><font color=yellow>#30 Luke Brown</font> other than the previously mentioned he got a 1:09.287 on LC with the bowser bike. Jokes aside that's absolutely fucking nuts<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 Ryley Carroll</font> dude literally drove a 1:49.2 on TF glitch 3 days ago to get a news update mention. He couldn't play for months due to unbelievable grief from Sanna Marin losing the Finnish prime minister title so it's fair, hope you're coping.<br><br><font color=yellow>#40 Jacob Fitzgibbon</font> played some cheeky LC but mostly spent the months looking up obscure sports facts<br><br><font color=yellow>#43 Neptune</font> got RR 2/3 of course, also he got rWS 1:50.7, LC 1:09.5 and TF 1:50.9. I made those last 3 up, sorry about that<br><br><font color=yellow>#44 Lawrence</font> got a run on RR glitch (wow what a surprise) and CM glitch and KC glitch and TF glitch flap. Wait wtf he also got 1:15 on MMM. So he can play something else than glitches i am shocked<br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#53 JAYOO, the proud holder of the fastest lap in MKW history</font> got MC 50.3 (wow!) and CM 33.2 (wow!) and GV2 glitch 52.4 (fuck you) and rDH 1:33.9 (just kidding) and 2:00 rPG (also kidding)<br><br><font color=yellow>#54 JMM435</font> got a 1:57.7 on CM. Knowing JMM i am sure he did infi tricks in this run<br><br><font color=yellow>#55 Exploder</font> got PR's on like 90% of the tracks there aint no way in hell im going throuh allat<br><br><font color=yellow>#58 Claus</font> got a 2:05 on MT in the year of our lord 2023. Dude you gotta get with the times and get on that 2/3 game (inb4 that is a 2/3 run)<br><br><font color=yellow>#60 Alex Shoal</font> made his annual return to prove to everyone and he's still got it and the arthritis has not completely destroyed his frail joins yet. He got WW tops on rSL. You can just tell from his timesheet that he is 40 years old since he still doesn't have a BC3 no sc time over a decade after it became a recognized category<br><br><font color=yellow>#72 Nara Hiero</font> did what <font color=yellow>#72 Nara Hiero</font> does best, randomly getting a WR on a sub-5 second flap category. This time it was on MG. You can tell tiktok has ruined his attention span just by looking at his top times, man can't concentrate on driving for more than 5 seconds. He also got a time on WGM glitch flap but that is a whopping 9 seconds long so it was only ww tops.<br><br><font color=yellow>#78 Nathan Socholotiuk</font> had himself a sub session, getting 1:51 rWS, 2:13 BC glitch, 2:22 BC ng and TF 1:50. If you can't sub what's even the point of playing anything.<br><br><font color=yellow>#80 Mo No</font> finally got his 1:49 TF, skipping .9 altogether. Divine justice for him.<br><br><font color=yellow>#90 Idriz</font> is one of the players of all time. His nearly 450-year old comeback after getting 1:17.5 on MMM back in 1547 is completely out of this world. Getting a 2:06.5 rDS in 1994 really put him on the map, but the fact he is still getting times nearly 5 centuries after getting into MKW is something else.<br><br><font color=yellow>#100 Acquiesce</font> is one of the great artists of the game. His tormented soul weeps for recognition that often slips through his fingers. This time his sorrow-filled driving lead to a 1:21.960 on MC and a 59.194 on rYF. I sympathise with you my brother-in-arms, for this game is a mere repressed memory within your deepest desires.<br><br><br><font color=red>The players that are starting to get hard to write about</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#103 Franco</font> cheeky old 2:12.5 bc and 2:30 rr<br><br><font color=yellow>#106 Cederic</font> rank 69 on rSL glitch haha<br><br><font color=yellow>#124 Jadid</font> got 2 times that don't make the top 150. Literally what do you want me to say<br><br><font color=yellow>#126 James Collins</font> ok shit there's a ton of vids I can say something funny here! OK his TF 1:52.0 description says he really likes the bgm he used but he didn't like enough to say what song it was. Thanks. Also there is an error message at the end of the video that I've never seen before. Thank you ObeisantBug 3808 (fuckin Cicada 3301 ass username)<br><br><font color=yellow>#138 Flooferdog</font> 1:16.7 MMM. First sub? Don't know.

How about that… I know you’ve missed me, and even if you didn’t, I do not care. As I’m here today, I offer you a brand new essay to sum up everything that has happened in the last few (actually not so few) weeks. Enjoy…<br><br>But before we get deep into the big stuff, let me introduce you with this little paragraph (that's totally not being written last second because we forgot about it) to the <font color=red><u>Player of the Year 2023</u></font> voting! As always, it's a little poll for you all to decide which Karter stood out the most during the past year. Right now, you can go submit a list of 5 players maximum you want to nominate for this poll, and the 5 players with the highest number of votes get in that last decisive poll that'll be made in a week or two. You thus have little time to nominate, so I encourage you to go on the Player's Page Forum and place down your nominations list right now and right <a href=\"https://www.mariokart64.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1707397566/0#0\">here.</a><br><br><br><u><b>So, what has happened since the last News?</b></u><br><br>Well, at first, basically nothing lmao. In July and August we saw a grand total of 5 WRs with August only getting ONE of them, the fewest we've seen since April 2016! Truly the WR scene is bleeding, since there isn’t as much activity at top level as there used to be, honestly expected due to the game’s age (no wayyy who would’ve thought) and the MK8DX DLC that came out during the year. Logan literally took a break to play MK8 at one point, and this really pushed down the WR activity (although his break wasn’t that long and he still got 15/32 records this update lol). We also saw the likes of Kasey, Sosis, Luke, Braixen and others setting WRs alongside Logan this News cycle. Let’s talk about it.<br><br>First off, your usual Logan records. He became the 2nd player to break the 100 WR tally, after Luke, on July 22nd when he got a 1:28.411 on DC beating his former PR by .013. He came back to the track in January (this News is way overdue) to get a second PR, this time getting the first .3 with a 1:28.372. He then went on to focus on TF where he improved the Shortcut category 3 times finishing with a 1:44.178 right at the start of September, and improved the Non-Shortcut category once with an \"ever so slightly closer to a 1:48\" 1:49.039 on August 28th. Yes it's that one WR that avoided a 0 WR month and yes that means we cut a WHOPPING 35ms off the No-Glitch WR Total Time in August. Surely it's the smallest time cut in quite some time.<br><br>Then he went on good old GCN Mario Circuit and literally got 4 WRs in a week to get that insane sub 1:30, a 1:29.945 on the last day of September. That allowed him to narrowly beat Luke and become the guy with the most WRs ever at 108 WRs entering October.<br><br>Also remember when I said Logan played MK8? Well he literally got WR on the newly added MH there for a bit meaning he held both the MKW and MK8DX WRs of the track at the same time lmao that’s our champ<br><br>Sosis also got a little mad that Logan dared to take MMM from him a few months ago, so he took it back and improved it as we've seen in the prior News Update, except he was really mad apparently because he improved again! The American becomes the first player to sub .3 with a 1:15.273 on July 25th, ggs Saucisse you’re a beast on your tracks as always<br><br>We then get to Kasey who continues to break down rPG, getting the first 1:58.8 with a .890. Considering the fails that he's gotten recently, we'll probably hear more about the track in the next Update. I totally didn’t write that 4 months ago, Kasey definitely touched the track since and hasn’t gone on other tracks at all! I mean what I wrote is still relevant cuz we might see the track next News Update… <br><br>However that's not his big WR for September, and that one surely requires an entire paragraph so hold on let me press enter twice rq<br><br>15 years of MKWii and he seemed to always have one world record. 15 years, and through LC, rYF, RR, rPB and plenty of other tracks, he remained one of the top tier karters all this time. His reign on his ace track was utterly insane, covering by himself almost half a second on a track where it's difficult to save even a frame at this level. He remained the owner of the track for more than a decade. And after a tie that seemed almost unbelievable, someone was, in the end, able to end this ownership. The track is LC, and as you probably guessed by now, someone other than Cole is now the sole proprietor of the track, and that guy is obviously Kasey that made history on September 30th with a 1:08.733. Cole's reign was established with a 23 consecutive WR streak that went on for 3702 days, so 10 years, one month and 19 days, from August 11th, 2013 to September 30th, 2023. It stands as the #1 longest lasting reign in the history of the game, #2 being MrBean on WGM Glitch with 2772 days. Cole's last WR was the one that lasted the longest in his reign by a landslide with 1404 days as the record, that's his 2nd longest lasting WR after the 58.970 on rYF, and just like that, one of the all time greats of the game is left with no record for the first time in years. All I need to say now is huge congrats to Kasey and, well, the king's dead, long live the king. May you be the one to improve this track even further.<br><br>I said Logan got his 1:29 on rMC on September 30th, and Kasey also broke LC on that same day, right? Well, well, let me tell you something: I had never seen this happen before, but on that last day of the month, 2 <i>other</i> WRs were set, by 2 different players, on 2 different categories, meaning we actually got 4 people getting 4 records on 4 categories all in one day. How cool is that. You can say the last 2 categories are just Glitch and No-Glitch of one single track, but still…<br><br>And btw, it’s rBC I’m talking about. We first saw Luke finally break through and end his drought on the track by getting a 2:30.573, only a 9ms improvement sadly but enough to get a new record, plus at this level even a frame is hard to cut off on this track (absolutely not speaking from experience I am not a god at this track with my dumb mid 2:32) so congrats to Luke. On the Glitch side, Logan’s first successful run was defeated more than 1000 days after it was set, and the man to do it was, obviously, Mr (now former) 2nd Worldwide who didn’t get thwomped this time around, Core with a 2:20.406. Crazy to think that this was only the 2nd record we had on the category…<br><br>After this busy last day came October and we got 6 WRs to talk about here… Yeah 4 of them are Logan’s what do you want me to do about it<br><br>First off, who would’ve thought that after a 1000 days drought on rBC Glitch we would see 4 new WRs in quick succession? Definitely not me. After Core’s run, another glitcher managed to get the record, and as the holder of RR Glitch Danny Boy became a multi-WR holder for the first time in his life by getting the sub 2:20 with a 2:19.908 on the 7th of the month. It wouldn’t last long though, because as he saw there was some competition, Logan joined to get some fun with the lads and ruined it by setting a 2:18.963 on October 16th and a 2:17.997 the day after, that’s why you can’t party with the boys Logan that’s because you’re too strong be gentle sometimes! :rainiosmile:<br><br>On the same day as Logan’s last rBC run, Luke also got close to BC3 No-SC, climbing all the way to 4ms behind Logan! We all thought “wow that was so close” for 30 minutes until he got another run going and beat Logan to get a 2:16.183, first time subbing .2, nice work from the English. With that he also climbs to #1 in terms of number of WRs on the category with 8. The ultimate goal still is that insane 2:15, and it is achievable, so good luck Luke you have what it takes<br><br>And then we got… Oh shit MOONVIEW MENTIONED RAAAAAHH BEST TRACK IN THE GAAAAAAAME where Logan improved his 1 year old record twice in the same 11-hour stream (oof) with a 1:42.984 (smol) and a 1:42.975 (also smol) on October 21st. I had watched the runs because, well, Moonview lmao, and tbh even though I hadn’t played the category in literal years I couldn’t but notice the timesave we could get on this. And turns out, I was right, since Logan got a .872 just a week later. Pretty interesting developments on this track, but still, I’m sure it can go down lower. Maybe in 2024 we’ll see a .7?<br><br>And then, the desert. The void. Nothing. No WRs for almost a full month, and only one lonely WR in November. The track? MG Non-SC. The savior? You guessed it, Alperen, with a 1:40.494, subbing 1:40.5 for the first time here.<br><br>December was more on the busy side, with 6 WRs set. Still not much, but it’s honest work by Braixen, who returned to his favorite track’s No-Glitch category and thus improved CM Non-SC a whopping 5 times in just 10 days from December 9th to December 19th. Pretty cool. He started off with the first 1:55.3 with a .360 (no scope) then grinded it down to a .264. He sadly couldn’t reach that goal of a .1 he set himself, but I’m sure he’ll get it. Stay strong and finish the job man!<br><br>Mario Kart Wii is a game that’s been dominated by the USA for a few years now. And among the countless American WRs we had, how fitting for the last WR of the year to be set by a Spaniard? Just before Christmas Eve, Poyo thus reclaims his WGM Glitch throne from Ray once again with a .678<br><br>The first WR of the year on the other hand, is fully American, as Vincent takes home the Raceway crown, beating Sosis with a 1:41.193 on January 6th. A great way to start the year for the #5 US player and for the game as a whole too since Sosis’ time lasted for more than 2 years!<br><br>Justin does what Justin does best, and it’s releasing a vid of a WR nobody expected at a time nobody expected either. Former World #1 takes .387 off of the rDH Glitch WR to lower it to a 1:30.603, mostly thanks to the first-ever sub 30 lap to be featured in a WR run, a 29.896 right at the end to finish it off. Great job as always.<br><br>The maestro of DKS has fallen and now has a rival worthy of his prestige! Blake got his WR taken by Connor who, despite losing his streak of getting a WR each year from 2017 to 2022, hasn’t left the game and still hits us hard with a 1:44.568 on January 26th. Will Blake be able to take the crown back? He’s trying. Will Connor improve his newly acquired WR? Maybe. Only time will tell.<br><br>Oh right, guess what? Flap time! We got 31 Flaps to cover (god that’s so much) on various tracks, mostly from Unrestricted, and yeah, mostly from Logan lmao<br><br>Chronologically, Vincent \"MostCommonNameEver\" Nguyen reclaimed his RR glitch WR from Danny \"former planet\" Boy with a 14.675, first time subbing .7, then to my surprise (and probably a few others) Luke came back on LC, of all tracks, to hit the ramp and finished a 21.590, subbing .6 for the first time and becoming the first player to set a Flap WR on the track using the Bowser Bike, and that's fucking huge.<br><br>Then… Logan subbed 43.7 on KC No-Glitch, stole DDR from Justin by one millisecond and got the first ever 32 lap on MH. 43.678, 32.491, 32.991, all of these are WRs. The interesting part here is that, well, he got them all in one day, August 18th. OK Mr. Kebabby<br><br>OMG I got someone that we don't see often. Carter Clem! No, not the Carter from rPG, that's another one. After getting his maiden WR on MT Flap in November last year, he strikes again and improves on August 22nd to a 23.608, beautiful. Congrats man!<br><br>And then for the Flap WRs set in September, we got… Logan again oh f<br>The American improves his rMC Glitch flap yet again, now he's so used to it that he doesn't even need to save the ghost, he casually set his WR then reset his run as if nothing happened. Thankfully it was on stream lol. He also got 2 WRs on TF Shortcut just because poor Mitch tried to get the record and Logan got mad so he cut more than .1 to a 31.592. But guess what, he's not the only guy who can set WRs!<br><br>On BC Non-SC, improving to a 45.760, Fraterz gets his maiden flap WR, beating Justin by .143. Finally we get someone new! Congrats on the record, hopefully you'll hold on to it!<br><br>In October, Shane cut 1ms on his CM Glitch Flap… Then cut 1ms on his CM Glitch Flap again, excuse me? You’re going from a 4.122 to a 4.120 with 2 WRs?? Tbh, if you could get to 4.099 with 20 more records that’d be pretty funny so keep on cutting those milliseconds bro<br><br>Lawrence improved his KC Glitch with a good 15.854, a few months after his previous one, gj gj sadly I don’t have much to say I don’t see anything special about it but a record is a record so congrats!<br><br>In the last 10 years, only 2 people had held the rWS No-Glitch Flap WR. Those being Totom for more than 7 years and Justin for almost 3. That was until October 17th, where Australian track specialist Falco got to work and set a godly time of 35.132, beating Justin by 2ms and getting the first Flap WR of his career in style. Congrats man!<br><br>The last 2 Flap records we got are on rBC Glitch, they’re just glitch laps of the 3lap records we mentioned previously: Danny got a 30.776 beating Core’s flap, then although Logan didn’t beat it in his 2:18, his 2:17 subbed 30 for the first time with a 29.752. Pretty cool.<br><br>Sadly, no new Flap WRs were set in November. It’s pretty strange to think that even though the PP’s activity didn’t change, it even got better, the WR scene almost went silent for the whole month. Sad.<br><br>December made it up for it tho, since we actually got a third of the Flap records for this Update during this month! <br><br>The Italian lad, the Mii-abusing time-updating man himself, Jayu, got 3 WRs (omg) on GV glitch (ehhhhh) at the start of the month, with a stating 2.805, subbing 2.791 and finishing 2.785 from December 7th to December 11th. Nice job my dear coworker<br><br>Then, the updating team had a brilliant idea: because the standards are just way too old and outdated, but we still wanted for all Gods to be hit, we thought it would be cool to set up a bounty for whoever would manage to get at least one of the last few remaining God standards of rSL Non-SC, rYF, and GV Non-SC flaps. And guess who took our (Hydr8ion’s) money? The #1 European TTer, the first one to get 100 WRs, you guessed it, it’s Luke! He improved GV Non-SC twice, first to a 35.528 on December 15th then to a 35.486 three days later. He thus got a grand total of 30$. Jackpot, Luke!<br><br>Back to TF Shortcut, where after the Mitch vs Logan event, we saw a 3rd karter shoot his shot at the record, successfully this time. Jack Gluesing thus got a 34.811 and 34.806 both on the same day of December 16th. Great job from Mr rSGB Glitch Flap!<br><br>Did you know that JMM’s rSL Glitch flap is the only WR of the category to surpass 1000 days? Well sadly, it won’t pass 1100 days because it just got beaten by Wii Wheel extraordinaire Ray on the 27th of the month, with a 10.584, barely 3ms ahead of the Portuguese. From one Chad to another.<br><br>The last few flap records of the year were set by βτ member and rMC god Bickbork himself, on, your guessed it again (this is starting to feel like a game show), rMC, where he beat his former WR from mid 2022 by exactly .1 from a 28.451 to a .351 on the 28th, then again with a .324 two days later the day before New Year’s Eve. And with that, the 2023 season comes to an end. Goodnight…<br><br>Wake up!!! It’s the first of the month! Well actually it’s not the first it’s the 12th of January, but KingAlex, the one and only, returns with a banger as he gets BC Shortcut flap setting two times of 41.865 and 41.722 later on the 25th, with the… Spear?? Yeah, the lad heard of a way to make the BC ending shortcut RTA, and thus went on to try it, setting the first Spear flap WR on the track since Jorge’s 42.723 in… 2010. That’s a long time and long-overdue return for both the vehicle and the karter.<br><br>The last (finally) WR to talk about for this update comes from Blake, obviously on DKS, where Mr. Germany got a 33.741 on January 24th. He might have lost his 3lap record to Connor, but this man is still unbeaten on the flap for almost 10 years, ever since his subbing 33.989 on May 29th, 2014. Standing the test of time. <br><br>Wait it’s not the last Flap record! Falco improved his rWS Flap to a 35.119 just to piss me off after I wrote his last part on stream, this bozo didn’t even record his time too or at least it’s not on the Flap WRs sheet, but he got another paragraph about him for this update so congrats Falco (don’t ever do this again or I will make your walls my new home)<br><br>I feel like it’s worth mentioning it, but Liam’s rDH No-Glitch Flap WR is still standing, and as of January 30th, literally the day I’m writing this, this 29.317 turns 8. years. old. 2922 days old. That’s the longest a record has ever stood, more than Thomas’ 41.425 on DKJP Shortcut set in 2015 that took 7.5 years to beat and lasted 2781 days. Will Liam’s record last 3000 days? It seems so, and it would be insane to see. If you don’t want it to hit that milestone, get to work, because it should hit it on April 17th. You know what to do.<br><br>That's every WR we got since Arvo's Update, now let me introduce you to a more interesting part of this News because MKW can't exist without… the pause-buffering drama ofc<br><br>What happened? To make it short, in early September we realized that Justin paused a lot when setting 2 of his KC WRs, while making the glitch. Asked about it, he replied that he buffered the pause button to get the glitch more consistently. Now, if you're familiar with the rules, you might remember that pause buffering is not allowed, therefore Justin's runs have to be considered as cheated runs. They have been removed from the Player's Page. If you ever wondered, no, we did not consider banning him at any moment, given the issue being minimal (only 2 times and one PR), and the fact that we never ever banned someone for pause buffering.<br><br>That brought a question though, because even though he pause buffered to get the glitch more consistently, he still drove a WR time by pure skill and didn't \"cheat\" for the rest of the run. Should we really ban his runs then? To avoid moments like this in the future, why shouldn't we allow pause buffering altogether? The debate rises again after its first appearance for the rPG flower hop back in 2018, and we thus hosted a vote on the matter both on the public and private TT servers. We asked if players wanted to keep the rule as it is, pause buffering being disallowed, or debanning the method, allowing people to pause the game at any time for any reason. The result dropped a few months ago (lol I delayed this News way too much), and the \"keep it\" option beat the \"deban\" option, 124 to 85, 60% in favor of Pause Buffering being banned. Sadly I don't have access to the private server so idk how it turned out there but since I've heard nothing from them it's probably the same result I just told you. To sum up the thing, Justin paused to make his KC Glitch easier, it's banned so his runs using pause buffering are not taken into account anymore, he's not banned, we held a poll on whether or not we should unban pause buffering or not, the community decided to keep the rule as it is. Idk why but I feel like we're gonna meet up again in 3-4 years on the exact same topic and redo a poll on should we ban pausing<br><br>On a more fun note AGDQ happened and Logan went there with Blake and ZeldaCubed to make a 32-track skips run, he finished in 1h10mins so yeah pretty good stuff, very nicely done.<br><br>Anyway that's all for now, time for the part of the News that's gonna get me terminal brain cancer by age 25 if I keep doing it<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE “MONTH”:</u></font> <font color=yellow>Australia</font> gets it because Mitch multiplied their activity by 5 and they were already very active in the first place, but since it’s been so long I actually want to also give it to <font color=yellow>Italy</font> as they also were very active and are stepping up so much it would be a shame to not mention it.

He got a top 10 time on CM flap.  <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#18</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#9</font>) <font color=yellow>Eclipse</font> got a 1:31.2 on rMC, a 59.0 on rYF, 42.4 on BC flap, and a 3lap and flap on TF sc.  These prs helped him ECLIPSE into the #18 spot for Unrestricted. God I need to get some sleep<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#19</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#18</font>) <font color=yellow>Dane Allen</font> enters Top 20 with what looks like a PR dump, probably for the first time as well because I don’t recall seeing him in there? Good job if that's the case<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#20</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#8</font>) <font color=yellow>Jay Rangthale</font> dropped 2 spots but hey he improved his rPG so that’s cool I guess<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#22</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#31</font>) <font color=yellow>Enzo Leussink</font> played no glitch, getting a couple of pretty decent times, unfortunately he was not as fast as his competitor, Enzo Ferrari, acted by Adam Driver in the film Ferrari which came out on Christmas Day.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#23</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#27</font>) <font color=yellow>Jake Harrison</font> popped in for a couple quick PRs, most notably getting 1:41 on rMR and a 1:22.0 on rSGB.  Good stuff Mr. Canada.  Unfortunately these PRs did not help Canada in the World Juniors where they lost to Czechia.  Absolutely embarrassing.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#26</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#30</font>) <font color=yellow>Phyzothy</font> only improved on BC Shortcut with a 2:10.8, dropped 2 spots, here’s your long-awaited News Update, sorry for the wait but you wouldn’t have made it into it if it weren’t delayed so badly lol<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#29</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#3</font>) <font color=yellow>Luke Brown</font> set two 3lap WRs during this time, on rBC and rBC3.  More importantly, however, was his contribution to LC flap.  He set a 21.590 using the bowser bike. It truly changed the category, making it significantly easier and faster.  He also got the first God standard time on GV No-SC flap, completing one part of the bounty.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#30</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#23</font>) <font color=yellow>Kevin Miller</font> played a couple of tracks to defend his spot as #1 Pennsylvania.

I did some flapping, got a .4 on LC, finally got rid of my disgusting rPG rank, etc.  I got ww tops on rDH back at a meetup.  Maybe one day I’ll finally get RR glitch done and cut like 8 AF.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#32</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#38</font>) <font color=yellow>Danny Boy</font>JAYU INVASION STARTS. Our Boy Danny Boy (i know) cut a ridiculous 21 AF from the previous update, with an insane fluk-2:19 on rBC glitch, which was of course world record at the time (waw), 1:40 on rWS glitch and 2:04 on KC glitch. this timesheet is making me emotional jesus christ, good job Danny keep up the gaming.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#34</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#42</font>) <font color=yellow>Shane Hogan</font> Shane lost AF, point and laugh people. jokes aside the duck man didn’t play much but for how much he played, he PLAYED. My guy blessed us with 2 WRs on CM glitch flap (zapalapadawg really cut 2 ms in a span of 3 WRs), GV glitch almostER (get 15 bozo), a 1:47 on DKSC (actually cracked) and LC FLAP (nobody cares). <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#36</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#66</font>) <font color=yellow>Exploder</font> OK EXPLOSION COOKED. He cut more AF than Danny with a staggering 24, the highlights of his baking process were yet another rYF 58 (big shock huh) that got him to 3rd, 1:49.4 on DKS and 1:29.8 on DC. he almost completely revamped his timesheet in the last months, big congrats Exploder!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#39</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Lawrence</font> hohoho we got another glitch guy here, Lorenzo landed a 15.8 on KC glitch flap, that makes me timbers shiver, a 1:45.4 on box factory (that is pretty good), and a really classy 1:49 on the box factory without the box.  <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#41</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#24</font>) <font color=yellow>Shaun Tanney</font> didn’t know he still played tts, he got a 1:49 on toddle’s factory too, great. i have nothing else to say other than END OF JAYU INVASION GOODBYE.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#44</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#80</font>) <font color=yellow>JAYOO</font> …What just happened? I was gone eating the pizza Jayu sent me and now there’s stuff written everywhere here. Must’ve been the wind… Anyway, the frenchie’s back for some more updates. This guy I totally don’t know about sets multiple Flap WRs and holds the fastest lap in MKW History, quite nice, with those flap WRs also came a 17.312 3lap set on the last day of the update that’s 7th WW and 3rd EU so that’s pretty cool stuff as well from this lovely stranger! Also he made Parkway, TF and RR glitch, got a 59.3/18.4 duo on rYF (what the actual fuck), surely he must be pretty decent at this game but I can’t know every player sadly!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#46</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#67</font>) <font color=yellow>Nara Hiero</font> breaks into Top 50 for this News Update while lowering his AF to below 100 for the first time in the process! The PRs that made it happen you may ask? Surprisingly, not much, just beating a few below-average times such as rBC, BC3 or …BC, the guy played all 3 BCs in a single month, that’s even crazier than the Top 50 if you ask me… Great progression I see there, surely there’s more to come!<br><br><br><font color=red><u>They're talked about (Top 100)</u></font><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#51</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#50</font>) <font color=yellow>Will Marable</font> Beat me on DC, rPG and fucking Moonview of all tracks, all within 2 months cuz he only played in October and November, and still managed to set times in rBC (also beats me), DKM Glitch (at least I don’t play that category) and CM Glitch (fucking annihilates me). Now if you may, I shall give the next portion of the News to my colleagues and friends while I’m crying in my bed because all my good times are sweeped like they’re nothing. See ya in a few minutes<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#54</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#59</font>) <font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs</font> had a couple of runs early in the period, but has gone absolute ham recently.  He’s submitted a bunch of times over the last few days, like 1:43.8 on MH, sub 2:01 on rPG, and a ton of flaps.  well done mr. australia  wait a minute, he got 1:00 on rPB??? I didn’t even know that, good stuff <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#58</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#86</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Loerzel</font> is… TIED IN AF WITH JMM?? I have never ever seen this happen. It’ll surely not be the case for long, it may not even be the case when the News releases, so I just wanted to highlight that because it’s super cool. Also his DKJP WR turned 1000 days old this News cycle, time really flies.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#60</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#51</font>) <font color=yellow>Claus</font> cut AF but gained 2 spots, womp womp<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#62</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#148</font>) <font color=yellow>Intel Core</font> as he always does demonstrates his insane glitch ability, pulling off improvements on RR, KC, and CM.  Most importantly, however, was the fact that he hit a WR on rBC glitch! Great job! Also a lot of solid nosc improvements, well done Core!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#63</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#125</font>) <font color=yellow>Nate Schultz</font> seems to be unfortunately running out of new somewhat easy glitches to do. Because of this, he has had to improvise, getting improvements on rPG, LC flap, etc… He also got tops on WGM glitch flap (and promptly had aaron w (big anti flap guy) to record it) <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#64</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#69</font>) <font color=yellow>Ultra_Pear</font> improved on rSGB and got an incredible 3rd ww time.  Absolutely insane stuff to see.  Later on in this time period, he worked on he timesheeted a bit, playing rDS, DKSC, and LC flap. Truly one of the players of the game.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#69</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Bryce</font> takes what once was Alberto’s property, the sought-after <font color=#33AADD>#69</font> spot… Maybe if you finished your No-SC timesheet you could get your hands on both titles and become the king of the Player’s Page??? Just saying…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#75</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#11</font>) <font color=yellow>Filler</font> played MMM, TF and rPG during summer break, although his main PRs are probably gonna be on the Banana cup with rSL and rSGB from the same time period. Man improved to a 4th WW placement on both categories, with a 2:04.054 and a 1:21.522. With all these amazing PRs he may have gotten <font color=#FF3333>#10</font> for a short time during this News cycle, but I can’t and will never be able to know because my stats page is racist towards Non-SC people. As a frenchie I invite all of you to make a revolution against Penev so that he makes his stat page acknowledge the existence of a timesheet that’s been a thing since 2012. Free the Reds!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#80</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#48</font>) <font color=yellow>Mo No</font> got a 2:22.4 on BC Non-SC, dipped, then came back 2 months later with a bangering 33.209 on my favorite category that is MH Flap. Couldn’t make me happier.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#84</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#65</font>) <font color=yellow>ArthurOww</font> fuck you bitch no nice words for you that’s what you get for delaying the update. Now get back to work you stupid moron (post-production me here, yeah I wrote that, cuz I couldn’t find motivation to write anything and this time for once I was actually doing something so I didn’t wanna spend time writing useless stuff about a timesheet I already know for no one to fucking care because I’m barely average at this game… Wait hold on a damn minute)<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#90</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#47</font>) <font color=yellow>Acquiesce</font> started off the update strong with a PR on his Ace track, a 1:34.703 on rDH No-SC, Spear BKT taken from Cole ladies and gentlemen! Then, after some 1:13.011 on rPB (rip sub), 1:16.020 on MMM (sip rub), 1:09.245 on LC, he finished the year with a astonishing 35.522 on GV No-SC flap, probably trying to legally steal Hydr8ion’s money from the bounty he set up. He couldn’t do it tho cuz he got beaten by Luke. A real shame.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#96</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Star Boi</font> became a Star Man this update, getting a 3/3 signclip run on DKJP.

I mean he’s like barely 2 AF away so it's pretty obvious but shhhh I’m still right.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#104</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Franco</font> only got 2 PRs, a 42.6 on WGM Glitch and a 2:08.4 on DKM, he only woke up from his MKW coma in late December tho so that explains it. I didn’t tell anyone, but I secretly waited for him to come back before writing the News so he didn’t miss any. Next up, I’m waiting until Totom comes back!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#107</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#98</font>) <font color=yellow>NITRO_FOX</font> has been a man on a mission with the destination being the Top 100. He submitted an absolute crap ton of times to end the year, and has also submitted a few in January. These January times are the only non-December times on his timesheet.  Very interesting. Congratulations on unlocking January mode.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#109</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#92</font>) <font color=yellow>Chloie</font> how the hell do you beat 4 people with a 0.7 AF gain??? Hello???<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#112</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#71</font>) <font color=yellow>2ndmatt</font> still leaves me in disbelief as it’s now been more than 2 years that I see this name on the charts yet I cannot comprehend WHY did Bickbork choose this name lmao. Also it makes me think about Matt from Wii Sports whenever I read it so when I see Bickbork on Discord I just associate him to a chad. Yes it’s been like that for 2 years.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#120</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#123</font>) <font color=yellow>James Collins</font> beat me on MH as did like 30% of the people I saw as beginners when I set my time. I should probably improve it… Anyway, the man was decently active as he got 9 PRs but he only cut .6 AF. Still good enough for 2 bops on the charts tho!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#126</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#161</font>) <font color=yellow>Carlo</font> only got one PR so it’s gotta be a heavy hitting one, and it is as the italian got his 3rd WW top and 3rd CR with a 1:41.5 on MT Glitch. Boom. Unfortunate that Jayu left early cuz he would’ve said something funny in italian but since I can’t speak pasta I can’t make that type of joke. Porco Dio is all I can say.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#135</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#91</font>) <font color=yellow>Supreme</font> has had a supreme end of 2023.

Best of luck bro!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#142</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#112</font>) <font color=yellow>Flooferdog</font> floofed his floofy floof and floofed up a KC time in July to qualify for this update. o wait, u also did some red charts stuff.

Will you go for the 1:16.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#191</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#197</font>) <font color=yellow>Will Fury</font> cut AF big time over the past mont- I mean trimest- I mean semester (fuck) as the man went from below Top 300 to well into Top 200 with a <i>128 AF</i> cut.

His most notable improvements come on BC, where he hit a top 30 3lap and flap, finally hitting his goal of 2:10.  He proves yet again that he is a true glitch kiddie.

He got a 1:49 on TF (idk if its glitch or not but im not checking red charts at this ungodly hour - hydr8ion) a 1:09.3 on LC, and a 1:35.5 on RDH. The 1:09.3 on LC leads me to believe it’s a no glitch TF run, but im not sure<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#208</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#168</font>) <font color=yellow>Silicosis</font> continues his goals of removing the “ilic” out of his name and becoming Sosis.

Really solid stuff, glad to see you back!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#225</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#166</font>) <font color=yellow>ElecTrick</font> got a handful of PRs to grab 10 spots with a 9.5 AF cut, good job Mr. Rainiosmile.

Top 200 is coming slowly but surely…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#228</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#178</font>) <font color=yellow>Jeroen Schepers</font> improved his MG Glitch to a 46.4/13.5 in October, but also improved on Yoshi Falls Flap?? Now that’s a random category to PB in.

Hella impressive when you see the rest of your timesheet, congrats on the sub!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#248</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#184</font>) <font color=yellow>Zyxis</font> I just noticed that name would be so OP in Scrabble it’s insane. The guy played BC3 Non-SC and rBC No-Glitch in September and finished with a 2:19.4 and a 2:33.7 respectively, along with the 2  mandatory flaps which are of the same level. All of his times are CR btw cuz he’s from North Macedonia (the Americans are balding just like their eagle). BC3 not being useful for Combined AF however, he ends up gaining 2.5 AF and losing 2 spots on the leaderboard. Sad.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#251</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#167</font>) <font color=yellow>Ragemodepigeon</font> got a 1:43.8 on Raceway in August, dipped for the rest of the year, then surprised us with a big return in 2024 by setting 8 PRs on LC, DKS, BC Non-SC, rSL and rSGB in the span of a week. Brilliant start of the year right there. Much like his fellow updater ElecTrick he got his best for the News on BC with a 2:23.6/46.6 duo (your times are so similar lmao). I can also mention the 21.9 (nice sub) and the 25.5 (nice… non-sub) on LC and rSGB flaps getting onto Top 100. All of this made him barely fall short of Top 250, but with a month of January like his there’s no doubt he’ll get there by the next Update. Good luck lad!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#270</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#195</font>) <font color=yellow>Hockeylord900</font> isn’t from Canada but from the US?? With THIS name?? Oh well.

I hate you parser. At least now it’s fixed lol. Anyway, he then tackled RR which doesn’t seem to fit him well, it’s his worst ranked time by a landslide (815th as I’m writing this) with a 2:37… We’ll see how he handles this obstacle when he comes back!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#296</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#205</font>) <font color=yellow>Woomy</font> enters Top 300, AND GOT MG CANADA TOPS!!!!

Top 400 isn’t the only thing FalB entered this News Cycle though as she’s now part of the mod team of the TT server, and needless to say she, alongside the other 2 people we hired, is doing a great job already.

Only a couple more things and this update is DONE. Procrastination never serves you right Karters, if you need to remember one thing from this shitload of words that’s this sentence right there. Delaying the update only gave me more work to do, and more stress and anxiety thinking about this update to the point where I sometimes doubted my ability to take care of it. Turns out I've finished it, and I couldn't be happier.<br>I’m deeply sorry to all of you that expected and anticipated this News, this should be a monthly update and never should it remain silent for over 6 months like it just did. I sincerely hope you enjoyed this one, hopefully the next one arrives shortly after…<br>Take care everyone. I love all of you who are keeping this game and this site alive and well. I hope it never dies.

        "content": "<p><b>Hello and welcome, my dear Karters and Kartesses, to this News! This one’s not delayed like last time lmao. We’re still in the fresh start of 2024, and some crazy things have happened already, although it’s not as crazy as last year was. Let’s check out what our special leaping February was made of.<br><br><u><b>So, what has happened over the past month?</b></u><br><br>We saw 4 new 3lap WRs on 4 different tracks and an insane 11 Flap WRs on 6 different categories, that’s the highest we’ve got in a month since… February of last year and the discoveries of ODB strats on RR and CM’s glitches. Might as well rename the month Flapuary.<br><br>Going in chronological order, we continue the story from last month on BC where Alex keeps on improving his time with the new Spear shortcut and doesn’t make one, not two, but FOUR improvements from a 41.676 on February 3rd to a 41.252 on the 28th. Impressive stuff from the King, congrats Alex! <font size=1>...see what i did there</font><br><br>A day after KingAlex’s first record of the month, we saw some activity on rWS Glitch where Danny Boy, saddened to not be able to take the 3lap record (2/3 too hard), decided to get 2nd WW in 3lap and snatch the Flap record at the same time, resulting in a big near .3 cut getting a 21.346. Nice job Neptune<br><br>Here’s a name you don’t see getting a WR often, ZCubed actually pulled through and managed to get only his 2nd Flap WR on GV Non-SC! On the 10th of the month he pulled out a 35.482 beating Luke by 4ms. Sadly he got bullied by Logan on the same day, who by the looks of it wanted the “ZCubed will never WR” meme to stay true and got a .446. When will ZCubed break the curse?<br><br>A day later, Justin wanted to get 20$ from Hydr8ion and Arvo but he couldn’t, as the former World #1 failed to sub 18.350 on rYF flap to get the first God standard time here, goal of the bounty set by the two lads running the site alongside me. He still got a .354, enough to get WR from Jack, so nice job.<br><br>Logan also wanted those 20$ but he had his eyes on another God time, rSL Non-SC Flap. That category being extremely rough standards-wise (my former 10th WW time being Legend A still hurts me) it was no easy task, but Logan being Logan, he eventually got the money by setting a 39.646, edging the standard by .004.<br><br>And all of a sudden, only one category remained Godless, being rYF flap. What seemed way out of reach for years could potentially happen. We could actually get all God standards on the site, after so many years. The only obstacle standing in our way, was that one flap that even Justin himself failed to claim, rYF. Could it be done?<br>After his rSL God time, Logan set himself a goal. To get all the God standards… Himself. We were already struggling to achieve a God-only timesheet with only WR times, and this lad, as good as he is at this fucking game, wants to do it himself? Surely he’s crazy, right??? Well, the day after getting rSL, he got to work on BC Non-SC and got not only the God time but the record as well, with a 45.751. He was still missing 5 God times if he wanted to achieve ARR perfection. A long way to go.<br><br>The Flap records are so cool I almost forgot to talk about the 3laps lmao. Connor keeps on his activity from January but changes from DKS to rWS, and improves his own No-SC record by 28ms with a 1:48.247 on February 12th, then Luke comes back to DC on the 15th to reclaim his throne over Logan with a really cool 1:28.321 that “only” gets 2 stairdives compared to Logan’s 3, very nicely driven. 3 days later he also improved on Parkway Non-SC with a 2:10.546, .4 is on the way… Congrats to both of you!<br><br>Last 3lap WR of this update comes on MG No-Glitch, where Alperen, getting like 3 BKPs in the same day at one point, finally managed to get a big improvement to a 1:40.416 on the 20th. .3 is his next goal, though .2 doesn’t seem that much out of reach… so good luck for your future attempts!<br><br>You know me, I can’t help but to talk about Flaps every 2 minutes. Fittingly, we still have one more Flap record to talk about for this update. It’s from Braixen, and even if you might guess the track, you will never guess the time. We’ve seen Justin fail here, we’ve seen countless others finish mere milliseconds away from that major milestone; however, we had never been so close to completing it. How fitting for one of the legends of the game to complete the elusive task of finally completing the prophecy and beating the last remaining God standard to complete the WR time’s Godsheet. Braixen thus makes history and gets the 20$ bounty with the help of a new strat, smashing the God standard by 54 milliseconds with an 18.296. We’ve done it. I wanna say, on behalf of all of the Player’s Page staff, a massive thank you to everyone who committed to the task, from the first ever God standard achieved way back in December 2009 on RR by Jorge to that last effort from Braixen. At long last, the bet made by former players all those years ago has finally come true. Happy ending.<br><br>However, do you know who’s not done? Yeah, you remembered obviously. Logan is not done. World #1 in every category, in Combined or Non-SC, in AF or Total Time… He wanted something no one else had done before. He wanted that perfect ARR of 0, the God ARR. He wanted the Godsheet. And so, he grinded. And grinded. Grinded as a World #1 would grind. And, to almost everyone’s surprise, he was actually getting those God times. It started on the 8th when he got GV2 Flap. Then a day later he got rPB Flap. As we’ve discussed he went on to ascend on the Non-SC Flaps of GV, BC and most difficult of all, rSL, and he also got rDH Non-SC Flap during this time period. Then on the 19th he got rPB 3lap. Then on the 20th he got RR 3lap. When he caught his 62nd God on BC 3lap, the whole TT community had their eyes on their greatest player. On February 25th, the man actually achieved what Braixen had done just a week before, with a smaller margin, as he got the 2nd ever God on rYF Flap with a 18.349. Beating the standard by one millisecond. As the stars aligned, only one single category remained in Logan Kebabby’s way. Three God laps on LC were the only obstacle left to the greatest achievement in the game’s history. Starting at a respectable Myth D standard, he had one mission. He set countless PRs, spent countless hours on the first track in the game. 1:09.140, 1:09.131, 1:09.109. At this point, only 10 milliseconds separated him from his Godsheet. The time to get was 1:09.099. And so. During the night between February 29th and March 1st, on a date that only happens once every 4 years. After a disappointing PB of 1:09.104, the stars aligned on that fateful day. The clock had already hit March 1st in GMT timezones, but people of Wyoming, Logan’s state of residence, were still living their last hours of February. And what a way to close out the month than to finish a Mario Kart Wii Time Trial that would go down in history. Getting onto WW Tops with a 1:09.094, he had done it. The oof guy from Wyoming had done it. As the clock hit March 1st, he was the undisputed God of Mario Kart Wii. My most sincere and admirative congratulations to you Logan, this may be a feat no one else comes close to accomplishing, at least for a very, very long time.<br><br>And that concludes the intro! I call that an intro but it’s really not an intro, especially if you consider the fact that this is already 5 pages long on my Google doc. For one single month this is absurdly long, but I guess there were a lot of things to talk about huh? Anyway, how about we continue the News?<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>COUNTRY OF THE MONTH:</u></font> I said when I started this thing that I would not include <font color=yellow>USA</font>, but for this month it’s hard not to acknowledge what we’ve seen from players of this country, especially Logan, but also Connor, Braixen, Justin. Basically the only WR activity from non USA players were from Luke and Alperen, so even though their standards are the highest of any countries, this month was an insane month even for them.<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>TRACK OF THE MONTH:</u></font> everyone played it during the month from what I’ve seen, both the glitch and the No-Glitch category, so I’ll give this award to <font color=yellow>N64 DK’s “long ass name” Jungle Parkway</font>. I myself even made the fucking glitch, that’s not something you see often…<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <i><font color=#999999>“The part of the brain that makes people play MKWii only works if they are missing every other part of the brain”</font></i> - <font color=yellow>OrangeYoshi</font>, February 7th, 2024<br><br><font color=#55AAFF><u>ANCIENT QUOTE OF THE MONTH:</u></font> <i><font color=#999999>“God overall will never happen.”</font></i> - <font color=yellow>Mick</font>, November 14th, 2009<br><br><br><font color=#33EEDD><i>This News Update covers from February 1st, 2024 to February 29th, 2024.</i></font><br><br><br><font color=lime>Say hello to the 2 new players we count for this month:<br><br>1stmatt (no fucking way we got the full trilogy)<br>Saruu (Spanish goat)<br><br></font><br><br><font color=red><u>The Gods (Top 10)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#1</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#1</font>) <font color=yellow>LOGAN KEBABBY</font> got the godsheet as told previously, I don’t think there’s much else to say as my SummoningSalt-like paragraph earlier on already covered everything<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#2</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#2</font>) <font color=yellow>Justin Hitchcock</font> got his rYF flap as mentioned earlier, as well as a RR Flap, a 1:49.4 on TF Non-SC, a 1:45.4 on TF Shortcut and a 1:31.2 on rMC. He might not be setting PRs left and right like Logan but he still got it!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#3</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#4</font>) <font color=yellow>Arvo Koskikallio</font> got many PRs to comfort his <font color=#33AADD>#3</font> placement and is now 4 AF ahead of Jack. Man’s making moves. He still lost a bet and had to record himself reading out loud the entire wikipedia page of some random shit I don’t even remember the name of, what even was that bet lmfao<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#5</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#11</font>) <font color=yellow>Vincent Braixen</font> got one single time this update and we’ve already talked about it since it’s his rYF Flap. He may have made history, but he didn’t cut much AF with that… Also he got kicked out of the Non-SC Top 10 by the guy right below him<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#7</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#10</font>) <font color=yellow>Mitchell Healy</font> worked mainly on LC and RR and was perfectly in sync with Logan to the point where I would struggle to figure out if the screenshots I was seeing on MKL’s Discord were from one or the other, before coming to the realization that they both PRed at the same time. He got a 2nd WW time on DKS Flap with an ace up the sleeve and a really nice 33.172 Myth A time on Moonview Flap but it doesn’t beat me haha loser (please have mercy and don’t improve this is the only good thing in my timesheet I don’t wanna lose spots this quickly)<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The two lads that wanted to be different apparently (11-25)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#13</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#18</font>) <font color=yellow>Zed R</font> got 4 Non-SC PRs and they’re all absolutely jacked as what we’re used to seeing from Colin. The German #1’s best time this update comes on rMC where he BARELY missed the holy 1:30, getting a 1:31.001, surely you can make the final push! Who knows, with this and a few other PRs you could maybe pass Totom in Combined AF…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#14</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#9</font>) <font color=yellow>Eclipse</font> is the embodiment of how Flaps are key to your AF cuts. This guy cut 9 AF in 9 PRs at this level, cutting 5 placements and getting into Top 15, and he ONLY played flaps. Best one is on KC with a 44.138, 9th on the PP tied with Shane who set his time a day later (lmao). Man I Love Flaps.<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The Legends + Jayu (25-50)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#27</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#36</font>) <font color=yellow>Danny Boy</font> Enters Top 30 by improving his weak categories such as DDR (get 1:50 please), rYF Flap, MG Flap and… rWS Glitch okay maybe he didn’t only play for AF. We’ve discussed this previously so I won’t go much in detail. Top 25 when?<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#30</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#3</font>) <font color=yellow>Luke Brown</font>’s times have all already been discussed because he only got his 2 WRs. It shows, cuz he was <font color=#33AADD>#29</font> in the last News. He doesn’t care about AF. He misses out on the nerdiest and objectively best way to play Mario Kart. Not my fault!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#31</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#39</font>) <font color=yellow>Shane Hogan</font> got some great PRs that allowed him to move 3 placements, with the highlight being that juicy 2:19.4/44.138 combo on KC No-Glitch. The duck is making moves. Don’t drink too much for St Patrick’s day next week, you know ducks don’t drink alcohol!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#36</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#67</font>) <font color=yellow>Exploder</font> mostly stayed in his comfort zone playing rYF and set a banger 4th WW time of 58.752<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#38</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#49</font>) <font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs</font> got too many PRs and cut 13 spots to get into Top 40, the Labies man is killing it this month.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#39</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#57</font>) <font color=yellow>Nara Hiero</font> also enters Top 40, mostly by playing glitches like Parkway or rSGB. The price to pay when you’ve glitched so many tracks, you can’t even improve your blue chart without them lmao. I will take note of the effort on CM though, a 1:58.2 is quite respectable.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#46</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#80</font>) <font color=yellow>JAYOO</font> barely gets onto the News thanks to a clutch parking lot simulat- I mean CM Glitch where the pasta glitcher got a 32.651 that’s not even CR because Cross actually got a .5 the day before this is too funny. Also he got his GV Flap WR printed on a shirt this month so this is clearly the highlight. <br><br><br><font color=red><u>The greats (51-100)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#56</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#142</font>) <font color=yellow>Intel Core</font> mainly worked on his No-Glitch timesheet this month, and although there are some cool things there’s still a lot to work on. I appreciate the dedication though, you’re out here working on your red charts when some people on this site don’t even have a completed timesheet… <i>staring at the guy with a Koopa on Jet Bubble pfp</i><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#59</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#81</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Loerzel</font> has seen the horrors many people made on his favorite track and is not happy about it. I’m sorry but sign clip was easier to learn… also I just noticed the stats page trolled me because he didn’t play this month but since I’ve already written that joke and I like it I’m keeping him in the News, Jacob you can thank my poor sense of humor for this appearance! <br><br><font color=#33AADD>#61</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#120</font>) <font color=yellow>Nate Schultz</font> improved on a bunch of tracks and set cool times here and there like a subbing 2:05.976 on rDS or a 1:44.682 on Moonview, and also he got a Flap with box clip on TF that’s like his 4th best Flap so nice job dude<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#63</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Alex Shoal</font> actually played something else than BC Flap because he also improved on rYF flap after the new strat was found and implemented by Braixen, and this is epic. Could you please complete your Non-SC timesheet though, this isn’t 2008 anymore…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#64</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Bryce</font> improved on SGB Glitch with an impressive 1:15.715 (6th WW) finish on the 3lap, nice job, I find it so funny though how the only other PR you got this month is on the literal opposite type of track that’s rBC No-Glitch, make it make sense lol<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#74</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#61</font>) <font color=yellow>Michele Gallastri</font> got CRs on both CM Glitch (aforementioned, rip Jayu) and MMM beating Sal’s time from October with a 1:16.006 (go 1:15 / EU tops!). One category he couldn’t beat Sal on though was MG No-Glitch where he fell short of 32ms with a 1:41.784. Still cool.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#77</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#65</font>) <font color=yellow>Boshi</font> got 2 PRs on… Both GV2 Flaps? Weird combo but sure, one’s even a 16.445 that’s on WW Tops so we take those. Also sorry I don’t update the forum often but in all honesty I don’t even update often and when I do update I forget that it exists.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#80</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#48</font>) <font color=yellow>Mo No</font> improved on rWS to set the respectable duo of 1:51.8/36.2 and also subbed on rDH alongside it for a 1:35.9. Nice stuff!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#81</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#66</font>) <font color=yellow>ArthurOww</font> I FINALLY moved from the <font color=#33AADD>#84</font> spot I was in since like forever, but now what? With a DKJP glitch under my belt I wanted to improve my CM but I’m the all time worst player on that track so that stayed at a 48 entering March, hopefully I can improve it soon but rn I’m focusing on DDR because my time there is ass and I want to get a 1:49. Watch me not get it and proceed to play a completely different track next. This is usually how it goes.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#90</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#47</font>) <font color=yellow>Acquiesce</font> improved on one of his best tracks, rSGB with a 1:21.908/25.440 pair of PRs. He doesn’t miss.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#99</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#104</font>) <font color=yellow>Cederic</font> cooks on rYF (59.8) and rPB Glitch (1:08.9) to take the last step and enter the Combined Top 100. Very well deserved. Now it’s time to do the same on the superior chart bro (I am totally not biased you know me well I’m only spitting facts, like 34.1 is BKS on MG No-Glitch)<br><br><br><font color=red><u>The good people that got lives unlike everyone you saw earlier (101-200)</u></font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#107</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#98</font>) <font color=yellow>NITROFOX</font> has only registered one single blue chart PR, that’s a 33.1 on CM, but I can assure you he got like 1000000 more PRs he just doesn’t care enough about the PP to update them. Thanks for the AF I guess<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#109</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#70</font>) <font color=yellow>2ndmatt</font> PR dumped on the 22nd so idk if all of these times were set this month but I know for a fact that juicy combo of 1:09.049 on LC and 1:20.864 on MC is from February. He’s proven to the world he can indeed play something other than rMC, and he’s ready to cut some more AF! …Probably, I didn’t ask him tho<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#120</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#107</font>) <font color=yellow>Owen Smith</font> improves his weaker categories to cut AF from the <font color=#33AADD>#146</font> spot he was at last month, although he allowed himself to showcase his Spear skills on rPB and got a 1:13.5/22.6 duo of PRs. Very nice.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#121</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#124</font>) <font color=yellow>James Collins</font> isn’t as active as he used to but he still got one PR for the update, a… 10.9 on Goldmine Glitch Flap. I can’t judge you cuz I got an 11.8 but yeah that’s not the best PB you could ask for…<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#134</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#91</font>) <font color=yellow>Supreme</font> also got one singular PR this update (why do y’all keep giving me more work to do!!), it’s a 1:50.7 on DDR, now I’m gonna mention the fact that I almost wrote flap which is funny because a 1:50.7 flap on DDR is dead last on the charts by almost a full minute (my sense of humor is broken)<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#158</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#166</font>) <font color=yellow>Rheece Wachow</font> pleases me and improves on his No-SC timesheet this month, nice. Salvaged a few good PRs here and there especially in the retros, but DKJP was his best work as he got a subbing 2:14.9 and a very cool 42.9 on the flap, ranked at 34th as his best ranked time in the Red Charts.

Her plans didn’t work out very well though as he beat her back before she could release the vid of her hoarded time, and he actually found out about the hoard before she sent that vid cause of the ghost being in CTGP. Epic fail from the MKItalia dev, but guess what you did well? You actually made me wanna play DKJP glitch. That’s a fucking miracle.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#398</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#237</font>) <font color=yellow>Fireball</font> works with efficiency by cutting 15 AF for only 3 PRs, and thus gets into Top 400 for the first time!

I think he could go far on that game, because it is very feasible that his opposition might die of old age and not be able to contest Hydr8ion's times.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#30</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#22</font>) <font color=yellow>Kevin Miller</font> got banned from lounge for messing with the wrong people.

Cut a ton of AF but not so many spots. top 30 coming soon<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#36</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#45</font>) <font color=yellow>Nara Hiero</font> keeps getting the Canada tops. However I am worried that Quebec might declare independence before the 32/32, you better hurry. Nara got some nice times, including a 2:07.1 on DKM and a 1:43.8 on MH. He also complained about being bad at DKM glitch in call and immediately got it 2 times in a row on SP, nice one!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#37</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#50</font>) <font color=yellow>Jyran Liebs</font> got a 1:15 on MMM as well as his 2/3 lucky glitch masterpiece on rDH. It took him a month to make a video about that just because the run was so glorious. Also he just blatantly targetted me and intentionally beat me on rDH glitch flap by 3ms just to taunt me. Not very sportmanslike, you should respect your elders.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#42</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#33</font>) <font color=yellow>Cqrt3r</font> completed his timesheet.

Unlucky Jacob!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#47</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#82</font>) <font color=yellow>JAYOO</font> is too lazy to write this news update (using exams as an excuse when we all know you will fail them anyways). He got a 1:14 on SGB and sacrificed some of his gray matter for it (this will hurt your exam score) as well as a 1:37.6 on rSL glitch. He then got nothing for 2 months until his 1:32.6 on rDH. Either he is actually studying for his exams, or he really sucks and that time took 2 months to get. I suspect the latter. <br><br><br><font color=red>51-100</font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#53</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#80</font>) <font color=yellow>Jacob Loerzel (#1 sign clip player)</font> lost his WR but at least he still has can still take solace in the fact that he is the #1 sign clip player in the world, and a famous sign clip specialist. In fact, some people actually refer to him as the father of modern sign clipping. In fact, I actually heard one anecdote about Jacob claiming that his sign clip prowess is what truly made him into the man he is today. I am glad that even in this time of sorrow, sign clip is still there for you. Nobody will ever take sign clip away from you, it's here to stay! Huzzah! ok wow he actually got 1:09.3 LC and made the RR glitch that's actually quite cool but not as cool as being the #1 sign clip player in the world<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#57</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#142</font>) <font color=yellow>Intel Core (#1 tree clip player)</font> omfg its the best tree clip player in the world! He started off with getting RR 2/3 like a fucking legend, and then proceeding to play the most random shit ever created to get that sub 46 minute total time. After that, he got the DKJP WR from Jacob, the notorious sign clip specialist. Core also took some time to beat his rWS glitch time, as well as his rDH glitch time and barely missing the sub.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#58</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#121</font>) <font color=yellow>Nate Schultz</font> got 1:18 on MC3, which he said was his, and I quote, \"BEST RUN YET\". I disagree personally, I think a 2:16 on MT is slightly better, but to each their own. Also WW top reclaim on MT glitch with a very funny ending, get in son. He also asked me to ally at 4 in the morning. im sure i can.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#62</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#53</font>) <font color=yellow>Claus</font> got 2:28 RR and a bunch of other stuff. He also broke 100 in all 3 of the GSC D6 finals matches against GAMT and left us in the dust. Good games.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#64</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#70</font>) <font color=yellow>Ultra_Pear</font> omg i'm so tired of writing about random ass PRs and I reached the king of bboring PRs. What has this guy done this month, I'm sure it will be just fascinating. 2:10 on MT glitch I am incredibly entertained, OK that RR glitch run was actually fire and I still watch the PR video every now and again, the L3 is fucking hilarious because I know exactly how that must feel. OK and that KC time where he did goofy strats, and now he is playing MC3 (the most boring ng track in the game bar rMR) Also bro there are gaps in the timesheet with no videos, I am disappointed in you.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#65</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Bryce</font> played some giga random stuff but finally reclaimed his MG glitch WR. Bryce and Idriz will fight over this shit for the rest of eternity, meanwhile everyone else is just twiddling their thumbs, I mean my 27.9 (over 8 seconds behind WR) is still 7th WW so that tells a lot about the state of this category.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#74</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#64</font>) <font color=yellow>Michele Gallastri</font> got a 2:11.6 on BCWii. That's pretty much it.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#76</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#63</font>) <font color=yellow>Boshi</font> loves flaps. He got flap tops on GV2 ng and LC. Also low 2:18 on MT 3lap. You must not play 3lap. Give yourself up to flap supremecy.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#82</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#68</font>) <font color=yellow>ArthurOww</font> is another guy who, like JAYU, is using \"exams\" as an excuse to not write this news update. MKW essayist, more like MKW excuseist. Random DDR PR, random SGB PR. If that SGB PR is with the magi I will allow it. OK, it's not even on chadsoft, so I can't see if it is. STOP CHEATING RUNS KARHUMA STYLE<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#88</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#43</font>) <font color=yellow>Acquiesce</font> got some stuff including a 1:15.8 on MMM and flap tops on rDH no glitch. When will someone finally beat Liam's WR on that category, it's legit the oldest flap WR by like 3 years and people can get .3s without the wheelie cut, c'mon lads can someone beat him already.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#92</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#97</font>) <font color=yellow>Owen Smith</font> got his first RR and MT glitch runs (bro you made RR before MT what THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU). He's been going for rWS glitch for a while, and jesus christ it's taking long. That glitch can die a slow and painful death man, I hope you can get it eventually. He also took a quick break from rWS to casually get 3/3 on DKJP sign clip, but he did not even get close to Invincible, the one true sign clip specialist.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#95</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#46</font>) <font color=yellow>Kasper</font> got WW tops on DKJP ng. I swear Kasper is the most spontanious player, he will just one day decide that some random track is his track, grind it for ages and get on WW tops. If it works it works, props to you.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#98</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>StarBoi</font> got some random shit in march to get mentioned on the news update and he will do it again right after I publish this, I know him too well. You better cut some big AF this time or you will be knocked off the top 100.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#99</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#103</font>) <font color=yellow>Cederic</font> is legit like the living embodiment of \"those who can't do, teach\". This dude gives such great advice, like when I was going for MC glitch he helped me a ton with treeless, and now I look and he imporoves his MC glitch time to a 1:12 in march. I don't think you need treeless for that. Well, at least knowledge is power, as they say.<br><br><br><font color=red>101-200</font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#105</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#69</font>) <font color=yellow>2ndmatt</font> is getting close to 1:28 on DC. I believe in you bro. He also got a low 1:50 on rWS, as well as a 52.908 on GV2 no glitch wow, it's not just rMC where this guy is a tank at. He also alted on Hydr8ion's wii, but it was very obvious because Hydr8ion does not set good times.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#108</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#96</font>) <font color=yellow>NITROFOX</font> oh ffs this is the random guy who joins the TT server calls and says nothing except \"what the sigma\" and then plays sound effects through his mic. I think he probably spends 18 hours per day on tiktok and 6 hours on MKW. Oh ok 1:35.5 on rDH thats pretty cool, and a 2:13.4 on DKJP thats pretty skibidi ohio sigma rizz shut the fuck up<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#109</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#95</font>) <font color=yellow>Chloie</font> ok right I'm starting to see names like these and I know I've entered the territory of times that all start to blend together, let's see here. Yeah I mean 1:14.0 on rPB, I know you can get the sub bro<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#120</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#123</font>) <font color=yellow>James Collins</font> oh yes its Obeisant with his most alpha male vehicle choices. WHAT HE GOT A BCWII GLITCH RUN BUT DIDN'T USE THE SPEAR this is very disappointing, daisy is for normies. And it's a 2:18 with 3 glitches. At least you used Nightcore - Witchcraft as the BGM so I can't hate on it too much.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#129</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#89</font>) <font color=yellow>Supreme</font> is barely not on the top 100 on his new rYF flap. I know you can do it.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#163</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#187</font>) <font color=yellow>Ian Beler</font> set many times, 1:51.5 is the best one out of them.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#166</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#136</font>) <font color=yellow>Dylan Lepeirtz</font> omg 59.999 on rYF, dude must have been so happy, lfg<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#167</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#133</font>) <font color=yellow>Darragh J</font> did NOT set his rPG 1:59.269 last month. But someone submitted it as such so here he is! Congratulations Darragh!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#168</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#94</font>) <font color=yellow>Pabloski</font> cut like 40 spots with a bunch of PBs, love to see more online people dabble in TTs<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#170</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Falco</font> got a 1:48.699 and 4th WW on rWS. Fuck yeah mate, 3rd is so close<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#178</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#171</font>) <font color=yellow>Teovoni59</font> why the fuck is it 59 now, STOP SLIGHTLY CHANGING YOUR NAME!!!!! 2:03 MT glitch nice, very nostalgic time range. Also is that a rBC gold star I see? Not sure but I'm gonna assume it is<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#186</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#84</font>) <font color=yellow>Brian Lai</font> managed to get onto the top 200, and has been streaming his 2:04 attempts on rSL ng. Would be a very cool time, hope you can get it!<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#191</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#146</font>) <font color=yellow>Ben Brophy</font> this is NOT Ben Hurley. This is Ben Brophy, who got a 53.4 on GV2. Ben Hurley has a 53.6 on GV2. Ben Hurley is slow.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#193</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#126</font>) <font color=yellow>Spencer Sassak</font> gives me PTSD due to my MKL + PP data merging script giving all of Spencer's flap times to a Norwegian guy called Lok who by chance has exactly 1/1 ties with Spencer on MKL (they have the same LC time). Oh shit 1:51.8 on TF with mach? 1:18.4 on MC3? Pretty cool mate!<br><br><br><font color=red>200-</font><br><br><br><font color=#33AADD>#202</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#158</font>) <font color=yellow>Ryan Lynch</font> is another news mention farmer who got a 2:33.5 rBC and then stopped playing. See you soon.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#203</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#170</font>) <font color=yellow>Silicosis</font> has 2 videos attached to his timesheet, 1 from 2022 and 1 from 2023. Still waiting for the 2024 one. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess that this guy will fluke a time out that's a lot better than the rest of his runs soon. He got 1:09.5 on LC, I see the potential<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#208</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#157</font>) <font color=yellow>ElecTrick</font> oh yeah, he got 2:29 on RR just 2 days ago, congrats! He does not have pronouns.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#212</font> (<font color=#FF3333>N/A</font>) <font color=yellow>Darien Bawpers</font> is like when you order Justin from Wish, he's been posting some crazy ass online strat compilations that might become the meta in the year 2041. He got a 42.797 on MG which I swear ties an old PB I used to have here. He also got a 34.1 TF glitch flap, but no 3lap run. Big sadge.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#217</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#132</font>) <font color=yellow>Anonymous</font> ayo 1:41 on MG? That's cool asf, bunch of other stuff aswell to cut off an ungodly 83 AF and 81 positions<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#231</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#182</font>) <font color=yellow>Jeroen Schepers</font> convinced me that he's active and should be able to rejoin the private TT server. After that he has set 1 (one) time, which is on MH flap. Swindled again, never trust the Dutch.<br><br><font color=#33AADD>#232</font> (<font color=#FF3333>#204</font>) <font color=yellow>Matt Danner</font> 2:34.8 on rBC.

I will finish this paragraph, go have some lunch, go to the gym, and afterwards come back home and finish this news update in one sitting.<br><br>OK I'm back. So what has happened during the last month?<br><br>Definitely the most notable thing is Justin's new alignment ghost strategy for rSL 2/3, it's only been about 3 days since it has been made public and there have already been many people who have set their first 2/3 runs with it. The players are:<br><br>- Justin (because why not take advantage of what you invented)<br>- Sam F (even lowercaseletters could tell you he would go for it, that's how obvious it was)<br>- JAYU (glitch addict, this was also fairly obvious)<br>- Joeblase (I thought he quit already, wtf is he doing playing this)<br>- ZeldaCubed (this dude having a 2/3 is on the level of WTF as a korben no glitch WW top, I didn't think he had it in him)<br>- Beanzard64 (1:39 - what else is there to say)<br><br>Maybe I'll give this strat a go at some point<br><br><br>Also, the floodgates finally opened on CM new glitch entry and it is no longer a Braixen-exclusive strategy. Beanzard64 surprised absolutely everyone and got his first ever WR with a mach bike entry, the only new player to have set a WR this year so far. Unfortunately he got beat the next day by Braixen, and then Braixen just kept improving. At least he didn't get the >1 treatment, and his legacy will live on in the WR snapshot. I'm sure he will have the 2024-07-04 snapshot bookmarked for the rest of his days, just like me with 2022-04-24.<br><br>After Beanzard's triumph, there were many bandwagoners who got their very own PBs. They were:<br><br>- Core (to absolutely nobody's surprise)<br>- Zoren (read above)<br>- Justin (I'm surprised he still has his wii at this point)<br>- Eli (again, nobody is surprised)<br>- Booshi (French representation)<br>- Logan (4lap BKT with a 31.0 - wtf)<br>- RZ (who?)<br><br>There were also so many other glitch WR, starting up with Bryce finally reclaiming the MG glitch WR. The 2 titans will battle this one out until one of them either dies or ends up in a mental ward.<br><br>Core also became a multi-WR holder, getting a 2/3 on RR and going for kart moonjump after to beat Danny Boy's WR with a slower vehicle. Bro is NOT afraid<br><br>Demon once again popped out of nowhere with a new MT glitch WR, and showing just how much you can still push it, I think Demon should get some therapy, MT is my favourite track also but this level of devotion has to be classified as attachment disorder.<br><br>Vincent N finally got a new SGB glitch WR, pushing it all the way to a 1:13.7. I can't comprehend how everyone pretty much thought the 1:14.5 was unbeatable, just for it to get pushed this far. Just shows how clueless we are as to where the limits are.<br><br>OK moving on, we had some actual skillful WR improvements this month, not just runs where you clip a wall and hope for the best.<br><br>Sosis got another 2 microimprovements on rSL no glitch, pushing it closer to the 2:03.5. In related news, Arjun has still not learned the cave (who would have guessed)<br><br>Emil improved his BCWii SC run (he lost time on the last geysers) and then improved it again (he lost even more time on the last geysers). I recommend mediation and chamomile tea to calm the nerves.<br><br>MC3 had an interesting month, it started off with Kasey finally getting his first WR there. This was followed by Vincent B (the unluckiest TTer) getting a run 1 milliseconds from Kasey's run. After this, Luke showed once again that he might not be the once-in-a-generation MKW sensation he once was, but he is still one of the best to ever do it, beating Kasey by a whopping 19 milliseconds (i hate how this is actually a massive lead on this stupid track)<br><br><br>Also in no relation to any gameplay news, Jared published his community IQ tier list and I am on the Harvard tier. This means you are all fucking stupid and should be thanking me (smartest MKW player) for providing such intellectual takes on the community once again, and presenting them in a digestible manner to you (objectively inferior Untermensch).

He also got a 2/3 time on rSL with the new strat but I'm too lazy to go find out what it was. His toe has not ached so far this month but I heard he developed a slight rash on his elbow, and has been neglecting it.

I only PBd on GV no glitch, then went on holiday and haven't got back to it yet. I'm sure I will play more from now on...<br><br><font color=yellow>#4 Mitchell Healy</font> put a ton of effort into CM, pushing his time down to a 1:56.2. Hella respect, that track is so hard. He played GV glitch flap and rYF flap on the side, improving both. After his CM grind he seems to have hopped onto DDR, getting a time 5ms slower than mine (you suck, n00b), and almost getting flap WR (i take back what I said)<br><br><font color=yellow>#5 Jack Gluesing</font> has played quite a bit. He improved his rPB no glitch time, pushed his MC3 time to a 1:18.1 (woah) and, of course, not forgetting flap and becoming one of the few with a 23.8. After this he decided that rPB 2/3 must be done, and got it. He also improved on MMM once again, I don't know why anyone would play that track but well done.<br><br><font color=yellow>#6 Vincent Braixen</font> got many CM glitch improvements as stated before, and is probably pushing it towards a 23 second time as I am writing this.<br><br><font color=yellow>#7 Vincent Nguyen</font> had 2 goals, improve SGB glitch and learn Vietnamese. He reached the first goal and wrote the longest description I've seen for a run since his last SGB glitch WR.

Welcome back, but bottling Finland meetup unfortunately changed your news update alias from Paul Finnerty back to the old and reliable Ejay Borton. He is also attempting the new rSL glitch attempt on stream right now but sorry man I think I'm gonna watch Karhuma play some WWs instead.<br><br><font color=yellow>#10 Bynt.</font> just failed 2:17 on KC sad doggo moment. 2:04.3 rSL, 1:18.0 MC3, 2:27.5 RR, 2:04.7 rDS, I'm gonna put it out here and say I would definitely invest in Bynt's timesheet, the data speaks for itself.<br><br><br><font color=red>Brahmins - Priests and Teachers</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#13 Danny Boy</font> played like so much stuff, including a BCWii glitch flap which he likely set on psychedelics looking at the video he uploaded for it. he spammed the fuck out of my subscription feed, uploading like every run and pace he ever got. The runs he deemed good enough to be on his main channel were his MC glitch 3lap and flap (you have successfully passed MC glitch flap 101) and oddly enough BCWii no glitch flap which to be fair is fairly clean but what the hell is that BGM<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Dane Allen</font> continued his trackhopping adventures, his philosophy can be summarized by when he got a 1:41.7 on MG stating that he \"could get a .5 relatively quickly\", and when Will encouraged him to do so, he simply responded: \"nope playing cm now I will not play anything for more than a few hours total\". He has not improved on CM yet, so I don't think those few hours were successful.<br><br><font color=yellow>#21 Jyran Liebs</font> improved his rMR time and seemed to attempt to take part in \"no 3lap July\", setting only flap PRs until he couldn't stop himself and set a 3lap PR on DKS. Well, at least you lasted 19 days.<br><br><font color=yellow>#22 Jay Rangthale</font> improved rSL and I'm not even gonna check if he played anything else, I already know the answer is no<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Shane Hogan</font> improved on MH the day after I published my last news update and has not played since. Wakey wakey. (i did also hear he got the new CM glitch entry but threw it away, sadge)<br><br><font color=yellow>#25 Kevin Miller</font> made his way to the top 25. Before I look at your timesheet I just want to say that we were talking about OG MKW in GAMT and someone mentioned Fw Chaos and Bally (our bagger) had no clue who he was, only knowing you. I didn't know it was even possible to be in the MKW community and not know who the OG chaos is. As far as your times go, I will just say this: 39.000 rDS flap, LOL!<br><br><br><font color=red>Kshatriyas - Warriors and Rulers</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Ryley Carroll</font> is MKW's only hope in the 2024 Karter Contest. Considering NMeade won last time, it is obvious that the MKW wave is stronger than it has ever been. He has promised he will only be dictator for one day if he wins. In terms of times, he attended a meetup and improved both his GV 3lap and flap times. <br><br><font color=yellow>#34 Exploder</font> played some cheeky MC3 and also got a new CM glitch time without the new entry. At least I hope the 34.0 was without the new entry.<br><br><font color=yellow>#38 Cqrt3r</font> I'm gonna be honest it is fucked up how there are so many Carter's in the community that you have to spell your name like that. At least you're cool with the fact that you are Carter #3, even including the 3 in your name. Carter jumped all the way to a 1:43.5 on MH, definitely the crowning achievement of this month. Very cool!<br><br><font color=yellow>#41 Olivier Luyckx</font> once again woke up from cryosleep to improve his KC time. Getting very close to 2:17, let's go man<br><br><font color=yellow>#47 JAYOO</font> got a nice sub 1:54 time on rWS with a 1:53.005. And then he got a 2/3 on rSL, with a very enthusiastic remark of \"oh ok\"<br><br><font color=yellow>#48 Intel Core</font> got a 1:18 on MC3 which is pretty good for a glitchscrub like him, then he got the CM and rSL stuff, but also 3rd WW on SGB glitch (JAYU is crying). RR 2/3 WR was pretty fucking crazy too. What wasn't crazy are some random no glitch times he got to boost his total time (you know you are a true glitch goblin when no glitch times are actually holding back your total time)<br><br><br><font color=red>Vaishyas - Farmers, Traders and Merchants</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#52 Jacob \"Sign clip\" Loerzel</font> got some random DDR flap PR so I could once again call him a sign clip specialist in this news update. Thank you, Jacob.<br><br><font color=yellow>#62 Ultra_Pear</font> got a bit too political again and played some woke categories like CM and GV no glitch. True conservatives know that the red charts don't matter. He also seems to have time travelled and set a rBC PR on December 2024. I know can't wait for Trump to win but breaking the space-time continuum is on a new level of impatience<br><br><font color=yellow>#65 Bryce</font> got the MG glitch WR and nothing else<br><br><font color=yellow>#81 Owen Smith</font> fucking FINALLY got the rWS glitch run, that was so overdue and watching the stream highlight was so sick.

Fair is fair, at least you were right in the end. Logan started off with a 1:00.116 run where he lost like 1.5 seconds because he went so far back after the respawn lap 3, truly an artistic move from him. However the real MVP here has to be Zoren, who got the first ever 3/3 landback run, as well as his first ever WR, which has been so long overdue.

He also thought it was stupid that the ending rail strat was considered shortcut, and the people agreed. This lead to him getting another WR, which was beat by yours truly (I am very skilled I know), and then my brilliant and beautiful WR was crushed by .001 by Firestone again.

At least he finally redeemed himself with his excellent BGM for his CM glitch 3rd WW time, definitely being the crown jewel of this month for him. However, to quote Danny, that category \"makes me wanna start an alcohol addiction\". Being now 2 months sober myself, I would not recommend this, I would instead recommend NOT PLAYING STUPID IDIOTIC CATEGORIES!!!!<br><br><font color=yellow>#16 Danny Gallenberger (Boomer Danny)</font> did what he does best, hopping on the new glitch strat bandwagon and getting himself a supremely impressive 1:17.998 and clutching that sub. I like to think the game honoured his legacy and gave him the sub as a token of respect, Danny himself said that this run \"could very well be the last cool thing I ever do [in MKW]\". However I do doubt this a bit, Danny is living proof that the phrase \"Can't teach an old dog new tricks\" is just categorically false.<br><br><font color=yellow>#17 MKRFirestone</font> talking about old dogs, Firestone has been dropping so many bombs recently with his MC glitch and rDH no glitch flap WRs, but he did also get a 2/3 on rSL (even if he did slow down at the end like a foolish joker! Do you not wish to go fast?) He is also cooking something up on rDH glitch flap it seems, and he also got a 1:35.306 on rDH no glitch! I would wager that there's still quite a bit more left in the tank here.<br><br><font color=yellow>#18 Dane Allen</font> makes it look easy with his 1:47 on DDR, 1:33 on rDH glitch, 1:49.8 on TF and 1:56.303 on CM. His mindset towards TTs is captured wonderfully by this conversation from the private TT server:<br><br>Will 14/08/2024 05:25<br>yooo what a time bro<br>go get tops<br><br>Thunder 14/08/2024 05:40<br>it's 9th na<br><br>Will 14/08/2024 05:40<br>i meant ww<br><br>Thunder 14/08/2024 05:40<br>guess you think I'm going to play a track for more than a day<br><br>Will 14/08/2024 06:05<br>What's stopping you<br><br>Thunder 14/08/2024 06:09<br>instant gratification and lack of patience<br><br>absolute brainrot!! At least it seems that you haven't played lounge in about a month, so I am hopeful that he is taking care of himself.<br><br><br><font color=yellow>#21 Jyran Liebs</font> literally just got sub 2 on BC3 SC to clutch out the news update mention. Unfortunately he is still failing on GV glitch to retake the WR from Niyake. Cmon at this point Niyake will probably be so old that he won't be able to get it back, get on it bro!<br><br><font color=yellow>#22 Kevin Miller</font> has like an exhausting amount of new times, I will choose some highlights: uhhhh well he got 3rd ww on rDH flap... idk these are like all really cool times but there are like 30 of them that I'm just gonna have to say that he bopped sosis<br><br><font color=yellow>#23 Jay Rangthale</font> got bopped by big Kev Miller. You see, when you only improve your own WR, you do not cut any AF. You should take notes here. OK to be fair he did apparently get a 1:48 on DKS, but it did not help him in defending his prized #22 spot against Kevin.<br><br><font color=yellow>#24 Joeblase</font> made his way into the top 25 this month by hopping on RR glitch, remarking that he \"made phantom glitch in 30 minutes, lmao, wtf\". Everyone who has struggled on RR for days upon days, please raise a collective middle finger to Joe. He did also play some real category with a rather swanky 1:43.252 on MH, proving that he can also get chains on top of being able to do glitches.<br><br><font color=yellow>#27 Ryley Carroll</font> was able to get his 2/3 on rSL with a 1:28. Aaron W did not believe he would be able to do this, but he once again proved the opposition wrong. I am going to go one further and say that he may also be able to one day get a run on RR glitch that does not fall off after making the glitch. Aaron W might disagree.<br><br><font color=yellow>#28 Luke Brown</font> got WR on KC and 2nd WW on MC3 flap. He also (FUCKING FINALLY) improved his stupid 1:06 on WGM glitch to a 37.6 a month ago which I had to update during the writing of this news update. This cut him literally like 300 positions and went from #35 to #28. The deed is done. Next up: SOMETHING BETTER THAN a 23.6 ON GV, OR ANY MC GLITCH TIME - YOU ALREADY HAVE A FLAP ON THAT<br><br><font color=yellow>#29 Jake Harrison</font> oh would you look at that, another rSL 2/3!!! a 1:25! Wow, how original Jake!<br><br><font color=yellow>#31 Phyz Phyz</font> decided to anonymize his username, however he has decided to keep his fake email (@lmfao.com) on his profile which still has his real name. Interesting. Phyz had a quick gaming stint, getting a 2:18 on KC, as well as a 3rd WW flap time. He also hopped on MC3 flap to get that sub 24, love to see a man here who does not skip flap day.<br><br><font color=yellow>#32 Exploder</font> is a dirty Norwegian oil tycoon who is on twitch 24/7 because of his annual multi-million oil trade deal with Jeff Bezos. He beat my Nordic record on rSL. I must stop listing his accomplishments because of the overwhelming urge to invade northern Norway because <s>of oil</s> those lands are rightfully Sámi, and therefore Fenno-Ugric, and the Norwegian government is mistreating our brothers and sisters.<br><br><font color=yellow>#36 Nara Hiero</font> got himself a rDH 3/3 time, albeit a Ross C/TWD98-esque 1:33.8. Many other great times including a rSL 2/3, but he only cut 1 spot on the charts due to a bit of a gap at the low 70-high 60 range. He's getting closer to the jungle of high 50 AFs though, the top 25 is closer than it seems.<br> <br><font color=yellow>#38 Cqrt3r</font> only improved his MC3 to a 1:18.457. He didn't skip flap day, although leaving the flap as a 24.014 is a bit questionable, the sub is so close man!<br><br><font color=yellow>#45 Intel Core</font>, the only man who has made so many glitches that his bottleneck for total time is his no glitch times once again cleaned up the no glitch times. However, his MH is still a 1:45.5. Aaaaand he's back to his old ways and he's playing MC glitch and got 5th WW. I made <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/9ksfvZ7\" target=\"_blank\">this meme</a> for him.<br><br><font color=yellow>#46 Hunter Wells</font> started off by getting a low 1:19 on rSL but recently hopped on some no glitch, getting 2:00 on rPG, 1:31 on rMC and a 2:05.3 on rDS. Also 39.000 on rDS flap, lol!<br><br><font color=yellow>#47 JAYOO</font> fucking hates the new rSL glitch and says it's his least favourite glitch. What is wrong with him. He got a 1:20.9 on it. He also got a 49 on MC glitch on the same day that the new lap 1 strat was found out (he did not use this strat.) And the BGM that he used for that is called: \"Aborting the Sloughing Seance: Frantic Body Disposal Ankle​-​Deep in the Accumulative Filth of Seven Semi​-​Liquified Corpses I\" from the hit album \"Exquisite Macerated Tissue Slippage and Full-Body Degloving Under Extreme Circumstances of Accelerated Putrefaction\". Therapy is always an option, mi amico Lombardo.<br><br><font color=yellow>#50 Jacob Loerzel</font> has made it into the top 50!! Ultra_Pear could never. He also got a rSL 2/3 (getting tired of saying this over and over and over again) and some rDS flap. Good job Invincible! And don't think I wouldn't mention your sign clip prowess in this news update aswell, you still have the BKT on it!<br><br><font color=yellow>#58 JMM435</font> got a 2/3 on rSL (zzzzzzzzzzzzzz) although it beats me so I can't really hate on it. Also a bunch of no glitch times, getting him closer to top 50.<br><br><font color=yellow>#59 Nate Schultz</font> 1:29 rSL, which is a large shame considering his absolutely legendary 1:42.0 2/3 run is no longer his PR. Big sad. Rest of the times he set are very NPC level.<br><br><font color=yellow>#63 Ultra_Pear</font> ahhh finally someone who didn't play rSL... NVM it's just ultra pear who just isn't able to get one. In fact, he didn't even PR at all since the last news update, but I thought roasting him was so funny that I don't wanna remove it now. Tough!<br><br><font color=yellow>#66 Alex Shoal</font> got the rPG flap WR, it's so funny to me that KingAlex after all these years has strats in this game that literally only he ever plays. Man's gonna be 107 years old sitting in a retirement home grinding out his rPG tree clip flap while Carter's grandson is trying to optimize the no-sc WR a tiny bit more because KingAlex came back 7 years after Carter's death to destroy the family legacy once again<br><br><font color=yellow>#74 Filler</font> came back after all this time to become a major league shitposter, but also prove to everyone that he isn't washed. He achieved 2nd Circumnavigational on rSL with a 2:03.8. Also like, uhh, a lot of other stuff. MH 1:43.1, KC 2:18.6, rWS 1:49.5+2nd ww flap. He also did a bunch of research with Thomas van Deerse to make the red chart champs page happen, arigato Paul-san<br><br><font color=yellow>#78 Owen Smith</font> is the MAN OF THE HOUR. He pulled through on another one of his odyssean grinds, with a RR 2/3 glitch run. Bro really went from having to quit his 58 grind because his parents didn't let him play MKW to getting 2/3 on RR, screaming his fucking lungs out and having his GF run into the room and congratulate him on the run. Man is living the degen speedrunner dream and I couldn't be happier for him. He has already set his sights for CM fast entry as his next grind, which should hopefully not be as carcinogenic as the RR 2/3 one.<br><br><font color=yellow>#82 ArthurOww</font> got a 1:22.202 on MC which makes it into the top 100 on that track, amongst other times that may or may not make the top 100<br><br><font color=yellow>#84 Acquiesce</font> oh man is that a rSL 1/3 I see???? Haven't seen one of those for years am I right??? Ok yeah he also got a 1:29.4 DC + flap of course, as well as a random rPG flap!<br><br><font color=yellow>#92 StarBoi</font> got a 38.6 DKM glitch flap nice nice, also 2:00.2 BC3, you love to see PRs on that infernal category<br><br><font color=yellow>#95 NITROFOX</font> is our latest addition to the top 100, knocking out Nota! We are getting quite close to some legends getting knocked off the top 100, JimmyB and Swiss Alvin are hanging on by a thread, and we already lost Kezer. Surprise comeback to hold onto the top 100 spot anyone? Anyway NitroBozo got a boomerific 1/3 on rSL, as well as one of the most disgusting chokes of all time with a 1:22.001 on MC ng with a 25.1 lap 1 followed by 2 28.4 laps. He must feel that God himself wants to smite him, however he decided to put it much simpler than me, simply stating: \"Not sigma\"<br><br><font color=yellow>#96 Cederic</font> improved on RR ng and MC g flap. He also got a time of 1:39.3 on rSL, and I genuinely cannot tell if that is 1/3 or 2/3. OK it's 2/3. God help us all.<br><br><font color=yellow>#103 Chloie</font> it's another 1/3 on rSL, it seems to be the big hit around the #100 mark here. MF ACTUALLY GOT A FUCKING 1:43.001 rMR 3LAP AND A 32.000 FLAP, I AM DONE.<br><br><font color=yellow>#113 James Collins</font> was so nice when asking for a news update that he inspired me to actually write one. I wouldn't be here writing this if it wasn't for his message, but after like 4 hours of writing my opinion on James is starting to sour a bit... Okok let's see here: MC3 1:18.825 with loads of potential for more, some classic shroomstrat nonsense on rBC and the eventual return to 1-1-1, been there. Alvin van Asselt bop for James this month, making moves.<br><br><font color=yellow>#115 Supreme</font> got a 1/3 rSL, simply stating: \"lol\". Guessing it's not the proudest run for him. On BC3 he got a 44.6 flap, stating: \"cba to crop enjoy\". Something's telling me that this guy doesn't have the highest energy levels.<br><br><font color=yellow>#123 Carlo</font> got PBs on rMC and rBC sc nice<br><br><font color=yellow>#125 Mystogan</font> was busy uploading that video of every 200cc flap WR that I regret to say that I watched all the way from start to finish at work while brainrotting, don't tell my boss. He also played some 150cc, cutting over 10 AF and 9 spots. <br><br><font color=yellow>#166 Andrew Grieve</font> the absolute legend got a 1:49.5, how did I not hear about this? Hell yeah brother<br><br><font color=yellow>#169 Dwt89_</font> got a 1:18.2 on rSL, a rare 2/3 this low down on the charts. Clearly an indication of potential. Is that a first 1:09 on LC I see? AND rYF sub 1? Practically an initiation month for our young lad here, you are now a real degenerate, welcome aboard.<br><br><font color=yellow>#172 Falco</font> finally got his 3rd WW on rWS, making Yang's \"beat Falco on every track\" grind a rather funny meme.<br><br><font color=yellow>#177 ElecTrick</font> got a ton on runs but the one he decided was good enough to upload was a 2:19.880 on MT. Daelyn apparently chugged a pint in commemoration of that run. This is Irish MKW culture right here.<br><br><font color=yellow>#181 Anonymous</font> again just like last time, won't mention any of his times to protect his identity. Good job on avoiding the CIA this month also.<br><br><font color=yellow>#182 Silicosis</font> rSL 1/3 classic classic and like 20 times in August to get him into the top 200<br><br><font color=yellow>#185 Kitty</font> got 2 very simple times. 1:14.2 on rPB and 1:00.2 on rYF. Subs are rather close.<br><br><font color=yellow>#186 Brian Lai</font> got a funny 35.558 on WGM no glitch flap, beating my time by 1 ms, which I then proceeded to beat back by 1ms with a .557 before I got my .4 there. Mostly 3lap other than that it seems. Some nice times in there<br><br><font color=yellow>#187 Thomas Ullrich</font> didn't only set his legendary GV flap, but also sent in new times on LC and MMM on both 3lap and flap. This looks like the beginnings of a grand plan to overhaul his entire timesheet...<br><br><font color=yellow>#189 Daelyn</font> oooo is that a 1:09 LC I see very nice very nice and yes oh my it's a 2/3 on rSL! oh yeah this is the one with the legendary nightcore feel this moment BGM. Also 52.8 MC g 3/3 woodless, rPB 1:07 and 10th EU on RR glitch, this is like looking at my 2018 self living the glitch grind, refreshing to see<br><br><font color=yellow>#193 Will Fury</font> oh wtf another 2/3 on rSL uhhh and to contrast that a 2:02 on CM. <br><br><br><font color=red>People who are below Rhodechill</font><br><br><br><font color=yellow>#216 Darien Bawpers</font> bro only bawp will hop onto a new rSL discovery and come out with a stupid ahh 2:00 time on it, well at least he's still the only person on earth who can do DKM shroomless glitch so his ego won't be hurt too much by me roasting him for being ABSOLUTELY FUCKING SLOW<br><br><font color=yellow>#222 Hockeylord900</font> oh damn 59.4 rYF, love it<br><br><font color=yellow>#225 Sam Fairless</font> was on fire that one night we all played rSL glitch in call, and he ended up with a 1:22.3 on that. He also got a 1:33.5 on DKJP glitch, and then played like a few random flaps and shit<br><br><font color=yellow>#232 Woomy</font> got 59 on rYF hell yeah, LC 1:09+rYF 59 check, welcome to timetrialhood<br><br><font color=yellow>#243 Joe Beaton</font> got a 3/3 on rSL with a 1:09.4 and dropped a fucking banger of a video that made me laugh out loud, great to be able to have a laugh about stupid ass drama from years ago and look back on the simpler times with joy. He also got a big improvement on CM ng, skipping straight to a 1:55.4. Big popoffs this month for sure<br><br><font color=yellow>#245 Zyxis</font> bopped such legends of the game as Jared Black, Anis Taktak and my old 2014 clanmate and facebook friend Julian Stephens who I am eagerly waiting to come back to this game!<br><br><font color=yellow>#258 Tristan Kelley</font> continues his Sisyphean grind of beating Falco on every track, he's up to 16 now! He also has no more Intermediate times now (wow that's crazy I never thought he would be able to do that no way) His natural state right now seems to be grinding rYF and listening to podcasts, he's up to a 59.3 now but he choked Falco bop at the end :(<br><br><font color=yellow>#265 Ivan Andreopoulos</font> finished his timesheet, welcome welcome<br><br><font color=yellow>#287 Mikey Mickey Mike Mikeson</font> again who is this goofy ahh player, I see he got 2:18 on MT, nice nice, grats on the first top 100 time!<br><br><font color=yellow>#300 Thomas Placella</font> His other info field just says \"Thomas Placella\" and his proof status is Screenshot/Time scroll in the year of our lord 2024. Maybe weirdest profile on the PP? He also hasn't played in like 3 years and now drops a random 47.8 RR flap and nothing else? Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I see that GV flap, this is Tubiek, welcome back to the land of the living my fellow GoldenEye community loving comrade<br><br><font color=yellow>#302 Ncsr.</font> 1:14.8 rPB and 33.0 MG flap. What is the reason for these 2 specific categories being the only ones you improve on this month?<br><br><font color=yellow>#308 Skylar Waffle</font> I've been watching breaking bad on the side while grinding DKS and man this guys name is exactly how I feel about Skyler, stop yapping to sigma Walter please.<br><br><font color=yellow>#311 Charlie Brennan</font> finished his timesheet, welcome Charlie<br><br><font color=yellow>#315 Connor GB</font> improved on DC and rSL ng.<br><br><font color=yellow>#334 .VNix</font> the absolute gigabozo submitted times and forgot to actually write down the times. I've seen people forget decimals all the time, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone actually forget to submit the actual fucking time, ggs. Again, all his times are with kart so I don't actually know anything, all I can say is that haha funny .069 on CM and 2:27.4 on RR is quite nice (although what kind of absolute drongo gets a 2:27.4 on RR and the thing they put in the description is \"55th Kart as of upload date\", that's so goofy)<br><br><font color=yellow>#359 Pablo Hernangómez</font> got a 1:18.3 on MC3 and a 1:53.6 on GV, well done pablito<br><br><font color=yellow>#379 Hollend78</font> cut over 167 AF and like 135 positions, biggest AF cut by quite a lot this month<br><br><font color=yellow>#394 ChromaQ</font> MG glitch 14.169 flap. These news update farms are getting more and more desperate each time.<br><br><font color=yellow>#406 Dudu.</font> ok cool stuff such as 1:09 LC, 59.7 rYF, but it seems that recently rYF flap has been his life goal, getting down to a 18.486 there (which to be fair is pretty damn good), the Brazilians are finally finding MKW and bringing their culture of grinding weird stuff into the mix, bem-vindos todos os brasileiros! Bro there is an actual internet forum up for Brazilian and Portuguese top 10s that is still actively getting updated, complete with 15 year old facebook and twitter logos to share the site, not gonna lie I'm kinda tempted to move to Brazil at the moment<br><br><font color=yellow>#423 Chansey</font> set some times that showed a lack work ethic ('go fast' rather than 'do it right') which, in a Petersonian sense elevates sexual archetypes in the marketplace ('fastest monkey')<br><br><font color=yellow>#431 Ben Yafe</font> finished his timesheet!<br><br><font color=yellow>#460 Calum Sutherland</font> yeah we've officially set the part of the news update where I've been typing for over 5 hours and seeing times that are pretty similar to my PBs from 10 years ago when I didn't know what delay drifting meant, I'm sure you can do better than this!<br><br><font color=yellow>#496 Vincent Kwiecien</font> 1:33 MG glitch, 1:28 WGM glitch, 34 GV glitch, a collection of LukeGB ahh runs<br><br><font color=yellow>#516 Charlotte Crego</font> hey yo what's up it's me flanders with a 1:16 on rPB, the day is saved<br><br><font color=yellow>#524 Russell Horwood</font> a collection of exclusively flap times in the #500 range, lovely job, come back next month<br><br><font color=yellow>#531 Dovo4</font> completed his timesheet, and did so nicely<br><br><font color=yellow>#553 Joshua Patterson</font> omg his rYF flap has a video and it's the only one on his timesheet, let's peek the vid, I see first hero time but Joshua is also a top 70 MKDD player, welcome to the zoomer MK!<br><br><font color=yellow>#566 James Woods</font> seems to be cancelled by Hollywood which is a true shame, he put up some incredibly performances back in the day in Videodrome and Once Upon A Time in America. Oh wait no wrong James Woods, this one got a 2:10 on rSL.<br><br><font color=yellow>#578 NE MKPatsfan</font> finished their timesheet with an MMM flap, idk if that has EVER been the last category missing on anyone's timesheet in history. Also bro aint nobody on the player's page forum anymore, if you actually want to talk to people get on the discord BOZO<br><br><font color=yellow>#581 Diana M</font> thank you for the bible quote. I think you could overtake James Woods soon.<br><br><font color=yellow>#625 Zooms</font> got a 2:21.8 on BC3 SC. Yeah, SC. I kinda wanna see this run<br><br><font color=yellow>#628 Charles Schrader</font>got a 1:58 on TF and a 1:22.8 on MC3. Fascinating.
